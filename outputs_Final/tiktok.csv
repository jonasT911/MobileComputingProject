5,2023-04-17 18:09:43,"Upsides: The app allows ppl to find community with likeminded people from all over the world. Allows you to earn your audience, and build your reputation through producing good content frequently. Over all, there is a very positive vibe on TikTok compared to other social media platforms, and the users seem to keep each other in check when it comes to being negative and bullying. It’s more entertaining and many times more informative than tv. It gives you a window into real peoples worlds as well, as opposed to Hollywood scripted scenes and scenarios. There are so many creative people out there freely sharing their art forms, and helping each other out, it’s beautiful to see.   Downside: TikTok needs to build in a better reporting and appeal system. The current system has been weaponized to attack people simply because of opposing views. (I’ve seen people organize mass reporting parties for TikTok on Twitter.) Which isn’t fair to people who are working hard to make good clean content that happens to rub another group the wrong way. It can cause their videos to be removed their accounts to be limited or banned unjustly. Meanwhile very problematic content and malicious predatory behavior seems hard to get under control. I suggest more human discernment, deeper investigations into reports, and possibly repercussions for users who abuse the reporting system.","TikTok, The Last Frontier"

I do not recommend for under 8 years old. Because this app is inappropriate sometimes, but it is a really good app and you can choose whether you want to be a private account or a social media account which means like unprivate it’s a literally got everything you need all your stylist is cooking baking everything you can choose anything for your choices.  There’s so many fun dances you can learn and so many acting skills which I really love everyone’s acting they’re super good at it most of the time there’s anime if you’re into anime and there’s Furrys, but I would say there’s a lot of pick me videos and stuff but this app I have used for so long and I recommend five star because it has everything that you literally want you can research stuff I wouldn’t say it’s better than Google but it’s really good and there’s sometimes ads which like there make up ads in like math problem, solving something like that adds but there’s all sorts of ads so you don’t have to read all of this. This is just for the people who don’t have TikTok yet and are kind of wanting it really bad so go check it out it’s all sorts of fun and it’s so good so bye😆   Also, get this you can say eye👀",THE BEST APP EVER!!💅😆😱😍💀

It really annoys me and I take a lot of breaks just because of this new trend it’s not really good. I know you can’t control what people post but at draw it to the point, because imagine getting a new puppy then you scroll on TikTok and it says “Use this sound or your dog will die” and then your puppy dies. That’s going to far and it needs to stop or else I might be taking a very long break. Tysm for reading this TikTok I know this isn’t your fault but please put a stop to it. Ty!! Byeeee  I’m adding on to that 👆👆the same thing is happening it stopped for a year and it’s happening again but what people are saying is getting worse I just saw and someone said “my mom died” and it’s not ok to joke so if you guys could stop this I would appreciate it because I getting tired of it and I love TT but I have had to take so many breaks because of people saying your pet will die are your mom will die or whatever, so please just try to do something because I like using this app but some of the things are saying are just getting out of hand so that’s all for now bye thank you!!",I love TikTok but..
5,2023-05-02 21:05:14,"I enjoy this app on my free time, I don’t like how it gets switched in the live and then it’s on a continuing cycle of watching live videos. I can’t stand that if I wanted to watch live, I can click on live and watch live but I don’t enjoy watching the live, so I don’t appreciate it jumping to live in getting stuck on it. Also, I don’t like how when I click I’m not interested on a video it keeps showing the same content, Creator, or the same content. I don’t appreciate how many ads have been popping up lately. I understand the ads here and there to keep the Apple live. I totally get that I’m for that but there has been so many. More than there ever was. And when I click, I’m not interested yet they still show up. I find that frustrating. I dislike how many children are on this app yet they’re strippers basically half naked, showing their dance routines.. there’s still so much inappropriate content for a child to watch and when you report a video where it contact creator, I wish they would look into it more and see what is best for the people viewing it not there guidelines because I feel the guidelines are quite as accurate as a contact that’s being put out there so if it’s inappropriate it’s inappropriate and I wish they would take that into consideration, instead of finding no violation in it.",Fun but could use improvements
5,2023-03-15 18:19:59,"Tiktok is literally one of the best+most used apps. I love the way you can make tiktoks and get many likes on them but there are just some problems that need to be fixed. First, people being inappropriate. They need to fix these inappropriate videos just because everyone wants to scroll through tiktoks seeing normal videos and then coming up to one like these. Second, shadowbanning. I have been shadow banned ever since I posted a day after one of my most liked videos. I’m getting only likes from my followers and I’m on the fyp but only getting views. Third, tiktok glitches. My friend made a video and almost the whole video kept on having these grey things that made the video have no potential. She got likes but the video was full of the tiktok glitch. I just want you to fix these things not trying to be rude but just want to have a better experience without having these problems. I also have a good side about tiktok that is just amazing. Tiktok is so amazing and literally you can record ANYTHING without having trouble. You can search up anything you want even stuff you don’t know and it will pop up. I love the music people make and I love how you can favorite videos, songs, etc. Thank you tiktok for being a great app. Just the problems are kind of irritating but not the songs and videos that I see.

I love it so much.!!!!! another cool thing is that TikTok has texting. You can only text with your friends, but I don’t have some of my friends text so I just text them on TikTok. i’ve had Tik Tok since it first was created and I’ve seen it grow into so many cool and interesting and educational things. overall rating is that I think it’s probably either 10 and older or 12 and older. I also see things about how to travel and cool tips and things I could buy and there’s another thing called the TikTok shop, and in the TikTok shop we can buy products that famous TikTokers have created, such as prime and MrBeast bars, if you’re interested in those things, I know a lot of my friends who don’t use TikTok to watch videos, but use TikTok to go onto the TikTok shop overall I love TikTok so much and I’m so happy I have it💕💕💕",So entertaining

To be honest this app may change peoples lives because you know you are not alone when it comes to almost ANYTHING. Heck! What this app brings to the world may even save a life or many. I think tik tik took the time to see how we as human beings who are all different try getting certain things out online secretly or wide open bc it is easy when we are behind a screen and as expected responses piled in and this became a true safe haven for anyone and it helped me see that I am not alone and we can no matter how hard things may get someone has shared success so a lot of emptiness fear and don’t became HOPE  and now and this is a feeling  but also my own knowledge that I have a perfect strangers attention support and guidance as to how they do things.

I was on a live watching this girl do some nails on a other girl but then I said the nails were thick and that my dog has nails long but I was exaggerating and I did tell them that. Now I didn’t know what I was saying was harmful but then this girl said get out of here and called me young and the creator of the live said or did nothing. Then everyone in the live I mean EVERYONE was attacking me and saying I was young and saying to leave and get out and still the creator did nothing but do the same as them I got blocked and I wasn’t able comment sorry. No I’m not proud of the way I acted but what im extremely mad about is that I got blocked but people were saying mean stuff that violated the community guidelines and they didn’t get blocked or nothing but I did I find this completely wrong I reported them on TikTok and now I’m sending a review of my experience that came from TikTok. Please if you can do something make the creators apologize including me and I will do better if you would like account names I will for sure do that I don’t have evidence I’m hoping you guys could see what happened on that live.

5,2023-07-17 15:12:44,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️1st off, you can learn so many new things. Also, you can search up any questions and the answer will pop up. (Most of the time) 1 tip for if you are going to get the app is ONLY LIKE THINGS YOU WANT TO SEE AGAIN. If you like a video about a “lucky sound” or a “please like to help my dog out with his cancer” if you end up liking multiple videos like that, it’s going to be your whole fyp. (For you page) and soon, your going to get sick of that and you won’t be able to watch any exiting videos and stuff like that. Just make sure you only like videos that you want to see again. If your stuck in the situation where your whole fyp is “do this lucky sound or get bad luck. Do it. My dog d!3d” just go in the search bar and search something that you want to see. Anyway, TikTok is an amazing app. If you are underage for it, I am not sure you should download it. It can ruin your entire inoccent childhood. You can come across things that could possibly scar you for life, or give you ideas that could scar you for life.❤️🥳⭐️⭐️🤩😻😔😻😔🧸😡😔🧸⭐️😡😻🙏🥳⭐️🪼💤🐥😭🥪🥪⭐️⭐️🤑🪼😅 Also if you are underage, you might not want to post your face.

4,2023-03-05 06:19:39,"I feel giving 4 stars is right because of all the mistakes on this app , stuff like the reporting system , the fan base ,exc, I have been hacked and threatened on TikTok and I just feel that TikTok let’s there fan base get away with too much , I just wanna complain about the reporting system and how it works because my cousin got her 70k account deleted because she was “underage” somehow and just recently she has gotten her 20k account deleted after just re gaining her followers and doing good , and before they even deleted her account they gave her no time to send an appeal or do anything to get her account back ?? And once you send an appeal it is already to late and nobody has responded to your appeal and ur account that u have worked hard for is gone , I just feel that TikTok only worries about the more popular side of there app more than the normal people who get there accounts deleted for doing nothing but just being themselves and doing what they like and then getting there accounts felted because some child decided to ruin what that person has built for themselves by just writing a small sentence and saying that they are underaged I just think that someone should monitor the account before making the decision of deleting it , There is also Aton of other issues like filters not being open to some people in certain places and TikTok being weird with updates and more.",Rant-ish
3,2023-10-15 20:54:52,"I love TikTok as much as everyone else does, but I’m getting concerned with the shorts people are posting on this app. I have seen lives of very inappropriate things, disgusting videos, and worst of all, hate. This isn’t my only concern, I don’t want to come off as I don’t like this app, since this isn’t a complaint. I have had to take multiple breaks off this app which drove me to making this review, I believe the developer should fix these problems. If I hadn’t downloaded this app none of these memories wouldn’t have been made. Even with the disturbing, and funny videos on this platform, I want to wish the developers or developer— a happy life, along with all the creators with their funny and relatable videos!!  Also, now that I have been on this app long enough to realize the requirements of this judgmental society. It is clear that I think this app is terrific, but I don’t think the age rating should be 12+ , I would recommend for the app to be 17+ since adults can accept or fulfill the expectations of viewers, but minors may become more affected to the type of “fans” on this platform. I wouldn’t want to be a regular person who complains but I have to say, people should be more careful with what they post, instagram and Snapchat along with twitter are probably completely safer. I’m just giving an opinion to rise the rating, so parents could be more strict and not allow their child to be watching vulgarity or inappropriate content.",Well..
4,2023-09-19 19:26:11,"I love tiktok very much but there’s a couple things that would make it more enjoyable and less stressful to use. 1. The automatic refresh happens to me all the time where the fyp will refresh without me swiping down and I also just think this feature is annoying altogether. I don’t understand the point of it. It would be nice if they just had a refresh button that you press rather then having it be a swipe thing because I can’t tell you how many times it’s refreshed by itself or on accident when I didn’t want it to and I’m never able to find the video I was watching ever again. 2. There’s so many hate comments on every single video just about and I know tiktok can’t really do a whole lot about this and it’s not their fault. However, if you guys had a better moderating system where you monitor the comments on people’s videos and delete awful comments I feel like that would be useful. Because not everyone wants to go through their comments deleting all the nasty ones and they still have to read them and it’s just very frustrating to deal with. Other then that, tiktok is an amazing platform and I wish it wasn’t so toxic from all the horrible hate comments and people who are trolling as well as those bot accounts that are always trying to scam you. Ultimately, tiktok needs to do a better job of moderating their app.",Please Improve Moderating Systems
3,2021-06-21 23:34:58,"For all of the hype that surrounds TikTok, it is an incredibly interesting app that plays a major role in the life of most adolescents today. It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‘side’ of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch.",Social Work student here!
3,2022-06-25 23:27:07,"Writing this review I feel bad giving only 3 stars, considering I’m literally obsessed with this app, but there are some major problems (in my opinion) with it. First of all, the app is addicting. I’ve lost so many hours watching TikTok that I could’ve been studying, sleeping, etcetera. I know it’s partially my fault, but I still think more can be done to prevent users from staying on the app for long periods of time. The second thing is about updates. I have multiple TikTok accounts. Every account has a different version of updates. I am also always behind on new updates because of this. When I go on the app store most of the time it reads “open” instead of “update”. I’m very frustrated when I can’t participate in trends because I’m still stuck with a version that is 2 months behind all of my friends. I understand the app isn’t perfect but if there’s an update it should be available to all users at the same time. I know that my phone isn’t the problem, as other users have experienced the same thing as me. Other than this and the fact that I can’t stay off of it, TikTok is a great app and sometimes can be very uplifting and kind. The app allows you to express your creativity and learn to do things you would’ve never thought you would need to know. I believe if these two things could be improved, then TikTok will be the perfect app for people to use as a way to get involved and be their true selves.",TikTok
3,2022-01-23 17:01:00,"I’ve been on TikTok since 2019 and it has its ups and downs. I had a some videos go viral which is pretty cool, but the algorithm is so unpredictable sometimes that most of my content is barely seen even with the use of trends and huge amounts of effort. My biggest complaint though is how broken the moderation system is. It’s unusually strict and even unpredictable. Even when I follow guidelines I still get content taken down, which is confusing and frustrating. On other platforms such as Twitter, Insta, etc., I have never gotten any of my content taken down or flagged ever. I’ve had several TikToks taken down for unknown reasons and the reasons listed are usually vague or wildly incorrect. For example, I used a fake animal prop and it was taken down for “violence” even though I made a disclaimer in the video stating it was a prop and no actual animals were harmed. Despite this, my appeal got rejected so I emailed customer service, which itself is a whole other headache to deal with. It took them WEEKS to respond and all they did was give me a generic response to click the appeal link, which I already told them that I did. It’s as if they didn’t read the actual email at all. Overall, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells now when I post content. It takes the joy out of it. TikTok, if you’re actually reading this, PLEASE fix this. You are literally hurting the community’s content creators.",Oh no. The moderation system. It’s broken!
5,2023-03-25 02:01:36,"I’m a U.S. citizen. Your app has lead us to having real time news not restricted by guidelines of a network. We also are able to learn so much from simple cooking or something as intense as cultural issues in different areas of the US. My country is using your platform as a test similar to the over turning of roe vs wade to gain momentum on silencing the country and keep us from gathering and fighting back. I think that’s why most horrible laws have been passed statewide because it would rarely hit news in other areas of the country. My feeling with the history of how extremist tend to try to win is to eliminate communication within our country from one citizen to the other from state to state. That’s why they are going after you guys literally biggest and best communication app for speed of process but if they win they’ll be able to go after all. In that they will shut down total communication everywhere for Americans other than that our government will be able to crumble what’s left of our country. We are basically being stripped of our freedoms left and right. Hopefully you can get a word in edgewise but uneducated children always are always the loudest.

5,2023-10-10 12:38:51,"It’s like having a book except 100 times more exiting. Where else can you read an article and fact check it at the same time. It’s like having a tv, a book, a news paper, a studio, an audience, and a library all in one. Too bad this wasn’t around 50 years ago. It’s not that Tic Tok is more exiting than books, it’s that Tic Tok works as fast as my mind does….keeps me interested and never boring. We laugh we get sad, angry and even mad but never a dull moment.   I look forward to a cup of coffee and Tic Tok every morning. Usually and typically find the breaking stories several hours before the mainstream media and often times the news that they don’t or simply won’t report. I can’t think of any drawbacks to the contrary only that before posting a comment I learned that I have to chose my words strategically and methodically first, that there are consequences.  The wording and phrasing of a post is just as important symbolic of reality because it as if you are in front of a live audience and in fact are. Opinions and reactions to a post, a video, or a picture does warrant a reaction either way so it’s best to be honest and not hurtful, considerate and thoughtful and not mean and disrespectful. The good thing is if one is not happy simply keep scrolling. What’s more American than that.",Social media experience
2,2023-10-28 11:16:51,"Tiktok is great. I love that you can just scroll and take your mind off stuff. And it stays up to date. And one of my favorite parts is that you can scroll past ads. It’s not just some trap for money. However, I have some complaints. Firstly, I did not allow access to my contacts and it still very clearly uses them. It may be in the terms and conditions, but I find that very violating. Secondly, reports. The TikTok moderators never take into account the context of a comment when you report it. And often times, I will report something for very clearly violating something, and nothing happens. I have also had comments removed before, yet brought right back because they were wrong to remove it. The TikTok moderators do not do their job properly. Too many people get stuff removed for no reason, and too many people don’t get stuff removed when it should be. There needs to be an option to actually type a message when you appeal to plead your case. And there also needs to be a way to appeal a report when it doesn’t go through, because clearly someone doesn’t know what they are doing. I have seen someone get banned simply for existing, and yet I report a video for literally having M-rated content with blood and guts, and yet it has “no violations”. Same thing with harming animals. Or just harmful content that is meant to bring others down. This app either needs to remove reporting, or do their job. I am really getting upset with the reporting feature.",Tiktok
3,2022-11-21 22:01:25,"Hello, not that my name matters but my name is Keeley and this is my first ever time reviewing something but I just thought maybe it will catch someone’s eye and maybe help them. When joining this app, you will experience creative, honest, funny, and tons of different videos. You like the videos you like lost and it creates a for you page for you. But, it will never create a comment section for you. So, there will never ever be a comment section where everyone is nice to each other. You will experience hatred, hate speech, online cyber bullying, and more. I ask whoever is reading this because they’re scrolling for fun or they want to actually know what it is like to have the app. There is hatred, and it is social media. Every social media is full of it and might effect you in a way you won’t even realize. Tiktok is an amazing app, because it requires age restrictions to keep children safe, it requires a lot of safety so kids don’t get hurt. But, if you’re a mother looking at reviews to see if it’s safe for you child, then do not let them get it. Because you shouldn’t have to look through a review to see if a SOCIAL MEDIA app is good for them, because it is not. There are also videos on here that don’t belong on here.

I’m viewed as a mean or bad person when I’m not. So if they stopped counting restored content as a violation that would be better for so many. Also stop taking videos of ppl defending themselves against bullies down and then calling them the bully because that’s mean. Maybe if you let me get views and actually let me a creator I could make better content but you push my videos to people who hate me rather than my own followers or ppl who would be more interested in my content and then bo one likes anything I post because they send my stuff to old white racist men who don’t like me and that’s not fair either. We also need to stop putting automatic sounds on the filters that’s annoying! We need to be able to have harrassing commenters get punished rather than punishing the creators video! Punish the abuser ! The commenter the reporter! I’d really like this app if it weren’t so biased and allows so much hate but the second we do anything to defend that hate we get called the bully and our video is taken down. Soemthing needs to be done,I amOk with it

Be aware of things going on around the world being so connected to so many people and I’m not afraid of anything personal that I haven’t chose to share getting breached or stolen from me I feel tick-tock is a secure app. I’ve seen so much good things come out of the TikTok app just the camaraderie the coming together of everyone if I’m having a very busy or stressful day this is my way to download I can get on here. Scroll through my search algorithm shows me the things I want to see I have the option for not saying something by saying not interested and it doesn’t show up on my feed which I love, unlike Facebook or meta-anytime somebody that I am connected to like somethings are showing up in my feed. It’s so annoying it’s nothing but ads anymore. TikTok is not TikTok is a happy place. It’s a place that you can just be yourself you can share what you’re feeling share the things you like the things you love and just be connected. It’s just a way to get away from the day today stresses when you want to download just have a laugh or maybe even cry I hope this upstairs up I hope there’s no censorship with it. I think that TikTok has done a wonderful job.",Love TikTok!
3,2023-03-17 21:04:49,"i’ve just downloaded tiktok again because it wouldn’t let me log in even though all my information was correct. i researched online to see what the problem with logging in was, and the top statement was to delete it, so i did. i tried doing that about 3 times in a row and it still kept saying “unable to authorize”. at this point, i just restart my phone and after that it logs me in my account. the problem now is that when i want to search, watch videos, create tiktoks, the app always says “no internet connection” or “no network connection” and i’m super annoyed by this because i’ve tried turning my phone on and off, i tried turning my WiFi on and off, i tried having my cellular WiFi on, and yet, no luck. i research about it more, and it says to delete the app or update it. i cant update it because it already is, so i delete the app. i tried over 3 times to log in, and i finally do. the super big problem is that i cant watch or do anything because of my “internet” causing this problem. although, my ipad has tiktok and is connected to the same account information, WiFi, and everything and it works great. i can search for this on tiktok fine, i can choose sounds fine, i can make tiktok’s fine, but on my iphone i cannot. anyone let me know if you have any tips or tricks i can do to solve this problem without me having to delete the app. :)",it’s okay.
5,2021-04-26 19:30:16,"okay like can you please make an option where you can select followers and remove them? i have recently gone private because i now want to lay low and keep everything to myself. i have over 1000, i want to keep about 20 and it’s hard to go one by one and tap each one and remove them. another suggestion that goes along with this one is for when you want to go private, there should be a feature/question that’s like “do you want to keep all your followers? yes / no” and if someone picks no, there would be a list of all the followers and the person can select the ones they want to keep or remove. this would be a LOT easier. also i want to unlink my number to an account, so i could use it for another. it’s so dumb, you know that feature you recently added where you can hop on to another account without having to logout, kind of the instagram one, why cant i connect my phone number there?  please please !! let there be an option to delete all your videos at once. i don’t understand, like two years ago tiktok deleted all of my old videos and now they’re back? i don’t want to have to delete them manually!! please make an option to delete all your videos at once or a select multiple option as well.",SUGGESTIONS !!

I can say how I feel about my fear of getting the vaccine shot without getting band from my account. At first I was completely against getting the shot, but after I was aloud to hear all sides . I decided to get them. I was completely against them to start with simply because Biden ,dr foulice ,( I know I didn’t spell his name right but I don’t care) and Harris are soo dishonest , with us , and flat out lied to the American people so much that we couldn’t and can’t trust a word they say! Then he starts to demand us to get it while letting everyone at the border walk in with nothing. He has shown the American people that he doesn’t care about us at all, if we live or die while he gives everything to anyone coming in at the borders.

4,2022-12-28 17:15:09,"I love tiktok bro, I spent everyday scrolling. But what annoys me sm. Is when i try to make a tiktok and it says access to camera and microphone, but when I go to settings I don’t have the camera or microphone to access it. So I can’t make videos/save videos. And as well is when I report something that has a girl actually breastfeeding with her shirt halfway down and you can see. They don’t take it down. They take down videos that are not against the community guidelines like harassment/nudity/etc. they don’t take that down they take down fun/no problem/not against anything/ etc. they need to get better community guidelines and more let’s say stricter, on videos. I got banned on my account for being underage. Although I know that’s against community guidelines your really worrying about kids underage more than videos that have nudity/harassment/gore/etc. I don’t think I’m your problem, plus I’m pretty sure you should change the age to at least 10+ What is great ———————- Is that tiktok never gets boring for me and I think the best decision was to make a “repost” button. I’ve reposted sm videos that I relate to. There’s not a lot that’s great, I just like watching videos like (GRWM’s) aka (get ready with me) videos, and story’s that people post, and many things. The videos are the main point of the app. And it’s great.",my review personally.
5,2023-01-11 08:40:28,The app could definitely use better customer support. If you own the right to audio material and it is flagged as copy written by mistake the audio will be removed and appealing the decision usually does not result in the mistake being corrected. Terms of service are often violated due to inexplicable mistakes on behalf of whatever algorithm TikTok uses to filter content. The app has a problem with illegal content that is harmful to minors surfacing and being widely shared before it is reported and taken down. There is a problem with the algorithm favoring White content creators over Black content creators. When you report racist material that targets African Americans it is usually not removed or addressed but if you make a video addressing aforementioned racist content as an African American content creator your response is often taken down due to violating the exact terms of service you are trying to bring attention to. Overall the app has potential but the racism on the platform and content that is dangerous to minors means that users need to be monitored by parents or guardians if they are not adults. Hopefully there will be a similar app with a much better algorithm that will surface in the near future and replace this one making TikTok obsolete.,Ok Social Media App for sharing video

3,2023-01-13 03:21:21,"So personally I think it’s a really great and functional app, but there are some downsides which is why it’s a 3 star review. My friends repost video that they relate to or that are funny, but some are really serious. They repost BAD mental health videos and just knowing your friends are going through something similar, putting on a smile when they’re really not okay. And getting exposed to that kind of content ruins your own mental health. Also seeing depressing videos make others people relate and get sucked into this whole other world where they thing their ugly, everyone hates them, their not good enough, basically no self love whatsoever. I personally have learned about new things that have harmed myself. For example eating disorders, I have a eating disorder now because of tiktok/social media because they make you belive you have to be skinny, have an hourglass body, have clear skin, smooth skin, pretty hair, EVERYTHING. I also would like to say I learned about sh which is self harm and now I have it because once you get exposed to it you tend to get sucked into wanting to do it, then a few seconds later boom I have a bunch of red marks in my arms, would buy clothes to fit in even when I hated wearing them. Tiktok made me hate the way I look. So yes it is toxic if you get pulled into this type of situation. But other then that it’s good!! You can learn life hacks, cooking and much more!!",Depends
4,2022-10-09 00:53:12,"My opinion on Roblox is is that it’s alright. Just needs to be fixed a bit, I really like Roblox because you can make a ton of new friends and it’s great, but some people can leak your address and find out where you live. That’s the dangerous thing about it. Something I don’t appreciate is that you can say “hi” or “hey” and still get banned, I don’t appreciate that. I once have said “ hello “ to a friend I have met online and got banned for 3 days. Roblox is a pretty good game but can also damage your vision. I’m not trying to act like a pick me but I assume you should wear glasses. I give Roblox 4 stars because of all of the issues. Another issue that probably all the robloxians hate is when Roblox will randomly have an issue, unexpectedly. You can be playing something and it will kick u out and u have to sign back into your account. This needs to be fixed. The good thing about Roblox is that it is very fun , and u can have a blast on this app. I really like Roblox but not the issues. Roblox is a very nice app and me and my friends will be on it a couple hours of the day, whenever we are bored. I also like that there are a ton of mini games to choose from. Games like royale high , adopt me , Bloxburg , put a finger down , the mimic , and ALOT more. I think you should download the app if you shouldn’t , but please.. be careful.",my opinion on Roblox..
3,2021-12-15 19:23:36,"I love TikTok; it is one of my favorite apps. However, TikTok randomly asked me to confirm my age, for some reason (which wouldn’t normally bother me because I had already confirmed it before),  so I confirmed my age. I put in my real date of birth (I’m 13 years old) and TikTok made my account private, made it to where people are unable to duet, stitch, or download my videos, and I can neither send nor receive messages. I completely understand that TikTok doesn’t want young children to get access to the app and post videos with their face or make unintelligent choices, but I have not done anything against TikTok’s policies or spread any negative energy. I am unable to send videos and messages to my friends or receive videos and messages from my friends. This has also happened to one of my old friends; someone reported him for being under the age limit (he is 13 years old) and TikTok private’s his account. I completely understand if you want people who are 13 years of age or younger to have privacy and not share personal information, but it doesn’t make sense that there are only some people (around 13 years old) that are being forced to have their accounts private’s when others do not also have to go through this.

4,2022-07-24 15:42:49,"Tiktok is a very famous app and has entertaining content that you can find on your fyp. There are some videos that aren’t appropriate for kids under the age of 11, but in order to fix this, you can restrict time limits and what videos they can see. If your kid is super addicted to tiktok, or is on the app 24/7, deleting the app or account is not the solution. This has happened to me once, on accident. I thought tiktok was deleted and I was really sad because tiktok was my favorite  app and I watched it a lot and made many videos on my account. Parents, don’t delete their accounts or apps. Don’t go farther then that. If you go on tiktok settings, you can set time limits and restrictions and you can set it to where your kid can see videos appropriate for THEIR age. Don’t scroll through your kids phone, even I they look worried or guilty that your scrolling on it, they are not always doing something bad in it or inappropriate things. Sometimes they are just nervous you’ll delete the app or account, or lose their online friendships. You can also download tiktok so you can see what your kid posts, and gain them a new follower ! Anyway, the tiktok app is amazing and you can make many friends on this app and express your feelings and post about your life, or maybe gaming! Overall, I love tiktok and this app is amazing!",Great app

I don’t even make offensive videos or anything I hate it when I reload my page my followers went down once or twice and there isn’t even a reason why I need to be unfollowed and it does honestly make me upset I really hope it’ll stop being a thing I like entertaining people but if they keep unfollowing it’ll take away confidence and there won’t be anything new on my page. :/ but otherwise fun to use I would recommend getting if you are bored but beware time flies by really fast when using so if you have somewhere to go I would be careful lol 😅.,Great app but I have a suggestion/issue
5,2020-05-31 18:04:35,"I LOVE TikTok! It made me have better relationships with my friends and it genuinely helped me become a more confident person. But over the past few months things have started to change, and not in a good way. TikTok has stopped put Lgbtq+ and comedy videos on the FYP. (People call this “shadow banning”) Instead of funny videos and videos that make me smile, I find myself feeling trapped on TikTok. I use TikTok to express myself and have a laugh once in a while, but now all I see is politics and inappropriate dancing. There are only a few good videos and everyone hates on them. I miss old TikTok, where if I was sad I could feel happy. If I was insecure, I would learn that I wasn't alone. And I know its great to spread awareness and share the news, but I’m always getting in arguments over who’s political views are correct. This app is mean’t for children and teens. It’s supposed teach you how to spread positivity. Most if the time I learn about dangers in the world faster than my parents. Most if the people on this app are too young to be into politics, including me. (I am 13) And yes, we should know whats going in the world, but not nearly half of the things shown on the FYP (For you page).

2,2022-09-26 06:04:28,"Tiktok Is disgusting they are allowing children to be exploited by their family. They are allowing a child to be groomed by the internet. And though they have nothing to do with it. They need to ban the accounts with children in them period. These children have no idea what their families are truly doing to them. As in the wren Eleanor situation, she has no idea what her mother is putting online. Shes just 3 years old and is having fun being filmed. She has no idea there are creeps on the internet saving her videos and doing who knows what with them. Just as the other kids on tiktok and instagram and really any kind of social media app, have no idea what the comments mean. There are ppl saying they are gonna kidnap a child. They are literally grooming children, and tiktok is allowing it. They love to ban just dancing videos (ones of adults), but when it comes to a child getting groomed by predators on the internet they are no where to be found?! It’s honestly disgusting these accounts are still up. And for any mother or father who runs across this, please i am begging you take your children off social media. Their lives need to be private until they are old enough to even understand what the concept of internet means, meaning a 6 year old is NOT old enough for the internet, any kid under 13 just shouldn't be on the internet.

I suggest making push notifications more customizable as in being able to get all new video notifications from certain accounts. This would also help content creators as well because it would allow their content to be seen more. We are all struggling in this pandemic and I feel this would be a great help for smaller creators in the creator fund. Another problem is how you enforce your rules. I’ve seen countless high follower count, young, fit women showing off more than what should be shown, as there are children on this app, while smaller creators are having their videos taken down with showing less than what the more popular creators are showing off. It is completely unfair and unjust. On one of the pages I follow, one of their videos was taken down for nudity, with showing an appropriate one-piece swimsuit, while there are other videos with much more shown off are still up.

The reason they banned me was far from the truth as I do not drink and I do not smoke and I do not have any artillery. It seems that you were guilty until proven innocent and they really don’t respond to you whenever you submit anything to support and asked to know why or what happened so you know what it was. People can have a vendetta against you or they can feel threatened and then just report you and then you’re just shut down. This happened to me two Sundays ago and then it was removed and seeing that nothing was done on my part and then sure enough another week rolls around and on another Sunday the same thing happened and now it has taken days on the appeal. There needs to be a better process and I don’t think that it’s fair. I do think that TikTok is an excellent platform but they really need to work on customer service and personal interaction. I do agree with one review that I saw on here, where they said that they believe that if they don’t like you for whatever reason whether it is personal parents or whether you’re able to entertain the executives; or whether you’re able to bring in money, then this happens quite often until you are completely banned forever.

5,2023-09-15 02:37:18,"TikTok is a popular social media platform that allows users to create and share short videos. It has become a popular platform for car enthusiasts to showcase their cars and share their passion for all things automotive. However, TikTok can be both great and bad for the car community for several reasons. On the positive side, TikTok provides a platform for car enthusiasts to connect and share their love for cars. It allows them to showcase their cars, share tips and tricks, and learn from other enthusiasts. It also allows them to connect with a larger audience and gain exposure for their content. On the negative side, TikTok can also be a breeding ground for misinformation, dangerous stunts, and reckless driving. Some users may post videos of themselves driving recklessly or performing dangerous stunts, which can give the car community a bad reputation. Additionally, some users may spread false information about cars or car maintenance, which can be harmful to both cars and their owners. Overall, TikTok can be a great tool for connecting with other car enthusiasts and sharing your love for cars.

5,2023-03-31 21:00:19,"TikTok for myself is first and foremost an entertainment app. What’s amazing about it is how it’s algorithm will personally cater your feed to your interests and inevitably lead you to educational content that you are genuinely interested in and want to know more about. With plenty of opportunities to go down any rabbit hole you  receive well paced breaks from related content and even have moments when the app, get this, suggests you take a break and come back later. What started as an app teaching an entire generation how to express themselves in dance has turned into self help, political activism, crowd funding, mental health care, and an amazing fluid way to transfer ideas and of course the most amazing pet and animal videos that will take you on a well regulated entertainment journey. Thank you for your contributions to supporting the LGBTQIA and minority  communities via your app and for promoting a more worldly perspective. We are all on this one planet together and I hope Tik-Tok can help us all band together to protect it, educate ourselves, and share ourselves and our ideas with each other!

I feel more in touch with my true self than I ever have and I am honestly so grateful for this platform. The fact I am able to see every day people just like me talk about their vulnerable moments and that I am able to share content that I create. Yes it can be hard sometimes to get off the app because there is so much content that is wonderful to see but I believe there is an option to put a limit for yourself so you don’t spend too much of your day on here. I never thought I’d be writing a review for any app but I really do wanna put it out there this app is not just for jokes or dancing, although if you’re interested in that stuff I’m positive it’s on there for you.

4,2023-03-24 01:09:44,"Great platform to grow on. Their algorithm works well to reach audiences that want to follow and like your content but… their review process is very annoying. I do motorcycle content (@_OtherAdam_) safety content and funny skits but they seem to hate motorcycles and always flag my videos. My last video didn’t even have a reason, it just said community guidelines. I have tested their review process and I guess it depends on the person that gets to see judge your video and their views. For example it’s as if my videos often fall on the desk of a reviewer that hates motorcycles so they are just inclined to deamplify my video. So when I upload the same video twice. One will get removed because someone who reviewed it thought it was dangerous and the other one will go viral because someone reviewed it and didn’t feel it was dangerous. I’ve been dealing with this for 2 years on TikTok and have 230k followers so I’ve had time to come up with these conclusions. It has to be the only explanation since their customer service is non existent and you’re completely unable to get a hold of anyone regarding a issue. Other then that, it’s a great platform for going viral and most likely the best place to start if you want to be a content creator. TikTok please fix your review process. It’s terrible.",Great for content creators but….
3,2022-07-05 06:42:10,"I Love this App for many reasons, one of them being my ability to creat art! But I have been on the app since it was Musically (over 4 years now). I’m Almost Positive that the app is rigged to only push sexually explicit content, already famous people’s content, or people who have money to pay for their content to be pushed. The app is high school popularity in virtual form. There are so many deserving creators that go unseen on the app including me. I have practically worked two full time jobs trying to create original content that actually means something & constantly go unseen on the FYP, & cannot build my account! No matter how many tips & tricks you follow on this app you won’t go anywhere unless you can meet TikTok’s popularity standards! At this point it makes me wanna rid of the app all together & bring all my friends & family that joined because of my referral with me! Big accounts get bigger for doing nothing while small creators work their back sides off to wow people just to find out Tiktok is never gonna let any of your content go viral. Doesn’t matter how inspirational, kind, or creative it is! If you are drop dead beautiful, have money, or post half naked stuff. Tiktok will not push your content. I have wasted three years & I highly suggest no one else starts if your time and energy matter to you! Luck of the draw my a$$$",So Frustrating/Rigged
5,2023-08-31 13:22:27,"I discovered TikTok during quarantine…. At first I watched “funny videos” about puppies. But it very quickly became a tool to learn. Political events, BLM, covid etc. I feel like it was the first time I could understand and see what people were actually going through. It helped me navigate my emotions and figure out how I could contribute to the world… our country…. My neighbors. It’s taught me what truth looks like and how untruthful the powers that be are. My grout lines are immaculate, I fixed my dryer, learned a ton of new recipes,learned that I’m not the only one fascinated with zit popping. I watched soooo many people become their creative selves, become stronger, teach and most importantly grow. I believe that TikTok has created a true sense of community….at least the start of one. I’m still bothered that the mediators take down content from creators simply because haters report it. There has got to be a better way for you guys to see what true bullying is. Please don’t silence the people that are trying to make the world better, educate us and respectfully show us our truth….science based truth…. Historical truth…. Social truth. They are the ones that will make this world a better place for all of us…. And the earth. I am so thankful for the platform.❤️🌞🌎",People are amazing
5,2022-04-07 23:54:53,"First of all, if I worked for TikTok, I would actually take down videos that need to be taken down because you know how that one dog got ripped up by a pitbull and that took over a month to get taken down, yetMy cousin made a video with my brother doing a dance and on my cousins birthday a.k.a. March 9 the video got taken down after like eight months for grooming which she never did, my cousin was just doing a dance with my brother because they both like what the sound was and yet it was weird how almost every account got banned on March 9 that was not verified like my account with almost 1000 followers got banned for no reason, I was at like 960 followers, please fix this, also, whenever I updated my TikTok today, I thought it would give me like a tag people option but it didn’t. They changed my inbox, removed the favorites button and moved it with the other things like private vids, and liked vids. But they also switched the liked videos and private videos, and I honestly liked the stories and they got rid of it. In one of my captions, I said “TikTok can you please remove the inbox update but keep the stories because I like that?” But they did the complete opposite for me, please just fix this.","It’s good, but please fix this."

There’s lots of fun stuff, my mom is on the burlesque side of tiktok, she doesn’t go on it a lot but I think some things make her happy which makes me happy! So, there is one disappointing thing, that is live’s. You can’t go live unless your sixteen and have 1000 followers. And sometimes if you see someone’s profile which is live and you click on it, it has already ended. Also there are adds but you can scroll away from them so I don’t think they’re a big deal. There are people from all over the world and make lots of different types of content, it’s so easy to watch a lot of tiktok but you can’t sit at on your phone forever lol. It used to be a struggle to get off of tiktok because I was addicted but I’ve gotten over that struggle. Oh, there’s another thing I find annoying, every once in a while there will be a video made by tiktok and it’s things like “hold up, you’ve been scrolling for way to long” etc. and they can get annoying. That’s pretty much it. There’s emo tiktok there’s slime tiktok there’s gacha tiktok there’s plant tiktok there’s animal tiktok etc. HAVE FUN WATCHING IF YOU DECIDE TO GET TIKTOK!!!

3,2022-04-03 23:34:38,"I enjoy scrolling though TikTok. It’s fun and gives me something to do. But I enjoy posting edits I create. I had posted a video, with a single photo of a gun. It took it down for “minor safety” for this I understand. As I look young for my age. And you could not see my dad. But in the state I live in I am above age l have been shooting with my dad for about 2 years now. And have posted a few videos with me shooting. After this video got taken down I reposted it. And made another one with me shooting and that only. This was in December 2021. It has not been taken down since. Then 2 days ago I got I made another video with me and my friend. And got taken down for “minor safety” now both my friend and my dad suggested that it was due to the last 2 photos being in our bathing suits. And I agreed. Although I had zoomed in for that reason. To where it almost looks like a regular shirt or a tank top. I ended up getting temporarily  banned from posting. I then saw I could post again. And so I reposted the video. It got taken down again. I can’t post till tomorrow. I plan on reposting it. If it gets taken down again I’ll repost it again. I’m not going to take down my art because “TikTok says shoulders are not allowed” this isn’t elementary. So stop. I still enjoy TikTok but this is getting annoying. I hope TikTok can fix their community guidelines.",Community guidelines.
5,2020-05-11 04:17:51,"I’ve had tik tok for about a year now, and it’s one of my favorite apps. It’s got some major issues though. First of all, I don’t have a post button. Where it says drafts, there is just one button, and that’s to add the video to your drafts. I have looked up videos on where it is, because I guess I just don’t have one. I have put a lot of work into making tik toks, but I can’t even post them. Please at least tell me why this is happening, or if I’m just being dumb, tell me. Second of all, whenever I try to search ANYTHING, literally anything, it says “sorry this feature is currently unavailable” and I can’t search up anything AT ALL! It’s just super anoying, again just tell me if I’m being dumb, but I don’t think I am. Also it’s the same thing for writing comments :/ Third of all, I DONT HAVE A “FOR YOU” PAGE!!! I enjoy watching tik toks that are related to the ones that I already enjoy. But I still, have looked through the entire app, but I don’t have a for you page. Please try and fix these issues, because I think that they ruin almost the entire experience for me.

We have some very nice people on here and lots of very rud ones also. I am on here to met people from all over and love to watch the different things such cooking, giving advice, make up, doing, hair, and just have fun. Their are plenty of things to watch so if you don’t like something that you see just scroll on by. That is what I can’t understand is why many people can’t understand that. My favorite thing to watch is the elderly people who are having dementia . It is sad but very interesting how their mind works and how the caregivers can handle them. They are so cute and blessed to have family to take care of them. I would like to thank the makers of TicTok for having this so we can have something to enjoy. I am a widower and I watch this instead of TV and get so much enjoyment out of it. Their a few things that seem a little unfair at times but I don’t know the whole story so I can’t know who is right or wrong. There are so very riska things on here but I just watch what I want and keep scrolling. Thanks again for giving us some entertainment that we can enjoy. Silent watcher",Thoughts
5,2022-04-30 20:41:41,"Tik tok is so authentic to the point that it started to make Instagram look bad. Everyone on Instagram always tries to be perfect and fit into society so they can be accepted and not feel alone or like a misfit. Whereas TikTok shows the REAL side. People looking however they looking. Saying whatever they feeling with out out it becoming an unsafe social environment(aka bullying etc). It’s a safe place for me to have fun laugh and share the joy with my family and friends. additionally it’s even more informative than any other social media platform for example at first I was a little confused about what is going on between Ukraine and Russia and Instagram mislead me into thinking America was going into war with Russia through memes, videos etc however I was able to learn more than I ever did through 30 second accurate and precise tik tok videos and even help my friends understand better and correct any misconceptions. I feel as though social media needs more of the real side to people instead of creating a false narrative of what we as regular human beings should abide by in order to be considered apart of the norm I can only speak for myself but I feel as though a lot of people would relate Peace and love",Tik tok is the best social media app period!!!
5,2023-03-18 20:09:52,"Tiktok is my number one reliance when I’m sad, happy, curious, or wanting to see what my friends are doing. Tiktok is so fun to use and I love making videos!! Tiktok has made me realize the good in everything! And there’s LOTS of content on tiktok, you can even choose what you watch! By adding a video to your favorites, you can save it and watch it again! Same for you liked videos! When you follow someone, you can see their videos! If you’ve made a video and don’t want to post it yet, or you want to edit it/save it for later/finish the video later on, you can save it to your drafts! The only person who can see it is you! If you don’t feel comfortable with everyone seeing your posts, you can set your account to private and only your followers can see your posts. You can make a profile picture, a bio to share a bit about yourself, and follow your friends! When you’re confused about a trend, you can click the search button and look it up! You can make audios, videos, live-streams, and more! I think tiktok is suitable for anyone above the age of 10, but that depends on parent options of course! Tiktok is a great app, and I think you’ll enjoy it too! GET TIKTOK!!! 💗🫶 thank you for everything, creators!",I love it!!!
4,2022-01-09 16:21:40,"Overall Tiktok is a really good app in general, however there are just some minor bugs that are pretty annoying. For example sometimes the audio just starts glitching and sounding staticky if you’re recording a video. Another thing is that recently my videos have been delayed after i post them. So i would assume it’s airpods delay however all my videos are delayed now and that’s including ones i posted months ago. Also there are a few things that could make the app better like, when you stitch a video instead of the audio not carrying over, you can have a choice on whether you want to continue it or not. I feel that it would be more efficient and a lot easier if you want to finish an old transition you posted or anything else you might need. I also personally liked the old drafts layout, but it’s fine as is. Another problem is when you’re watching a video and a text or something may be covered by a profile or the caption or anything else on the side, it’s hard to see or read anything so I feel there should be a feature where you can swipe to the left and all those buttons would go away sort of like how it is on a live stream. That’s all I have for now, but Tiktok is a really fun and enjoyable app.","Good app, but somethings could change"
1,2021-09-03 01:36:51,"I love this app. I think it’s a great way to connect with people of similar interests and create a unifying experience for everyone. I’ve always thought of the app as very easy to use and accessible to all people (especially with the captions added to the app), but the new update that caused the drafts button to shrink has been a big problem to many creators. People are fond of their privacy, yet they still love the idea of making videos. This leads to many creators making little cringy videos that they would then just save to their drafts to post later or to just save the sound. Many have that muscle memory of just automatically clicking the middle of the drafts button, but because of this new update, they have been accidentally posting their drafts. Not only is this a nuisance to mentally check every time that you are not posting a draft, but it can be very compromising to creators who need videos to be only saved in their drafts, away from their followers. These people would be minors or others who are uncomfortable with their face being public, Islamic women who like making videos with their hair but cannot show their hair to the public for religious reasons, and others who make videos for themselves and not for the public eye. This new update has caused a lot of frustration in the community and as an enjoyer of this app, I, and the whole community, would please like it if the drafts button was changed to its original size.",Drafts Button
1,2022-12-20 04:05:35,I loved this app until recently I ran into complications. One day I say a video and thought it was funny and shared it to my friends. Didn’t realize that none of them were being sent and it was because it was saying that every time I sent a message that it was violating the community guidelines. I even sent the letter “O” and told my girlfriend “I love you” and those were immediately taken down too. I did an appeal and they all came back and said it was a mistake. Then it would happen again. Today I went to log into TikTok bc for whatever reason I was logged out and it said that my account was permanently banned because of multiple violations of community guidelines. This is me coming back for being inactive for several days and just and apparently it banned me just for logging back into the app bc I wasn’t banned according to my girlfriend and my emails until I logged in again. Never have been banned before but yeah permaban right out of the get go and the best part is that it didn’t even give me the option to appeal just let me request to download my data whatever that means. So yeah years of memories down the drain bc of that dumb bug. Trash app. Unless I get my data back I’m never using it again because that’s a waste what’s to stop it from happening again anyways? I’m not the first and they didn’t get their accounts back either and apparently they never even got called back just ignored so yeah I’m done.,Trash app permanent ban for no reason
5,2023-11-09 05:08:26,"Hello TikTok, if you are reading this, here’s what you need to understand: I am a video editor, and I get to work with other people’s content. I understand that your new Creativity Fund constantly rejects my videos for being “unoriginal”, but what you need to understand is that while the content itself comes from other sources, I always give credit by using hashtags, my TikTok bio says that everything I make on the app has credit due to Dreamworks, music writers and more. The originality behind my TikTok’s are the ability to take something old and crafting it into something new; give a movie character a new personality and psychology, if not go deeper into it. Also, when the Creator Fund rejects my videos and appeals, not only are you taking away my ability to invest in higher quality video editing tools and software, rejecting every TikTok from the Creativity Fund will cause other TikTok creators to stop using the app, therefore, decreasing its popularity, attractiveness, and ultimately, its relevance. Do you want to stop paying me TikTok? I have a multitude of fans to inspire, as well as funds to make to support the app and other creators by all means. This isn’t all about me, it’s about everyone who uses this app.",TikTok Needs to Understand This

It can be great entertainment and a great place to learn about different things and topics.  HOWEVER the biggest issue I have with this app is nudity. I have seen probably 20 videos where men had their penis in full view or slightly out of view in the last 2 months. And they do NOTHING about it. I’ve reported so many videos and they always say it “doesn’t violate guidelines” and you can’t get them to reconsider. You can’t write anything to help them know what the report is exactly about to help them see the issue, if it isn’t in full view right at the front of the video they don’t care. It’s honestly infuriating. It’s actually insane. They aren’t even hidden well, any person with eyes can see it but they just don’t care! It’s disgusting. The videos will get mass reported and called out for the nudity and nothing happens! They say this app is for 12+ and you can’t have an account if you aren’t at least 13 but that’s not fool proof. And even then 13, 14 and 15 year olds shouldn’t be seeing that. It’s disgusting. Their team is extremely lazy and terrible moderators. Don’t let your kids on here for their own safety. Not to mention all the pedos, I know they can’t necessarily do anything about that. Don’t let your kids post and don’t let them use the app.",Not for anyone under the age of 16.

Didn’t work. I log out of my alt and try to log into my original account but it says it is “Timed Out” I try to make one more account after deleting and downloading the app again, Only to find that I have been “using service too much” or something like that. Also, the people on Tik Tok are very toxic. It doesn’t do anything about videos or comments that are homophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist etc. The content can be extremely inappropriate, too but they do nothing about it. A lot of people on Tik Tok are bad examples. It has lots of perverts and there is a concerning amount of swearing on the app. A lot of kids watch Tik Tok and start swearing or doing inappropriate dances. There aren’t always trigger warnings on videos, either. I have seen some people traumatized bc of some Tik Tok with dead kids in it. There are videos of people doing inappropriate dances. I know people that have being banned for no reason. You ban them yet you keep up the videos of women dancing in their undies?

1,2023-08-02 00:14:53,"I have had my fair share of issues with many websites when it came so spam, scams, and horrible content that shouldn’t be allowed on the platform, and for the most part they are good at detecting spam accounts and fake content… not great, but most of the time it gets done or at least worked out.   TikTok does none of this, and instead plugs its ears and says there’s no problem. A majority of the accounts that like my posts or bookmark my videos are fake porn accounts trying to steal private information, and in spite of making multiple emails to TikTok and filing over 100 reports towards these fake sex accounts, they have told me there’s nothing they can do about it. Furthermore there are constant issues with e-beggars who steal other people’s content begging for cash or straight up pirating movies and making money off of them, as well as multiple pornographic posts that have been reported and TikTok has insisted don’t violate their TOS. Even many of their ads are scams or spam as well, leading to fake sites pretending to “go out of buisness! We have 99% off sale on product!” or “We’re hiring! Click link below for more info!”  I have never ran into so much spam on any other social media platform in my life, and I have never had this many issues with the company refusing to listen to me when I show them the problems at hand.

Every single time I try to follow an account it always says you’re following people too fast. Which is not even true because I haven’t followed somebody in a long time and I’m only following 112 people right now it has been saying this since like 415 which is ridiculous. Normally I would right it’s a 10 out of 10 or a five star out of five stars. I just want to follow these accounts but it’s not letting me and that is why I am upset so yeah. Update from me 3 years in the future: I was recording a little video for fun that I was NEVER intending to post trying out a new filter and when I went to watch the video tiktok glitched and made me post it to my story, before it was all the way done posting I left the app and powered off my phone on hopes that it would not post and just save the video to my drafts. I waited a minute then powered my phone back on swiped out of TikTok then got back on it and my daft was POSTED. I am very very upset because I know that people will see that TikTok EVEN THOUGH ITS ALREADY BEEN DELETED.

TikTok has changed my generation so much, (hear me out I know this sounds like something your grandpa  would say), there’s just something wrong with all of us, I think it is because TikTok is so addictive. The short videos on this app make our patience way shorter, and our attention span. The addiction of TikTok keeps you on your phone 24/7, when you are addicted to something you put it above all else, even other human beings, real people with feelings. I’m not making this up, I am seeing it happen to people I know, I’ve seen this generation get meaner and meaner everyday, it could be because of the mental illness trends or the selfishness the addictions push. And the terrible racist algorithm is another reason people are so upset on TikTok, POC creators are getting banned way more than white creators are, and POC creators barely get any reach.

On top of that, if you make the mistake of opening the newer friends tab, it just switches between an “add contacts” pop up and a “your friends are on TikTok” pop up. There’s no way to exit out of it fully and you can’t even just go back to one of the other tabs, you have to fully exit the app which, again, almost always completely resets everything for no apparent reason. A lot of these issues are recent, but for the love of god please fix them because right now the app is borderline unusable.  Also the way it treats its creators with recent content violation rules is absolutely awful and tends to target already suppressed voices. I’ve seen countless completely fine videos be stripped because of the auto-report system, it’s a major issue. In general, there needs to be less content suppression for having more controversial themes, especially since the app markets itself as a way to stay up to date.

In one of the latest updates, the ability to search up videos was removed, and I just don’t see this benefitting anyone or anything. How does this make the app better? How is this improving the app? How can I feel comfortable updating this app when it’s highly probable I’ll end up regretting it, and the odds are NOT in my favor??   After discovering this feature was removed, I went to the App Store and saw that there was another update available. Thinking this would fix the issue and very poor choice on the devs’ behalf, I updated the app. Opened it and the format is completely ruined. There is now a seemingly pointless dislike button attached to each comment and ruining the formatting of the comments, the favorites button is now taking up an unnecessary amount of room on the screen, and there is a new “Friends” tab on the bottom of the screen that just isn’t useful.   What’s the point of any of this? Why add these useless and hindering features, and yet continue to take away the things that make the app more accessible, the things we truly need? As an avid user of Tik Tok, I am fed up.

1,2021-02-18 21:48:22,"TikTok has TOS and community guidelines that only work if you are either making them money, or if you conform to what they want. Not only this they will make up bogus violations against certain people that are not even real violations of terms or guidelines. For example they will ban accounts of people just for eating. And worse than that they don’t always review stuff and when they do it’s just personal opinion on their part if they like it or not. Also they will suppress content creators like cosplayers or just ban their accounts all together for no reason. They also claim to have rules and stuff against bullying and harassment yet instead when someone comes to them about being bullied or harassed TikTok will punish the person being bullied by suppressing their account and making it so their videos don’t get seen as much rather than dealing with the actual bully, and they also will do this same suppression and content hiding on people who they don’t find attractive, people with disabilities, and people who they think are overweight. Some people don’t have these problems because TikTok just picks and chooses who to cause problems for. The list of problems goes on and on. People need to be aware that TikTok is a horrible app and is not user friendly to certain people just because it doesn’t like them.

After I would close out the app and get back on later, all of the creators I followed and all of my liked/saved videos would disappear. Not only that, but when I first attempted to upload a profile pic and bio, I received an error message saying I reached my daily limit. I let it go and tried again for the next few of days but with no luck, I kept receiving the same message even after 24 hours. The only thing that succeeded and stayed were my email and phone verification. I became so frustrated with this app that I stop using it for the next couple of days. Tonight I decided to give it another shot, only to receive a message saying that I “violated guidelines” and my account is now banned….. How does any of this make sense? I couldn’t use this app for the most part so what were my violations? Was liking BTS & Christian content my violations????? My main reason on getting this app was to watch Jungkook’s TikTok’s and lives, but nooooo, apparently I can’t do that. There’s truly no point on making another account because it’ll probably get banned again for no valid reasons. So with that being said, to my fellow Army, if you happen to see this.

3,2022-12-23 23:12:25,"The app is ok. Definitely has potential to be a great marketing tool EXCEPT for the fact that it upholds a racist infrastructure. White content creators often are allowed to be blatantly racist and spew *actual* racist propaganda and slurs while Black, Indigenous and other POC communities have to walk on egg shells just to keep their accounts from being flagged or banned. Also, the apps algorithm allows white creators to flourish while actively suppressing Black creators’ content. This creates a disparity when it comes to money to be made because more often Black CCs set the most popular trends and receive little to no recognition from the app or other non-Black, specifically white CCs—especially after the trend/sound has become viral. There is also the apps (those who work for/regulate) involvement in the conspiracy to suppress historical and currently relevant information. It does a great job at censorship. If it were not for the app taking constant punitive measures against anything Black and POC CCs make that doesnt directly uplift & support white supremacy and comfort, then this would be a cool place to be. Right now, theres a Black woman follow train trend happening. Not only are we seeing the vitriol from angry white women who are offended they werent centered in a Black space (shocker), we are also experiencing delays and outright deletion when requesting or accepting our Sisters. Do better Tik Tok!!",Well…
5,2021-08-06 06:41:38,"TikTok is a fun app to watch dancing, comedy, cooking, hacks and many more videos. I would 10/10 recommend getting it if you haven’t already. If you are a parent figuring out if your child should be able to get TikTok just know that some songs and some dances are a little inappropriate for the younger kids. If your child is 11+ I would say they will be fine. The app itself is organized very well, so you save videos and sounds to look at later. You are allowed to have a private or public account depending where n your comfort. A private account means that you have to send a request to follow the user. This also means that you have to follow the user in order to watch their videos. Having a public account means anybody can follow you and anybody can sit and scroll through your account. You can remove followers. When having a public account, your videos may also be on the for you page. The for you page is videos you can scroll through of content that is recommended for you based on what you like and save. This is how many videos go viral. So an overall rating on this app, 10/10 would recommended, it keeps you busy all day and there is a video out there that will make you laugh.",TiktOk
4,2021-10-29 00:43:41,"I recommend TikTok, here’s why. TikTok is a great place for socializing. Better than other apps, TikTok asks what you like then shows it on your fyp, you can also customize what creators and specific content is on your fyp by liking videos and following creators.  There are fun trends to follow, with cool filters as well! You can have 8 accounts in total and they won’t be connected to the others, (so if you want a secret account, no one will find you). You can favorite sounds and videos, comments, etc.    That was Tiktoks good features!      Now for the not so great ones. These are the reason TikTok got a 4/5 from me.        So, TikTok has something called community guidelines, to keep every young child on the app safe and just cyber bullying under control in general, but the thing is, these guidelines are commonly false. For example, I got banned on a account with over 1000 followers for bullying even though I was duetting myself saying I was improving. And dumb things get removed on TikTok, such as videos, accounts, and comments. But then there are some cases where someone is doing something so wrong and it doesn’t even get removed until it gets over 1000 reports. That’s messed up. Other than that, tiktok is a great place! I recommend it! Just watch out for those guidelines! 😬👍",GET TIKTOK

Maybe you can send me a link or contact me on how to change my name on my profile and on my videos besides Carol. I would like to change my name and not use my real name.

My 5 year old daughter died from ligma(a rare form of tuberculoses) he last words were”ligma balls” this happened last week and I greif her passing. I currently work at “Sugonma’s Burgers” and I make $4 an hour. I was staying at the creepy old man’s house but he died of Sawcon so I have nowhere else to stay anymore. I couldn't take it anymore. I found my dad’s old hunting rifle and I was going to shoot myself. I thought about my entire life for 1 brief moment. The last words that came out of my mouth were “ Hey guys, I guess that’s it”. I pulled the trigger but the Top G Andrew Tate was taking bullets out while I was thinking about my life. He told handed me an iphone 13 ultra pro max with unlimited battery with a bugatti car key on it. He then said “breath air, you don’t need a vape”. He then vanished into heaven. I looked at the phone but there was only one app. It was Tik Tok. It was a gift from the gods. A god named Andrew Tate. I was hooked to it.

2,2023-09-19 03:38:07,"Tik-tok has undoubtedly been the most toxic and infuriating social media app I have ever used. Objectively speaking, the app itself is alright and has no identifiable flaws within its basic functioning. Contrarily, an extremely large portion of the users along with the content they put out makes viewing content tiring and frustrating. Whether or not the videos in my feed are influenced by the ‘algorithm’ is questionable. I am constantly being bombarded with extremely controversial viewpoints, none of which I am fond of, and am finding it almost impossible to eliminate this content from appearing. The ‘not interested’ button seems to have little to no impact on whether or not I see the content again and sometimes feels as if it has the opposite effect. The few times I’ve found success in adjusting the content in my feed I’ve had to dedicate an unreasonable amount of time immediately swiping past and posts I want to avoid. As time-consuming as this process is, I find that there is no delay whatsoever in reverting back to the old feed I try desperately to distance myself from. I’ve even went as far as creating a new account to try to avoid countless topics that I’m sick of hearing about. Within hours, regardless of my viewing habits, I am back to square one. I have used this app on and off for 3 years and have found that periodic breaks are extremely necessary.",Frustrating and tiring
1,2023-05-17 18:13:12,"I was really excited to start using TikTok about 2 weeks ago. As an app, I absolutely love it. I did prefer the older version of tiktok, without the “find relatable content” at the top of every tiktok and without your caption sliding upwards every time someone likes. But, as soon as I tried following ONE person, I wasn’t able to. It unfollows them as soon as I leave the page. I’ve researched this problem, and A LOT of users experience this. Sometimes it goes away, but after MONTHS.  I figured they might be verifying that I’m a real person for the first few days, but it’s been TWO WEEKS. I logged out, logged back in, created a whole new account (still didn’t work), cleared cache, updated the app, deleted other apps, uninstalled TikTok and installed it again, and reported a problem through the app TEN TIMES. Every time, it’s just an automated bot reply, saying that there was suspicious activity. I verified my email, checked my settings, yet still nothing.  This is incredibly frustrating, because I’ve never spammed anything in this account. There’s no way to reach any real people or agents so it’s just unfair. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to follow anyone ever, or if it’s going to go away and when. I genuinely enjoy TikTok, I think it’s the funniest app HANDS DOWN, and the comments are always the funniest. But, to not be able to follow other users is incredibly frustrating because there’s no email or phone number you can reach out to.",LET ME FOLLOW USERS
2,2022-10-18 19:43:25,"Very disappointing.. Once every 1-2 weeks the app will switch on its own to the newest update from the older version. Then I’ll have access to post Stories, Tiktok Now photos, and use other features but the moment I close the app- sometimes if I just switch apps for a moment all the new features disappear and the app reverts to a previous version. When that happens, I can’t see anything I created with those new features.. This issue has been going on for more than a year. I’ve asked for answers from Tiktok support, done all their basic troubleshooting, and sent them screenshots and videos of the issue. All I get back are the most irrelevant, unhelpful copy/paste responses from support staff that aren’t even trying to understand the problem.  It’s extremely disappointing to know that an app with virtually unlimited resources can’t manage escalating issues like these to the appropriate departments to get answers to users. Even if nobody knows why I’m having this issue, they could just say that. But the way they respond to user issues truly gives the feeling they’ve gotten so big they don’t care about every users experience. Aside from algorithm and censorship issues with creators getting videos taken down and accounts wrongfully banned, this is something Tiktok really needs to work on. The user experience is lacking.",Great concept- inconsistent access to features
2,2022-02-28 22:20:54,"Tiktok is a very great app that I like and I never hated it until now. Ever since 2020 There’s a lot of racism in the app that hasn’t been stopped a lot of inappropriate info that hasn’t been stopped, but small accounts or accounts that have done nothing are getting banned. Today for no reason I uploaded a video showing the evolution of my pictures, after that i edited my bio and switched accounts. when trying to switch back to my main i couldn’t and it told me that I was permanently banned for violating the community guidelines. I couldn’t Appeal at all I wasn’t underage and I have never posted an rude or racist video that would have caused me to get banned, tiktok has not only banned me but they have also banned my friends for no reason. I just want to know why I was banned and if I can appeal.   that part of my review was in 2020. i am on my 4th account now because i was banned over and over again. they don’t tell you why, and just ban you when you have a height following. i just reached 3k after a year of trying to grow my account. i spent hours crying and figure out why i was banned and they told me it was because of minor safety. i’m 13 and i still get banned for that reason. they said that anyone under 13 is banned but im not. people over 13 just have certain limits. i give them this rating because if they way they treat their users.",I like tiktok but got randomly banned

4,2020-12-29 03:58:34,"Okay, here’s my review. This APP IS WONDERFUL. But there are some down sides to it. So, I deleted this app once but I wanted it back so I can use it on my spare time. So I just got it back and apparently I can’t get back into my old account. I saved all the data but the password doesn’t work. I’ve tried a bunch of times. It’s probably a bug. Anyways, my second “but” is that even if you don’t want an account and your trust trying out the app, don’t pull up the pop-up that says “SIGN UP” or “LOGIN IN”. I honestly don’t want an account for many reasons. Bullying, mean comments, inappropriate things, ext. At this time-period, you don’t have anywhere to be, or anything to do besides hang with your roommates (roommate), family members, or yourself. Trust me, it’s tough. But at this point social-media is our life now to figure out things and to learn more. (This probably has nothing to do but I’m trying to give ideas and my opinions). Sometimes I try to not open this app up because I don’t want to see the pop-up where it says to “SIGN IN” or to “LOGIN IN”. Please don’t get me wrong but this app is incredible because I use it on other devices. But this device I use daily needs this app! Thanks for letting me share my review.

I thought okay well I guess that’s okay to get banned. So I kept posting and everything was fine. At that point only one of my videos got banned. I hadn’t posted in a couple days so I decided to post a video of the song “Thank you next”, by Ariana grande, org pictured of horses at the barn I ride at. Just the horses themselves and at the end I put a picture of me and another horse. It was a selfie and you could see a lot of the horses face but a little bit of mine.

I was too sick to be social, post or like; but I still wanted entertainment. Somewhere I could see comics, musicians from around the world, new artists - mindlessly - but only TikTok of all available apps, had “Take a Timeout” commercial to suggest a break for you when I spent too long online.  Where every other app is attempting to force me as a user to do things their way (changing format to keep people on, forcing other users other than your friends into your Feed whether wanted or not, or were just becoming repetitive to me); with TikTok, within days, I was watching my favorites, along with suggestions for others; and the algorithm helped find exactly what I was looking for; all by scrolling or amount of time spent watching. It became my reward, when I was getting treatments or a having a really awful rough day; I could lose myself in old & new becoming favorites that had a built in post on self care, saying do something else besides be on their app.  I can’t name another app that does this, and I am hoping that it won’t be taken down.",My favorite go to

I enjoyed the content I was seeing , and it helped keep me entertained during the many months of being stuck bored at home. However, when life did start returning back to normal, my usage of the app didn’t decrease. I was stuck scrolling many times throughout the day, and by the time classes returned in-person, i would still find myself scrolling…even during class with an earbud in. i dealt with some personal issues during 2021 and my feed was beginning to change, relating more closely to what exactly was going on in my own life. i felt lonelier, sadder, and my attention span was becoming terrible- it was affecting how well i performed in school exams, how long i would spend  practicing music, and long films became harder to sit through. i felt engrossed with this addictive never-ending cycle of scrolling through short videos…and i decided to finally pull the plunge and straight up delete the app, and delete the THOUSANDS of videos saved to my camera roll, (which i never even re-watched in the first place), and i could almost instantly see an improvement in every aspect of my life. this app literally changed the way my brain worked for quite some time, and now i feel like a new person without it.

I didn’t care that much though, because I had other accounts and I used them more often. About a month ago my friends tiktok got banned, for no reason, along with her spam and her cousins account. She also brushed it off, even though it hurt she just made a new one. Today I get home from school and the worst thing I could ever possibly imagine happened to me.

But I’ve tried to report for multiple reasons. Do I get listened to? No. Tiktok doesn’t even read the reports. I spend my time writing reports to keep the environment on tiktok safe. They will not listen to any of them so I will be posting on here my complaints instead. I have a few complaints regarding blocked accounts and adding new accounts. My account, 17._.Brook._.17 was blocked a few months ago. On that account I had countless memories and would’ve liked to keep some videos. Instead all of the videos were taken away and I couldn’t save any! I have made a new account but would still like to have the videos from my old one. Also I have been trying to add another account under the same phone number or email as mine but it will not let me make more than two accounts.

I think that you should be able to report someone and they would not be able to go on with doing the same thing they did, though thankfully- more than one person has to report the user, but indeed I have an idea you could add! The person should be active on their account at least 3 days so the same person does not report them with different accounts they are making. I suggest this app for many people that should be at least 10, basically double digits due to multiple swears that are allowed on this app. Maybe more edit options like, example; Camera swinging from on direction to the original video. This app is definitely absolutely perfect for people who enjoy making videos for others to see and enjoy! Though maybe make accounts get to the for you page more since its uncommon people search up a hashtag and find your video. Though I absolutely can’t stand this app, it’s amazing! And for another suggestion you should definitely add, make notifications for people messaging you and not allow spam if that is already added to the app, I suggest this app for you if you are looking forward to getting it!

One day I downloaded the app and made an account to watch my kid’s videos they made, and in less than 24 hours I was hooked. The algorithm is awesome, the community is awesome, it’s always there when I need a good laugh, and sharing TikTok’s with family has become a great bonding time, tbh. Now with the STEM related FYP having been added, it’s even better! Based on the amount of likes on some of the STEM videos it’s clear that the entire world enjoys “nerdier” videos, too. You learn something new every day on TikTok, and I think that above all else is my absolute favorite thing about it. If heaven forbid they ban TikTok, I will definitely not be going back to old social media like F📖, T🐦, S👻, or I 📸, they are worse than TikTok will ever be when it comes to invasion of privacy or promoting dangerous things to minors AND adults.

But recently there have been a lot of updates mainly focusing on the drafts and the draft button and I just wanted to point out how much everyone hates it. The draft button went small and now the size is back to normal just because so many people complained about it. But now the drafts are weird. Just stop messing with the drafts it was good how it was before. Another thing, we can’t screen record drafts anymore? Whoever came up with that idea is obviously a very dumb person. Some people don’t like posting their tik toks and would rather screen record them to post in snapchat. Another thing I wanted to write about concerns the lives. I’m 15 and I like going live all the time, my lives however are always getting banned. You guys may be too old to realize this but a great majority of the tik tok population is under the age of 15, and it gets me so frustrated when I see a bunch of other lives with people doing way worse stuff than me not getting banned. It’s just not fair, instead of focusing on things that are actually bad going on in tik tok you guys are focusing on banning 15 year olds for joking around and going live.",Updates are bad

Just wished tiktok would stand behind the creators more. We get a lot of hate when we are known and popular. Always getting reported for things that aren’t against guidelines. And being reported multiple times no matter you appeal is and they put it back up every time. They will delete your account for multiple reports and that is not fair at all. I feel they are a bit biased as well. What the young ones get away with us older ones do not. I’m on my third page and I do nothing wrong. I can help I’m so gorgeous..god made me this way. Otherwise i love the app I love all the wonderful people I’ve met from all over the world and friends I’ve made along the way. They have come along way with their filters and tools to edit. Great music to choose from and so much more. I would recommend Tiktok 100% Just be careful there are lots of scammers and hackers on the site. But that’s everywhere these days.

4,2023-03-24 16:05:06,"There’s no denying how entertaining this app is. And if you’re just watching TikToks, not posting, this is probably going to be a 5-star experience for you. As a content creator, it’s been a bit different. I’m enjoying the success I’ve had in the short amount of time since I created my account, but I gotta say the auto-moderation is just awful. Nobody should ever have a ban enacted on them or a video automatically removed just because the mod AI picked up a no-no word without context, or because people who simply don’t like the content reported it instead of scrolling. And there’s no real way to talk to a human being if you’d like to discuss issues like this. I’d love to have actual humans deciding what happens to my content and my account. And I’d love the option to speak to an actual human when I need to hash out account-related issues. I mean, I like being here so I bend over backwards to try and meet community standards while still retaining the humor that brought followers to my account in the first place. But these auto-disciplinary things still happen, often for no really good reason, and that is super frustrating. Otherwise, it’s a really fun app and I like it. Obviously I’m still around.

What it does is just shows us who they really are, all their ignorance and hypocrisy, the way they’re trying to keep us at odds while they commit crimes of epic proportion, lying and stealing from us. So many clips you wouldn’t normally search for of a boring and or political nature brought to you highlighting their favorite past time, self serving. And I’m not concerned about China spying on me, Zuckerberg already sold my information to the highest bidder. I go to TikTok as frequently as I go to telegram, the others are child’s play.","TikTok is not what they’re claiming, fortunately."
2,2022-06-06 00:45:12,"Recently on the app I came across an ad for pens, that were only a dollar. Since I want to have a nice pen for fun and stuff I decided to get one. What I did not realized that the scam company would automatically sign me up for a membership without my knowledge. I did cancel the member ship as soon as I found out about, I don’t even know if the pen will look like it did in the picture I saw. I’m just mad about the fact that TikTok let that ad on there website probably knowing that it was a scam, there had been a video posted 3 days after I saw the ad explaining that’s it’s a scam. I know TikTok may have not seen it yet but it still bugs me that TikTok could have prevented this scam and they didn’t. There are other ads similar to the one I clicked on, and those have been on there for awhile. If they are scams why isn’t TikTok doing anything about it, why are they ignoring this, what is wrong with them if they are ignoring it. I just don’t want to fall for anymore scams or have anyone else fall for. I hope TikTok just thoroughly check ads and their websites to make sure they are not scams before allowing them on the app, but I kinda doubt that they would do anything about this. Other then this I quite like enjoy the app, so I wouldn’t think trust most of the ads on TikTok anymore. There are some you can trust, but other then that don’t trust them yet.",TikTok supports ads that are scams
3,2022-05-18 21:22:56,"TikTok has easily become the most prolific social media app among all different demographics ranging from prepubescent to geriatric. It’s a wonderful platform to learn new information that is engaging and can even teach you new skills. I love that about this app but the one thing that I cannot and will not ever go along with is their censorship protocols and how their algorithm is trained to be extremely sensitive to look for keywords, phrases, names and places. TikTok will flag your video and remove it for a “community guidelines violation“, however, they failed to tell you which community guideline you have “violated“. Within the past year, TT updated their T&C to include a specific “community guideline“ that you “violated“. For a couple of months it was being implemented but now it has gone back to just a notification that your video was removed and one option to press one button, “appeal“. You cannot write or attach any supporting documents when appealing a video that supposedly “violated“ their community guidelines. Having easy access to information from all around the world is what average every day citizens want but that is not beneficial for the mainstream media so censorship is the “go to”. TikTok has a lot to work on regarding censorship even though they are a Chinese owned app.",Great app but needs serious improvements regarding censorship
4,2023-05-12 00:34:03,"Look, I love tiktok and I have been using it o n multiple accounts for the past few years, but recently I broke my phone and I got a new one and everytime I tried to sign into my account it would tell me that the password was wrong (It wasnt I had it written on my notes.) and when I pressed ""forgot password"" and I completed the thing and pressed sign in, it said ""login failed"" or ""login error"" or something like that. I had already made a different account I was just trying log back into it because I had a lot of saved/favorited videos but then it logged me out of my other account which I had already started. I was very frustrated but I thought it was a bug so I just created a new account and went on with my day. A few days later, my friend gifted me her old account even though I had made a new one after that incident, and when I tried to log into that one, it logged me out of my account. I still thought this was a bug until one week ago. I had made 2 accounts on 2 different devices and instead of flipping through them because of notifications, I was gonna sign into one of the accounts using one of the devices. But guess what happened, it logged me out. Im really frustrated and I hope tiktok fixes this bug.",Please fix this.
1,2023-09-13 11:57:51,"For the context of this review, I’m going to state that I’ve just created an account on here and am getting started with using the app; or at least, I was. I followed a couple hashtags, tried liking some videos and following people so that my for you page was more custom to me, since that’s what the algorithm is for, right? Guess not.  After a long session of scrolling - to be fair it was probably way too much time on my part - I noticed that everyone I tried to follow was just… not in my list. As in, I wasn’t following anyone. Anybody I did try to follow was immediately removed from my list, and any videos I tried to like were no longer listed in my likes. After some googling I found out that TikTok apparently shadowbans you from using the app’s features if you like too many videos or follow too many people in a short period. I get that this is a feature created to prevent botting, but… why create an app that’s meant to keep you scrolling and watching, and customizes the content based what you like and who you follow, and then punishes it’s users for using these features? I followed so many cool people and now I can’t even figure out how to find them again because I don’t remember their usernames and their videos aren’t in my likes.  I spent way too much time on here anyways, so I guess this is a sign. Since my account is unusable I might as well just delete it.",Punishes people for using the app… in the way it was intended?
5,2023-04-17 18:09:43,"Upsides: The app allows ppl to find community with likeminded people from all over the world. Allows you to earn your audience, and build your reputation through producing good content frequently. Over all, there is a very positive vibe on TikTok compared to other social media platforms, and the users seem to keep each other in check when it comes to being negative and bullying. It’s more entertaining and many times more informative than tv. It gives you a window into real peoples worlds as well, as opposed to Hollywood scripted scenes and scenarios. There are so many creative people out there freely sharing their art forms, and helping each other out, it’s beautiful to see.   Downside: TikTok needs to build in a better reporting and appeal system. The current system has been weaponized to attack people simply because of opposing views. (I’ve seen people organize mass reporting parties for TikTok on Twitter.) Which isn’t fair to people who are working hard to make good clean content that happens to rub another group the wrong way. It can cause their videos to be removed their accounts to be limited or banned unjustly. Meanwhile very problematic content and malicious predatory behavior seems hard to get under control. I suggest more human discernment, deeper investigations into reports, and possibly repercussions for users who abuse the reporting system.","TikTok, The Last Frontier"

I do not recommend for under 8 years old. Because this app is inappropriate sometimes, but it is a really good app and you can choose whether you want to be a private account or a social media account which means like unprivate it’s a literally got everything you need all your stylist is cooking baking everything you can choose anything for your choices.  There’s so many fun dances you can learn and so many acting skills which I really love everyone’s acting they’re super good at it most of the time there’s anime if you’re into anime and there’s Furrys, but I would say there’s a lot of pick me videos and stuff but this app I have used for so long and I recommend five star because it has everything that you literally want you can research stuff I wouldn’t say it’s better than Google but it’s really good and there’s sometimes ads which like there make up ads in like math problem, solving something like that adds but there’s all sorts of ads so you don’t have to read all of this.

It really annoys me and I take a lot of breaks just because of this new trend it’s not really good. I know you can’t control what people post but at draw it to the point, because imagine getting a new puppy then you scroll on TikTok and it says “Use this sound or your dog will die” and then your puppy dies. That’s going to far and it needs to stop or else I might be taking a very long break. Tysm for reading this TikTok I know this isn’t your fault but please put a stop to it. Ty!! Byeeee  I’m adding on to that 👆👆the same thing is happening it stopped for a year and it’s happening again but what people are saying is getting worse I just saw and someone said “my mom died” and it’s not ok to joke so if you guys could stop this I would appreciate it because I getting tired of it and I love TT but I have had to take so many breaks because of people saying your pet will die are your mom will die or whatever, so please just try to do something because I like using this app but some of the things are saying are just getting out of hand so that’s all for now bye thank you!!",I love TikTok but..
5,2023-05-02 21:05:14,"I enjoy this app on my free time, I don’t like how it gets switched in the live and then it’s on a continuing cycle of watching live videos. I can’t stand that if I wanted to watch live, I can click on live and watch live but I don’t enjoy watching the live, so I don’t appreciate it jumping to live in getting stuck on it. Also, I don’t like how when I click I’m not interested on a video it keeps showing the same content, Creator, or the same content. I don’t appreciate how many ads have been popping up lately. I understand the ads here and there to keep the Apple live. I totally get that I’m for that but there has been so many. More than there ever was. And when I click, I’m not interested yet they still show up. I find that frustrating. I dislike how many children are on this app yet they’re strippers basically half naked, showing their dance routines.. there’s still so much inappropriate content for a child to watch and when you report a video where it contact creator, I wish they would look into it more and see what is best for the people viewing it not there guidelines because I feel the guidelines are quite as accurate as a contact that’s being put out there so if it’s inappropriate it’s inappropriate and I wish they would take that into consideration, instead of finding no violation in it.",Fun but could use improvements

First, people being inappropriate. They need to fix these inappropriate videos just because everyone wants to scroll through tiktoks seeing normal videos and then coming up to one like these. Second, shadowbanning. I have been shadow banned ever since I posted a day after one of my most liked videos. I’m getting only likes from my followers and I’m on the fyp but only getting views. Third, tiktok glitches. My friend made a video and almost the whole video kept on having these grey things that made the video have no potential. She got likes but the video was full of the tiktok glitch. I just want you to fix these things not trying to be rude but just want to have a better experience without having these problems. I also have a good side about tiktok that is just amazing. Tiktok is so amazing and literally you can record ANYTHING without having trouble. You can search up anything you want even stuff you don’t know and it will pop up.

I love it so much.!!!!! another cool thing is that TikTok has texting. You can only text with your friends, but I don’t have some of my friends text so I just text them on TikTok. i’ve had Tik Tok since it first was created and I’ve seen it grow into so many cool and interesting and educational things. overall rating is that I think it’s probably either 10 and older or 12 and older. I also see things about how to travel and cool tips and things I could buy and there’s another thing called the TikTok shop, and in the TikTok shop we can buy products that famous TikTokers have created, such as prime and MrBeast bars, if you’re interested in those things, I know a lot of my friends who don’t use TikTok to watch videos, but use TikTok to go onto the TikTok shop overall I love TikTok so much and I’m so happy I have it💕💕💕",So entertaining

Now I didn’t know what I was saying was harmful but then this girl said get out of here and called me young and the creator of the live said or did nothing. Then everyone in the live I mean EVERYONE was attacking me and saying I was young and saying to leave and get out and still the creator did nothing but do the same as them I got blocked and I wasn’t able comment sorry. No I’m not proud of the way I acted but what im extremely mad about is that I got blocked but people were saying mean stuff that violated the community guidelines and they didn’t get blocked or nothing but I did I find this completely wrong I reported them on TikTok and now I’m sending a review of my experience that came from TikTok.

(Most of the time) 1 tip for if you are going to get the app is ONLY LIKE THINGS YOU WANT TO SEE AGAIN. If you like a video about a “lucky sound” or a “please like to help my dog out with his cancer” if you end up liking multiple videos like that, it’s going to be your whole fyp. (For you page) and soon, your going to get sick of that and you won’t be able to watch any exiting videos and stuff like that. Just make sure you only like videos that you want to see again. If your stuck in the situation where your whole fyp is “do this lucky sound or get bad luck. Do it. My dog d!3d” just go in the search bar and search something that you want to see. Anyway, TikTok is an amazing app. If you are underage for it, I am not sure you should download it. It can ruin your entire inoccent childhood. You can come across things that could possibly scar you for life, or give you ideas that could scar you for life.❤️🥳⭐️⭐️🤩😻😔😻😔🧸😡😔🧸⭐️😡😻🙏🥳⭐️🪼💤🐥😭🥪🥪⭐️⭐️🤑🪼😅 Also if you are underage, you might not want to post your face.

And once you send an appeal it is already to late and nobody has responded to your appeal and ur account that u have worked hard for is gone , I just feel that TikTok only worries about the more popular side of there app more than the normal people who get there accounts deleted for doing nothing but just being themselves and doing what they like and then getting there accounts felted because some child decided to ruin what that person has built for themselves by just writing a small sentence and saying that they are underaged I just think that someone should monitor the account before making the decision of deleting it , There is also Aton of other issues like filters not being open to some people in certain places and TikTok being weird with updates and more.",Rant-ish
3,2023-10-15 20:54:52,"I love TikTok as much as everyone else does, but I’m getting concerned with the shorts people are posting on this app. I have seen lives of very inappropriate things, disgusting videos, and worst of all, hate. This isn’t my only concern, I don’t want to come off as I don’t like this app, since this isn’t a complaint. I have had to take multiple breaks off this app which drove me to making this review, I believe the developer should fix these problems. If I hadn’t downloaded this app none of these memories wouldn’t have been made. Even with the disturbing, and funny videos on this platform, I want to wish the developers or developer— a happy life, along with all the creators with their funny and relatable videos!!  Also, now that I have been on this app long enough to realize the requirements of this judgmental society. It is clear that I think this app is terrific, but I don’t think the age rating should be 12+ , I would recommend for the app to be 17+ since adults can accept or fulfill the expectations of viewers, but minors may become more affected to the type of “fans” on this platform. I wouldn’t want to be a regular person who complains but I have to say, people should be more careful with what they post, instagram and Snapchat along with twitter are probably completely safer. I’m just giving an opinion to rise the rating, so parents could be more strict and not allow their child to be watching vulgarity or inappropriate content.",Well..
4,2023-09-19 19:26:11,"I love tiktok very much but there’s a couple things that would make it more enjoyable and less stressful to use. 1. The automatic refresh happens to me all the time where the fyp will refresh without me swiping down and I also just think this feature is annoying altogether. I don’t understand the point of it. It would be nice if they just had a refresh button that you press rather then having it be a swipe thing because I can’t tell you how many times it’s refreshed by itself or on accident when I didn’t want it to and I’m never able to find the video I was watching ever again. 2. There’s so many hate comments on every single video just about and I know tiktok can’t really do a whole lot about this and it’s not their fault. However, if you guys had a better moderating system where you monitor the comments on people’s videos and delete awful comments I feel like that would be useful. Because not everyone wants to go through their comments deleting all the nasty ones and they still have to read them and it’s just very frustrating to deal with. Other then that, tiktok is an amazing platform and I wish it wasn’t so toxic from all the horrible hate comments and people who are trolling as well as those bot accounts that are always trying to scam you. Ultimately, tiktok needs to do a better job of moderating their app.",Please Improve Moderating Systems
3,2021-06-21 23:34:58,"For all of the hype that surrounds TikTok, it is an incredibly interesting app that plays a major role in the life of most adolescents today. It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‘side’ of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch.",Social Work student here!
3,2022-06-25 23:27:07,"Writing this review I feel bad giving only 3 stars, considering I’m literally obsessed with this app, but there are some major problems (in my opinion) with it. First of all, the app is addicting. I’ve lost so many hours watching TikTok that I could’ve been studying, sleeping, etcetera. I know it’s partially my fault, but I still think more can be done to prevent users from staying on the app for long periods of time. The second thing is about updates. I have multiple TikTok accounts. Every account has a different version of updates. I am also always behind on new updates because of this. When I go on the app store most of the time it reads “open” instead of “update”. I’m very frustrated when I can’t participate in trends because I’m still stuck with a version that is 2 months behind all of my friends. I understand the app isn’t perfect but if there’s an update it should be available to all users at the same time. I know that my phone isn’t the problem, as other users have experienced the same thing as me. Other than this and the fact that I can’t stay off of it, TikTok is a great app and sometimes can be very uplifting and kind. The app allows you to express your creativity and learn to do things you would’ve never thought you would need to know. I believe if these two things could be improved, then TikTok will be the perfect app for people to use as a way to get involved and be their true selves.",TikTok
3,2022-01-23 17:01:00,"I’ve been on TikTok since 2019 and it has its ups and downs. I had a some videos go viral which is pretty cool, but the algorithm is so unpredictable sometimes that most of my content is barely seen even with the use of trends and huge amounts of effort. My biggest complaint though is how broken the moderation system is. It’s unusually strict and even unpredictable. Even when I follow guidelines I still get content taken down, which is confusing and frustrating. On other platforms such as Twitter, Insta, etc., I have never gotten any of my content taken down or flagged ever. I’ve had several TikToks taken down for unknown reasons and the reasons listed are usually vague or wildly incorrect. For example, I used a fake animal prop and it was taken down for “violence” even though I made a disclaimer in the video stating it was a prop and no actual animals were harmed. Despite this, my appeal got rejected so I emailed customer service, which itself is a whole other headache to deal with. It took them WEEKS to respond and all they did was give me a generic response to click the appeal link, which I already told them that I did. It’s as if they didn’t read the actual email at all. Overall, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells now when I post content. It takes the joy out of it. TikTok, if you’re actually reading this, PLEASE fix this. You are literally hurting the community’s content creators.",Oh no. The moderation system. It’s broken!

My country is using your platform as a test similar to the over turning of roe vs wade to gain momentum on silencing the country and keep us from gathering and fighting back. I think that’s why most horrible laws have been passed statewide because it would rarely hit news in other areas of the country. My feeling with the history of how extremist tend to try to win is to eliminate communication within our country from one citizen to the other from state to state. That’s why they are going after you guys literally biggest and best communication app for speed of process but if they win they’ll be able to go after all. In that they will shut down total communication everywhere for Americans other than that our government will be able to crumble what’s left of our country.

It’s like having a tv, a book, a news paper, a studio, an audience, and a library all in one. Too bad this wasn’t around 50 years ago. It’s not that Tic Tok is more exiting than books, it’s that Tic Tok works as fast as my mind does….keeps me interested and never boring. We laugh we get sad, angry and even mad but never a dull moment.   I look forward to a cup of coffee and Tic Tok every morning. Usually and typically find the breaking stories several hours before the mainstream media and often times the news that they don’t or simply won’t report. I can’t think of any drawbacks to the contrary only that before posting a comment I learned that I have to chose my words strategically and methodically first, that there are consequences.  The wording and phrasing of a post is just as important symbolic of reality because it as if you are in front of a live audience and in fact are. Opinions and reactions to a post, a video, or a picture does warrant a reaction either way so it’s best to be honest and not hurtful, considerate and thoughtful and not mean and disrespectful.

2,2023-10-28 11:16:51,"Tiktok is great. I love that you can just scroll and take your mind off stuff. And it stays up to date. And one of my favorite parts is that you can scroll past ads. It’s not just some trap for money. However, I have some complaints. Firstly, I did not allow access to my contacts and it still very clearly uses them. It may be in the terms and conditions, but I find that very violating. Secondly, reports. The TikTok moderators never take into account the context of a comment when you report it. And often times, I will report something for very clearly violating something, and nothing happens. I have also had comments removed before, yet brought right back because they were wrong to remove it. The TikTok moderators do not do their job properly. Too many people get stuff removed for no reason, and too many people don’t get stuff removed when it should be. There needs to be an option to actually type a message when you appeal to plead your case. And there also needs to be a way to appeal a report when it doesn’t go through, because clearly someone doesn’t know what they are doing. I have seen someone get banned simply for existing, and yet I report a video for literally having M-rated content with blood and guts, and yet it has “no violations”. Same thing with harming animals. Or just harmful content that is meant to bring others down. This app either needs to remove reporting, or do their job. I am really getting upset with the reporting feature.",Tiktok

When joining this app, you will experience creative, honest, funny, and tons of different videos. You like the videos you like lost and it creates a for you page for you. But, it will never create a comment section for you. So, there will never ever be a comment section where everyone is nice to each other. You will experience hatred, hate speech, online cyber bullying, and more. I ask whoever is reading this because they’re scrolling for fun or they want to actually know what it is like to have the app. There is hatred, and it is social media. Every social media is full of it and might effect you in a way you won’t even realize. Tiktok is an amazing app, because it requires age restrictions to keep children safe, it requires a lot of safety so kids don’t get hurt. But, if you’re a mother looking at reviews to see if it’s safe for you child, then do not let them get it. Because you shouldn’t have to look through a review to see if a SOCIAL MEDIA app is good for them, because it is not. There are also videos on here that don’t belong on here.

It’s jus so fun and entertaining, so many dif kinda people on there si everything is hand made for every single person to find similar interest to their own and each account holder/tik tok user has their for you page, which are page(s) curated to each individuals interest etc; I must say the curation and accuracy of the algorithm of this app is right up their with Twitter; but I’d say even better/high than Twitter. Twitter gets pretty repetitive, that’s why I love tik tok; TikTok is always showing brand-new stuff all the time and doesn’t repeat interests!! Such as for; it doesn’t repeat anything you’ve liked or interacted with, even the ads are new every time but you will have your occasional “oh I’ve seen this one before” ad! AD; not video!! Video is always brand new never seen before, content is always updated and curated to you personally daily!! I love this app I could on & on;     Long sorry short; this app never misses; you’ve got your favorite personal interest; updated daily with a humongous variety; top tier comedy on this platform too; it’s the main social platform these days. 10/10",I spend 13 hours a day on this app

5,2022-12-14 03:06:41,I wish tiktok wouldn’t suppress my videos so mcun. Ppl report me and most are all restored I’m am trying to word my replies better but those restored violations are still counted and because of that I can’t get certain features and other things. I’m viewed as a mean or bad person when I’m not. So if they stopped counting restored content as a violation that would be better for so many. Also stop taking videos of ppl defending themselves against bullies down and then calling them the bully because that’s mean. Maybe if you let me get views and actually let me a creator I could make better content but you push my videos to people who hate me rather than my own followers or ppl who would be more interested in my content and then bo one likes anything I post because they send my stuff to old white racist men who don’t like me and that’s not fair either. We also need to stop putting automatic sounds on the filters that’s annoying! We need to be able to have harrassing commenters get punished rather than punishing the creators video! Punish the abuser ! The commenter the reporter!

Be aware of things going on around the world being so connected to so many people and I’m not afraid of anything personal that I haven’t chose to share getting breached or stolen from me I feel tick-tock is a secure app. I’ve seen so much good things come out of the TikTok app just the camaraderie the coming together of everyone if I’m having a very busy or stressful day this is my way to download I can get on here. Scroll through my search algorithm shows me the things I want to see I have the option for not saying something by saying not interested and it doesn’t show up on my feed which I love, unlike Facebook or meta-anytime somebody that I am connected to like somethings are showing up in my feed. It’s so annoying it’s nothing but ads anymore. TikTok is not TikTok is a happy place. It’s a place that you can just be yourself you can share what you’re feeling share the things you like the things you love and just be connected.

3,2023-03-17 21:04:49,"i’ve just downloaded tiktok again because it wouldn’t let me log in even though all my information was correct. i researched online to see what the problem with logging in was, and the top statement was to delete it, so i did. i tried doing that about 3 times in a row and it still kept saying “unable to authorize”. at this point, i just restart my phone and after that it logs me in my account. the problem now is that when i want to search, watch videos, create tiktoks, the app always says “no internet connection” or “no network connection” and i’m super annoyed by this because i’ve tried turning my phone on and off, i tried turning my WiFi on and off, i tried having my cellular WiFi on, and yet, no luck. i research about it more, and it says to delete the app or update it. i cant update it because it already is, so i delete the app. i tried over 3 times to log in, and i finally do. the super big problem is that i cant watch or do anything because of my “internet” causing this problem. although, my ipad has tiktok and is connected to the same account information, WiFi, and everything and it works great. i can search for this on tiktok fine, i can choose sounds fine, i can make tiktok’s fine, but on my iphone i cannot. anyone let me know if you have any tips or tricks i can do to solve this problem without me having to delete the app. :)",it’s okay.

4,2022-12-28 17:15:09,"I love tiktok bro, I spent everyday scrolling. But what annoys me sm. Is when i try to make a tiktok and it says access to camera and microphone, but when I go to settings I don’t have the camera or microphone to access it. So I can’t make videos/save videos. And as well is when I report something that has a girl actually breastfeeding with her shirt halfway down and you can see. They don’t take it down. They take down videos that are not against the community guidelines like harassment/nudity/etc. they don’t take that down they take down fun/no problem/not against anything/ etc. they need to get better community guidelines and more let’s say stricter, on videos. I got banned on my account for being underage. Although I know that’s against community guidelines your really worrying about kids underage more than videos that have nudity/harassment/gore/etc. I don’t think I’m your problem, plus I’m pretty sure you should change the age to at least 10+ What is great ———————- Is that tiktok never gets boring for me and I think the best decision was to make a “repost” button. I’ve reposted sm videos that I relate to. There’s not a lot that’s great, I just like watching videos like (GRWM’s) aka (get ready with me) videos, and story’s that people post, and many things. The videos are the main point of the app. And it’s great.",my review personally.
5,2023-01-11 08:40:28,The app could definitely use better customer support. If you own the right to audio material and it is flagged as copy written by mistake the audio will be removed and appealing the decision usually does not result in the mistake being corrected. Terms of service are often violated due to inexplicable mistakes on behalf of whatever algorithm TikTok uses to filter content. The app has a problem with illegal content that is harmful to minors surfacing and being widely shared before it is reported and taken down. There is a problem with the algorithm favoring White content creators over Black content creators. When you report racist material that targets African Americans it is usually not removed or addressed but if you make a video addressing aforementioned racist content as an African American content creator your response is often taken down due to violating the exact terms of service you are trying to bring attention to. Overall the app has potential but the racism on the platform and content that is dangerous to minors means that users need to be monitored by parents or guardians if they are not adults. Hopefully there will be a similar app with a much better algorithm that will surface in the near future and replace this one making TikTok obsolete.,Ok Social Media App for sharing video

3,2023-01-13 03:21:21,"So personally I think it’s a really great and functional app, but there are some downsides which is why it’s a 3 star review. My friends repost video that they relate to or that are funny, but some are really serious. They repost BAD mental health videos and just knowing your friends are going through something similar, putting on a smile when they’re really not okay. And getting exposed to that kind of content ruins your own mental health. Also seeing depressing videos make others people relate and get sucked into this whole other world where they thing their ugly, everyone hates them, their not good enough, basically no self love whatsoever. I personally have learned about new things that have harmed myself. For example eating disorders, I have a eating disorder now because of tiktok/social media because they make you belive you have to be skinny, have an hourglass body, have clear skin, smooth skin, pretty hair, EVERYTHING. I also would like to say I learned about sh which is self harm and now I have it because once you get exposed to it you tend to get sucked into wanting to do it, then a few seconds later boom I have a bunch of red marks in my arms, would buy clothes to fit in even when I hated wearing them. Tiktok made me hate the way I look. So yes it is toxic if you get pulled into this type of situation. But other then that it’s good!! You can learn life hacks, cooking and much more!!",Depends
4,2022-10-09 00:53:12,"My opinion on Roblox is is that it’s alright. Just needs to be fixed a bit, I really like Roblox because you can make a ton of new friends and it’s great, but some people can leak your address and find out where you live. That’s the dangerous thing about it. Something I don’t appreciate is that you can say “hi” or “hey” and still get banned, I don’t appreciate that. I once have said “ hello “ to a friend I have met online and got banned for 3 days. Roblox is a pretty good game but can also damage your vision. I’m not trying to act like a pick me but I assume you should wear glasses. I give Roblox 4 stars because of all of the issues. Another issue that probably all the robloxians hate is when Roblox will randomly have an issue, unexpectedly. You can be playing something and it will kick u out and u have to sign back into your account. This needs to be fixed. The good thing about Roblox is that it is very fun , and u can have a blast on this app. I really like Roblox but not the issues. Roblox is a very nice app and me and my friends will be on it a couple hours of the day, whenever we are bored. I also like that there are a ton of mini games to choose from. Games like royale high , adopt me , Bloxburg , put a finger down , the mimic , and ALOT more. I think you should download the app if you shouldn’t , but please.. be careful.",my opinion on Roblox..
3,2021-12-15 19:23:36,"I love TikTok; it is one of my favorite apps. However, TikTok randomly asked me to confirm my age, for some reason (which wouldn’t normally bother me because I had already confirmed it before),  so I confirmed my age. I put in my real date of birth (I’m 13 years old) and TikTok made my account private, made it to where people are unable to duet, stitch, or download my videos, and I can neither send nor receive messages. I completely understand that TikTok doesn’t want young children to get access to the app and post videos with their face or make unintelligent choices, but I have not done anything against TikTok’s policies or spread any negative energy. I am unable to send videos and messages to my friends or receive videos and messages from my friends. This has also happened to one of my old friends; someone reported him for being under the age limit (he is 13 years old) and TikTok private’s his account. I completely understand if you want people who are 13 years of age or younger to have privacy and not share personal information, but it doesn’t make sense that there are only some people (around 13 years old) that are being forced to have their accounts private’s when others do not also have to go through this.

4,2022-07-24 15:42:49,"Tiktok is a very famous app and has entertaining content that you can find on your fyp. There are some videos that aren’t appropriate for kids under the age of 11, but in order to fix this, you can restrict time limits and what videos they can see. If your kid is super addicted to tiktok, or is on the app 24/7, deleting the app or account is not the solution. This has happened to me once, on accident. I thought tiktok was deleted and I was really sad because tiktok was my favorite  app and I watched it a lot and made many videos on my account. Parents, don’t delete their accounts or apps. Don’t go farther then that. If you go on tiktok settings, you can set time limits and restrictions and you can set it to where your kid can see videos appropriate for THEIR age. Don’t scroll through your kids phone, even I they look worried or guilty that your scrolling on it, they are not always doing something bad in it or inappropriate things. Sometimes they are just nervous you’ll delete the app or account, or lose their online friendships. You can also download tiktok so you can see what your kid posts, and gain them a new follower ! Anyway, the tiktok app is amazing and you can make many friends on this app and express your feelings and post about your life, or maybe gaming!

I don’t even make offensive videos or anything I hate it when I reload my page my followers went down once or twice and there isn’t even a reason why I need to be unfollowed and it does honestly make me upset I really hope it’ll stop being a thing I like entertaining people but if they keep unfollowing it’ll take away confidence and there won’t be anything new on my page. :/ but otherwise fun to use I would recommend getting if you are bored but beware time flies by really fast when using so if you have somewhere to go I would be careful lol 😅.,Great app but I have a suggestion/issue

But over the past few months things have started to change, and not in a good way. TikTok has stopped put Lgbtq+ and comedy videos on the FYP. (People call this “shadow banning”) Instead of funny videos and videos that make me smile, I find myself feeling trapped on TikTok. I use TikTok to express myself and have a laugh once in a while, but now all I see is politics and inappropriate dancing. There are only a few good videos and everyone hates on them. I miss old TikTok, where if I was sad I could feel happy. If I was insecure, I would learn that I wasn't alone. And I know its great to spread awareness and share the news, but I’m always getting in arguments over who’s political views are correct. This app is mean’t for children and teens. It’s supposed teach you how to spread positivity. Most if the time I learn about dangers in the world faster than my parents. Most if the people on this app are too young to be into politics, including me. (I am 13) And yes, we should know whats going in the world, but not nearly half of the things shown on the FYP (For you page).

2,2022-09-26 06:04:28,"Tiktok Is disgusting they are allowing children to be exploited by their family. They are allowing a child to be groomed by the internet. And though they have nothing to do with it. They need to ban the accounts with children in them period. These children have no idea what their families are truly doing to them. As in the wren Eleanor situation, she has no idea what her mother is putting online. Shes just 3 years old and is having fun being filmed. She has no idea there are creeps on the internet saving her videos and doing who knows what with them. Just as the other kids on tiktok and instagram and really any kind of social media app, have no idea what the comments mean. There are ppl saying they are gonna kidnap a child. They are literally grooming children, and tiktok is allowing it. They love to ban just dancing videos (ones of adults), but when it comes to a child getting groomed by predators on the internet they are no where to be found?! It’s honestly disgusting these accounts are still up. And for any mother or father who runs across this, please i am begging you take your children off social media. Their lives need to be private until they are old enough to even understand what the concept of internet means, meaning a 6 year old is NOT old enough for the internet, any kid under 13 just shouldn't be on the internet.

5,2021-01-13 00:10:14,"I’ve had tik tok for over a year now and have racked up a good amount of accounts I follow. I hardly ever get notifications for the accounts I want to stay in touch with. I suggest making push notifications more customizable as in being able to get all new video notifications from certain accounts. This would also help content creators as well because it would allow their content to be seen more. We are all struggling in this pandemic and I feel this would be a great help for smaller creators in the creator fund. Another problem is how you enforce your rules. I’ve seen countless high follower count, young, fit women showing off more than what should be shown, as there are children on this app, while smaller creators are having their videos taken down with showing less than what the more popular creators are showing off. It is completely unfair and unjust. On one of the pages I follow, one of their videos was taken down for nudity, with showing an appropriate one-piece swimsuit, while there are other videos with much more shown off are still up. If you are going to be strict about the rules at least apply them to ALL creators and not just the smaller creators please.",Unfair enforcement of rules and notification suggestion

The reason they banned me was far from the truth as I do not drink and I do not smoke and I do not have any artillery. It seems that you were guilty until proven innocent and they really don’t respond to you whenever you submit anything to support and asked to know why or what happened so you know what it was. People can have a vendetta against you or they can feel threatened and then just report you and then you’re just shut down. This happened to me two Sundays ago and then it was removed and seeing that nothing was done on my part and then sure enough another week rolls around and on another Sunday the same thing happened and now it has taken days on the appeal. There needs to be a better process and I don’t think that it’s fair. I do think that TikTok is an excellent platform but they really need to work on customer service and personal interaction. I do agree with one review that I saw on here, where they said that they believe that if they don’t like you for whatever reason whether it is personal parents or whether you’re able to entertain the executives; or whether you’re able to bring in money, then this happens quite often until you are completely banned forever.

5,2023-09-15 02:37:18,"TikTok is a popular social media platform that allows users to create and share short videos. It has become a popular platform for car enthusiasts to showcase their cars and share their passion for all things automotive. However, TikTok can be both great and bad for the car community for several reasons. On the positive side, TikTok provides a platform for car enthusiasts to connect and share their love for cars. It allows them to showcase their cars, share tips and tricks, and learn from other enthusiasts. It also allows them to connect with a larger audience and gain exposure for their content. On the negative side, TikTok can also be a breeding ground for misinformation, dangerous stunts, and reckless driving. Some users may post videos of themselves driving recklessly or performing dangerous stunts, which can give the car community a bad reputation. Additionally, some users may spread false information about cars or car maintenance, which can be harmful to both cars and their owners. Overall, TikTok can be a great tool for connecting with other car enthusiasts and sharing your love for cars. However, it's important to use the platform responsibly and avoid dangerous stunts or spreading false information.",Why TikTok can be Good and Bad for the car community purposes!!

With plenty of opportunities to go down any rabbit hole you  receive well paced breaks from related content and even have moments when the app, get this, suggests you take a break and come back later. What started as an app teaching an entire generation how to express themselves in dance has turned into self help, political activism, crowd funding, mental health care, and an amazing fluid way to transfer ideas and of course the most amazing pet and animal videos that will take you on a well regulated entertainment journey. Thank you for your contributions to supporting the LGBTQIA and minority  communities via your app and for promoting a more worldly perspective. We are all on this one planet together and I hope Tik-Tok can help us all band together to protect it, educate ourselves, and share ourselves and our ideas with each other! Truly this is my favorite app on my phone and I encourage everyone to take advantage of this amazing algorithm! Find your people and follow your curiosities!","Catered education, entertainment, and activism"

Once I realized I was in a bad headspace and started working on myself as a person all together, I got on positive side of tiktok. So many down to earth people making content that not only helps me but others. So many comments “I needed this today” I know most people see tiktok as some dancing joking app but it genuinely has helped me feel less alone, gave me more ideas to further myself mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I feel more in touch with my true self than I ever have and I am honestly so grateful for this platform. The fact I am able to see every day people just like me talk about their vulnerable moments and that I am able to share content that I create. Yes it can be hard sometimes to get off the app because there is so much content that is wonderful to see but I believe there is an option to put a limit for yourself so you don’t spend too much of your day on here. I never thought I’d be writing a review for any app but I really do wanna put it out there this app is not just for jokes or dancing, although if you’re interested in that stuff I’m positive it’s on there for you. There’s something for everyone on Tiktok regardless of who you are.",Honestly helped my mental health

The people on it are amazing but the thing about it is that i’ve posten my kitten on it with a little happy song, and it gotten taken down for “child safety” it’s literally a kitten? i don’t understand it. I’ve seen literal naked women on this app and my videos get taken down because of a kitten?! seriously? i’ve also posted a tiktok here recently of me and my sister doing a transition video of us getting ready for the day and it has gotten taken down. Now my account is on a risk of getting permanently banned. This is so stupid, i really do not understand it. Other than that it’s an amazing app, but still fix that. I’ve sent an appeal but they said they couldn’t do anything about it and that i did break the community guidelines. Please stop banning my accounts because of this, i've seen so many worse things that or against minor safety but apparently a kitten is worse than a literal human organ? i do not understand it! please fix this.  It just happened again, it was a roblox story with my friends, it was taken down for minor safety and harassment and bullying. It was about how many words you have, seriously? fix this. I already have an account warning for stupid stuff like this.

4,2023-03-24 01:09:44,"Great platform to grow on. Their algorithm works well to reach audiences that want to follow and like your content but… their review process is very annoying. I do motorcycle content (@_OtherAdam_) safety content and funny skits but they seem to hate motorcycles and always flag my videos. My last video didn’t even have a reason, it just said community guidelines. I have tested their review process and I guess it depends on the person that gets to see judge your video and their views. For example it’s as if my videos often fall on the desk of a reviewer that hates motorcycles so they are just inclined to deamplify my video. So when I upload the same video twice. One will get removed because someone who reviewed it thought it was dangerous and the other one will go viral because someone reviewed it and didn’t feel it was dangerous. I’ve been dealing with this for 2 years on TikTok and have 230k followers so I’ve had time to come up with these conclusions. It has to be the only explanation since their customer service is non existent and you’re completely unable to get a hold of anyone regarding a issue. Other then that, it’s a great platform for going viral and most likely the best place to start if you want to be a content creator. TikTok please fix your review process. It’s terrible.",Great for content creators but….

I’m Almost Positive that the app is rigged to only push sexually explicit content, already famous people’s content, or people who have money to pay for their content to be pushed. The app is high school popularity in virtual form. There are so many deserving creators that go unseen on the app including me. I have practically worked two full time jobs trying to create original content that actually means something & constantly go unseen on the FYP, & cannot build my account! No matter how many tips & tricks you follow on this app you won’t go anywhere unless you can meet TikTok’s popularity standards! At this point it makes me wanna rid of the app all together & bring all my friends & family that joined because of my referral with me! Big accounts get bigger for doing nothing while small creators work their back sides off to wow people just to find out Tiktok is never gonna let any of your content go viral. Doesn’t matter how inspirational, kind, or creative it is! If you are drop dead beautiful, have money, or post half naked stuff. Tiktok will not push your content.

5,2023-08-31 13:22:27,"I discovered TikTok during quarantine…. At first I watched “funny videos” about puppies. But it very quickly became a tool to learn. Political events, BLM, covid etc. I feel like it was the first time I could understand and see what people were actually going through. It helped me navigate my emotions and figure out how I could contribute to the world… our country…. My neighbors. It’s taught me what truth looks like and how untruthful the powers that be are. My grout lines are immaculate, I fixed my dryer, learned a ton of new recipes,learned that I’m not the only one fascinated with zit popping. I watched soooo many people become their creative selves, become stronger, teach and most importantly grow. I believe that TikTok has created a true sense of community….at least the start of one. I’m still bothered that the mediators take down content from creators simply because haters report it. There has got to be a better way for you guys to see what true bullying is. Please don’t silence the people that are trying to make the world better, educate us and respectfully show us our truth….science based truth…. Historical truth…. Social truth. They are the ones that will make this world a better place for all of us…. And the earth. I am so thankful for the platform.❤️🌞🌎",People are amazing
5,2022-04-07 23:54:53,"First of all, if I worked for TikTok, I would actually take down videos that need to be taken down because you know how that one dog got ripped up by a pitbull and that took over a month to get taken down, yetMy cousin made a video with my brother doing a dance and on my cousins birthday a.k.a. March 9 the video got taken down after like eight months for grooming which she never did, my cousin was just doing a dance with my brother because they both like what the sound was and yet it was weird how almost every account got banned on March 9 that was not verified like my account with almost 1000 followers got banned for no reason, I was at like 960 followers, please fix this, also, whenever I updated my TikTok today, I thought it would give me like a tag people option but it didn’t. They changed my inbox, removed the favorites button and moved it with the other things like private vids, and liked vids. But they also switched the liked videos and private videos, and I honestly liked the stories and they got rid of it. In one of my captions, I said “TikTok can you please remove the inbox update but keep the stories because I like that?” But they did the complete opposite for me, please just fix this.","It’s good, but please fix this."

There’s lots of fun stuff, my mom is on the burlesque side of tiktok, she doesn’t go on it a lot but I think some things make her happy which makes me happy! So, there is one disappointing thing, that is live’s. You can’t go live unless your sixteen and have 1000 followers. And sometimes if you see someone’s profile which is live and you click on it, it has already ended. Also there are adds but you can scroll away from them so I don’t think they’re a big deal. There are people from all over the world and make lots of different types of content, it’s so easy to watch a lot of tiktok but you can’t sit at on your phone forever lol. It used to be a struggle to get off of tiktok because I was addicted but I’ve gotten over that struggle. Oh, there’s another thing I find annoying, every once in a while there will be a video made by tiktok and it’s things like “hold up, you’ve been scrolling for way to long” etc. and they can get annoying. That’s pretty much it. There’s emo tiktok there’s slime tiktok there’s gacha tiktok there’s plant tiktok there’s animal tiktok etc. HAVE FUN WATCHING IF YOU DECIDE TO GET TIKTOK!!!

It took it down for “minor safety” for this I understand. As I look young for my age. And you could not see my dad. But in the state I live in I am above age l have been shooting with my dad for about 2 years now. And have posted a few videos with me shooting. After this video got taken down I reposted it. And made another one with me shooting and that only. This was in December 2021. It has not been taken down since. Then 2 days ago I got I made another video with me and my friend. And got taken down for “minor safety” now both my friend and my dad suggested that it was due to the last 2 photos being in our bathing suits. And I agreed. Although I had zoomed in for that reason. To where it almost looks like a regular shirt or a tank top. I ended up getting temporarily  banned from posting. I then saw I could post again. And so I reposted the video. It got taken down again. I can’t post till tomorrow. I plan on reposting it. If it gets taken down again I’ll repost it again. I’m not going to take down my art because “TikTok says shoulders are not allowed” this isn’t elementary. So stop. I still enjoy TikTok but this is getting annoying.

5,2020-05-11 04:17:51,"I’ve had tik tok for about a year now, and it’s one of my favorite apps. It’s got some major issues though. First of all, I don’t have a post button. Where it says drafts, there is just one button, and that’s to add the video to your drafts. I have looked up videos on where it is, because I guess I just don’t have one. I have put a lot of work into making tik toks, but I can’t even post them. Please at least tell me why this is happening, or if I’m just being dumb, tell me. Second of all, whenever I try to search ANYTHING, literally anything, it says “sorry this feature is currently unavailable” and I can’t search up anything AT ALL! It’s just super anoying, again just tell me if I’m being dumb, but I don’t think I am. Also it’s the same thing for writing comments :/ Third of all, I DONT HAVE A “FOR YOU” PAGE!!! I enjoy watching tik toks that are related to the ones that I already enjoy. But I still, have looked through the entire app, but I don’t have a for you page. Please try and fix these issues, because I think that they ruin almost the entire experience for me.

We have some very nice people on here and lots of very rud ones also. I am on here to met people from all over and love to watch the different things such cooking, giving advice, make up, doing, hair, and just have fun. Their are plenty of things to watch so if you don’t like something that you see just scroll on by. That is what I can’t understand is why many people can’t understand that. My favorite thing to watch is the elderly people who are having dementia . It is sad but very interesting how their mind works and how the caregivers can handle them. They are so cute and blessed to have family to take care of them. I would like to thank the makers of TicTok for having this so we can have something to enjoy. I am a widower and I watch this instead of TV and get so much enjoyment out of it. Their a few things that seem a little unfair at times but I don’t know the whole story so I can’t know who is right or wrong. There are so very riska things on here but I just watch what I want and keep scrolling. Thanks again for giving us some entertainment that we can enjoy. Silent watcher",Thoughts
5,2022-04-30 20:41:41,"Tik tok is so authentic to the point that it started to make Instagram look bad. Everyone on Instagram always tries to be perfect and fit into society so they can be accepted and not feel alone or like a misfit. Whereas TikTok shows the REAL side. People looking however they looking. Saying whatever they feeling with out out it becoming an unsafe social environment(aka bullying etc). It’s a safe place for me to have fun laugh and share the joy with my family and friends. additionally it’s even more informative than any other social media platform for example at first I was a little confused about what is going on between Ukraine and Russia and Instagram mislead me into thinking America was going into war with Russia through memes, videos etc however I was able to learn more than I ever did through 30 second accurate and precise tik tok videos and even help my friends understand better and correct any misconceptions. I feel as though social media needs more of the real side to people instead of creating a false narrative of what we as regular human beings should abide by in order to be considered apart of the norm I can only speak for myself but I feel as though a lot of people would relate Peace and love",Tik tok is the best social media app period!!!
5,2023-03-18 20:09:52,"Tiktok is my number one reliance when I’m sad, happy, curious, or wanting to see what my friends are doing. Tiktok is so fun to use and I love making videos!! Tiktok has made me realize the good in everything! And there’s LOTS of content on tiktok, you can even choose what you watch! By adding a video to your favorites, you can save it and watch it again! Same for you liked videos! When you follow someone, you can see their videos! If you’ve made a video and don’t want to post it yet, or you want to edit it/save it for later/finish the video later on, you can save it to your drafts! The only person who can see it is you! If you don’t feel comfortable with everyone seeing your posts, you can set your account to private and only your followers can see your posts. You can make a profile picture, a bio to share a bit about yourself, and follow your friends! When you’re confused about a trend, you can click the search button and look it up! You can make audios, videos, live-streams, and more! I think tiktok is suitable for anyone above the age of 10, but that depends on parent options of course! Tiktok is a great app, and I think you’ll enjoy it too! GET TIKTOK!!! 💗🫶 thank you for everything, creators!",I love it!!!
4,2022-01-09 16:21:40,"Overall Tiktok is a really good app in general, however there are just some minor bugs that are pretty annoying. For example sometimes the audio just starts glitching and sounding staticky if you’re recording a video. Another thing is that recently my videos have been delayed after i post them. So i would assume it’s airpods delay however all my videos are delayed now and that’s including ones i posted months ago. Also there are a few things that could make the app better like, when you stitch a video instead of the audio not carrying over, you can have a choice on whether you want to continue it or not. I feel that it would be more efficient and a lot easier if you want to finish an old transition you posted or anything else you might need. I also personally liked the old drafts layout, but it’s fine as is. Another problem is when you’re watching a video and a text or something may be covered by a profile or the caption or anything else on the side, it’s hard to see or read anything so I feel there should be a feature where you can swipe to the left and all those buttons would go away sort of like how it is on a live stream. That’s all I have for now, but Tiktok is a really fun and enjoyable app.","Good app, but somethings could change"
1,2021-09-03 01:36:51,"I love this app. I think it’s a great way to connect with people of similar interests and create a unifying experience for everyone. I’ve always thought of the app as very easy to use and accessible to all people (especially with the captions added to the app), but the new update that caused the drafts button to shrink has been a big problem to many creators. People are fond of their privacy, yet they still love the idea of making videos. This leads to many creators making little cringy videos that they would then just save to their drafts to post later or to just save the sound. Many have that muscle memory of just automatically clicking the middle of the drafts button, but because of this new update, they have been accidentally posting their drafts. Not only is this a nuisance to mentally check every time that you are not posting a draft, but it can be very compromising to creators who need videos to be only saved in their drafts, away from their followers. These people would be minors or others who are uncomfortable with their face being public, Islamic women who like making videos with their hair but cannot show their hair to the public for religious reasons, and others who make videos for themselves and not for the public eye. This new update has caused a lot of frustration in the community and as an enjoyer of this app, I, and the whole community, would please like it if the drafts button was changed to its original size.",Drafts Button
1,2022-12-20 04:05:35,I loved this app until recently I ran into complications. One day I say a video and thought it was funny and shared it to my friends. Didn’t realize that none of them were being sent and it was because it was saying that every time I sent a message that it was violating the community guidelines. I even sent the letter “O” and told my girlfriend “I love you” and those were immediately taken down too. I did an appeal and they all came back and said it was a mistake. Then it would happen again. Today I went to log into TikTok bc for whatever reason I was logged out and it said that my account was permanently banned because of multiple violations of community guidelines. This is me coming back for being inactive for several days and just and apparently it banned me just for logging back into the app bc I wasn’t banned according to my girlfriend and my emails until I logged in again. Never have been banned before but yeah permaban right out of the get go and the best part is that it didn’t even give me the option to appeal just let me request to download my data whatever that means. So yeah years of memories down the drain bc of that dumb bug. Trash app. Unless I get my data back I’m never using it again because that’s a waste what’s to stop it from happening again anyways? I’m not the first and they didn’t get their accounts back either and apparently they never even got called back just ignored so yeah I’m done.,Trash app permanent ban for no reason
5,2023-11-09 05:08:26,"Hello TikTok, if you are reading this, here’s what you need to understand: I am a video editor, and I get to work with other people’s content. I understand that your new Creativity Fund constantly rejects my videos for being “unoriginal”, but what you need to understand is that while the content itself comes from other sources, I always give credit by using hashtags, my TikTok bio says that everything I make on the app has credit due to Dreamworks, music writers and more. The originality behind my TikTok’s are the ability to take something old and crafting it into something new; give a movie character a new personality and psychology, if not go deeper into it. Also, when the Creator Fund rejects my videos and appeals, not only are you taking away my ability to invest in higher quality video editing tools and software, rejecting every TikTok from the Creativity Fund will cause other TikTok creators to stop using the app, therefore, decreasing its popularity, attractiveness, and ultimately, its relevance. Do you want to stop paying me TikTok? I have a multitude of fans to inspire, as well as funds to make to support the app and other creators by all means.

It can be great entertainment and a great place to learn about different things and topics.  HOWEVER the biggest issue I have with this app is nudity. I have seen probably 20 videos where men had their penis in full view or slightly out of view in the last 2 months. And they do NOTHING about it. I’ve reported so many videos and they always say it “doesn’t violate guidelines” and you can’t get them to reconsider. You can’t write anything to help them know what the report is exactly about to help them see the issue, if it isn’t in full view right at the front of the video they don’t care. It’s honestly infuriating. It’s actually insane. They aren’t even hidden well, any person with eyes can see it but they just don’t care! It’s disgusting. The videos will get mass reported and called out for the nudity and nothing happens! They say this app is for 12+ and you can’t have an account if you aren’t at least 13 but that’s not fool proof. And even then 13, 14 and 15 year olds shouldn’t be seeing that. It’s disgusting. Their team is extremely lazy and terrible moderators. Don’t let your kids on here for their own safety.

Also, the people on Tik Tok are very toxic. It doesn’t do anything about videos or comments that are homophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist etc. The content can be extremely inappropriate, too but they do nothing about it. A lot of people on Tik Tok are bad examples. It has lots of perverts and there is a concerning amount of swearing on the app. A lot of kids watch Tik Tok and start swearing or doing inappropriate dances. There aren’t always trigger warnings on videos, either. I have seen some people traumatized bc of some Tik Tok with dead kids in it. There are videos of people doing inappropriate dances.

TikTok does none of this, and instead plugs its ears and says there’s no problem. A majority of the accounts that like my posts or bookmark my videos are fake porn accounts trying to steal private information, and in spite of making multiple emails to TikTok and filing over 100 reports towards these fake sex accounts, they have told me there’s nothing they can do about it. Furthermore there are constant issues with e-beggars who steal other people’s content begging for cash or straight up pirating movies and making money off of them, as well as multiple pornographic posts that have been reported and TikTok has insisted don’t violate their TOS. Even many of their ads are scams or spam as well, leading to fake sites pretending to “go out of buisness! We have 99% off sale on product!” or “We’re hiring!

TikTok has changed my generation so much, (hear me out I know this sounds like something your grandpa  would say), there’s just something wrong with all of us, I think it is because TikTok is so addictive.

The addiction of TikTok keeps you on your phone 24/7, when you are addicted to something you put it above all else, even other human beings, real people with feelings. I’m not making this up, I am seeing it happen to people I know, I’ve seen this generation get meaner and meaner everyday, it could be because of the mental illness trends or the selfishness the addictions push. And the terrible racist algorithm is another reason people are so upset on TikTok, POC creators are getting banned way more than white creators are, and POC creators barely get any reach.

I’m tired of having to do that and it makes me want to delete the app because I only ever use it for a minute or two at a time and I spend all of that just trying to get to the normal for you page. On top of that, if you make the mistake of opening the newer friends tab, it just switches between an “add contacts” pop up and a “your friends are on TikTok” pop up. There’s no way to exit out of it fully and you can’t even just go back to one of the other tabs, you have to fully exit the app which, again, almost always completely resets everything for no apparent reason. A lot of these issues are recent, but for the love of god please fix them because right now the app is borderline unusable.  Also the way it treats its creators with recent content violation rules is absolutely awful and tends to target already suppressed voices. I’ve seen countless completely fine videos be stripped because of the auto-report system, it’s a major issue. In general, there needs to be less content suppression for having more controversial themes, especially since the app markets itself as a way to stay up to date. You can’t really be up to date if TikTok is completely sugarcoating the news that it gives you.",Decent content but awful interface and creator issues recently
1,2022-06-10 11:12:05,"I’ve had this app for three years now, and one thing that remains consistent is how every update has made the app worse in one way or another. In one of the latest updates, the ability to search up videos was removed, and I just don’t see this benefitting anyone or anything. How does this make the app better? How is this improving the app? How can I feel comfortable updating this app when it’s highly probable I’ll end up regretting it, and the odds are NOT in my favor??   After discovering this feature was removed, I went to the App Store and saw that there was another update available. Thinking this would fix the issue and very poor choice on the devs’ behalf, I updated the app. Opened it and the format is completely ruined. There is now a seemingly pointless dislike button attached to each comment and ruining the formatting of the comments, the favorites button is now taking up an unnecessary amount of room on the screen, and there is a new “Friends” tab on the bottom of the screen that just isn’t useful.   What’s the point of any of this? Why add these useless and hindering features, and yet continue to take away the things that make the app more accessible, the things we truly need? As an avid user of Tik Tok, I am fed up. It hurts to see this happening, and I don’t know how much longer I can put up with it and use this app. I hope this message reaches the right person, and my voice (among many others) can be heard.",Poor updates
1,2021-02-18 21:48:22,"TikTok has TOS and community guidelines that only work if you are either making them money, or if you conform to what they want. Not only this they will make up bogus violations against certain people that are not even real violations of terms or guidelines. For example they will ban accounts of people just for eating. And worse than that they don’t always review stuff and when they do it’s just personal opinion on their part if they like it or not. Also they will suppress content creators like cosplayers or just ban their accounts all together for no reason. They also claim to have rules and stuff against bullying and harassment yet instead when someone comes to them about being bullied or harassed TikTok will punish the person being bullied by suppressing their account and making it so their videos don’t get seen as much rather than dealing with the actual bully, and they also will do this same suppression and content hiding on people who they don’t find attractive, people with disabilities, and people who they think are overweight. Some people don’t have these problems because TikTok just picks and chooses who to cause problems for. The list of problems goes on and on. People need to be aware that TikTok is a horrible app and is not user friendly to certain people just because it doesn’t like them. These problems need to be made public and need to be fixed.",This app is completely biased and treats certain types of content creators horribly
1,2023-09-29 02:49:12,"I downloaded TikTok about two weeks ago or less. I noticed after a day of having it that my profile or app may be broken. After I would close out the app and get back on later, all of the creators I followed and all of my liked/saved videos would disappear. Not only that, but when I first attempted to upload a profile pic and bio, I received an error message saying I reached my daily limit. I let it go and tried again for the next few of days but with no luck, I kept receiving the same message even after 24 hours. The only thing that succeeded and stayed were my email and phone verification. I became so frustrated with this app that I stop using it for the next couple of days. Tonight I decided to give it another shot, only to receive a message saying that I “violated guidelines” and my account is now banned….. How does any of this make sense? I couldn’t use this app for the most part so what were my violations? Was liking BTS & Christian content my violations????? My main reason on getting this app was to watch Jungkook’s TikTok’s and lives, but nooooo, apparently I can’t do that. There’s truly no point on making another account because it’ll probably get banned again for no valid reasons. So with that being said, to my fellow Army, if you happen to see this. Thank you so much for sharing JK’s & BTS content for the rest of us to watch outside of this horrendous app. I truly appreciate you all 💜 Apobangpo!",Banned for unknown reasons
3,2022-12-23 23:12:25,"The app is ok. Definitely has potential to be a great marketing tool EXCEPT for the fact that it upholds a racist infrastructure. White content creators often are allowed to be blatantly racist and spew *actual* racist propaganda and slurs while Black, Indigenous and other POC communities have to walk on egg shells just to keep their accounts from being flagged or banned. Also, the apps algorithm allows white creators to flourish while actively suppressing Black creators’ content. This creates a disparity when it comes to money to be made because more often Black CCs set the most popular trends and receive little to no recognition from the app or other non-Black, specifically white CCs—especially after the trend/sound has become viral. There is also the apps (those who work for/regulate) involvement in the conspiracy to suppress historical and currently relevant information. It does a great job at censorship. If it were not for the app taking constant punitive measures against anything Black and POC CCs make that doesnt directly uplift & support white supremacy and comfort, then this would be a cool place to be. Right now, theres a Black woman follow train trend happening. Not only are we seeing the vitriol from angry white women who are offended they werent centered in a Black space (shocker), we are also experiencing delays and outright deletion when requesting or accepting our Sisters. Do better Tik Tok!!",Well…
5,2021-08-06 06:41:38,"TikTok is a fun app to watch dancing, comedy, cooking, hacks and many more videos. I would 10/10 recommend getting it if you haven’t already. If you are a parent figuring out if your child should be able to get TikTok just know that some songs and some dances are a little inappropriate for the younger kids. If your child is 11+ I would say they will be fine. The app itself is organized very well, so you save videos and sounds to look at later. You are allowed to have a private or public account depending where n your comfort. A private account means that you have to send a request to follow the user. This also means that you have to follow the user in order to watch their videos. Having a public account means anybody can follow you and anybody can sit and scroll through your account. You can remove followers. When having a public account, your videos may also be on the for you page. The for you page is videos you can scroll through of content that is recommended for you based on what you like and save. This is how many videos go viral. So an overall rating on this app, 10/10 would recommended, it keeps you busy all day and there is a video out there that will make you laugh.",TiktOk
4,2021-10-29 00:43:41,"I recommend TikTok, here’s why. TikTok is a great place for socializing. Better than other apps, TikTok asks what you like then shows it on your fyp, you can also customize what creators and specific content is on your fyp by liking videos and following creators.  There are fun trends to follow, with cool filters as well! You can have 8 accounts in total and they won’t be connected to the others, (so if you want a secret account, no one will find you). You can favorite sounds and videos, comments, etc.    That was Tiktoks good features!      Now for the not so great ones. These are the reason TikTok got a 4/5 from me.        So, TikTok has something called community guidelines, to keep every young child on the app safe and just cyber bullying under control in general, but the thing is, these guidelines are commonly false. For example, I got banned on a account with over 1000 followers for bullying even though I was duetting myself saying I was improving. And dumb things get removed on TikTok, such as videos, accounts, and comments. But then there are some cases where someone is doing something so wrong and it doesn’t even get removed until it gets over 1000 reports. That’s messed up. Other than that, tiktok is a great place! I recommend it! Just watch out for those guidelines! 😬👍",GET TIKTOK

I currently work at “Sugonma’s Burgers” and I make $4 an hour. I was staying at the creepy old man’s house but he died of Sawcon so I have nowhere else to stay anymore. I couldn't take it anymore.

2,2023-09-19 03:38:07,"Tik-tok has undoubtedly been the most toxic and infuriating social media app I have ever used. Objectively speaking, the app itself is alright and has no identifiable flaws within its basic functioning. Contrarily, an extremely large portion of the users along with the content they put out makes viewing content tiring and frustrating. Whether or not the videos in my feed are influenced by the ‘algorithm’ is questionable. I am constantly being bombarded with extremely controversial viewpoints, none of which I am fond of, and am finding it almost impossible to eliminate this content from appearing. The ‘not interested’ button seems to have little to no impact on whether or not I see the content again and sometimes feels as if it has the opposite effect. The few times I’ve found success in adjusting the content in my feed I’ve had to dedicate an unreasonable amount of time immediately swiping past and posts I want to avoid. As time-consuming as this process is, I find that there is no delay whatsoever in reverting back to the old feed I try desperately to distance myself from. I’ve even went as far as creating a new account to try to avoid countless topics that I’m sick of hearing about. Within hours, regardless of my viewing habits, I am back to square one. I have used this app on and off for 3 years and have found that periodic breaks are extremely necessary.",Frustrating and tiring
1,2023-05-17 18:13:12,"I was really excited to start using TikTok about 2 weeks ago. As an app, I absolutely love it. I did prefer the older version of tiktok, without the “find relatable content” at the top of every tiktok and without your caption sliding upwards every time someone likes. But, as soon as I tried following ONE person, I wasn’t able to. It unfollows them as soon as I leave the page. I’ve researched this problem, and A LOT of users experience this. Sometimes it goes away, but after MONTHS.  I figured they might be verifying that I’m a real person for the first few days, but it’s been TWO WEEKS. I logged out, logged back in, created a whole new account (still didn’t work), cleared cache, updated the app, deleted other apps, uninstalled TikTok and installed it again, and reported a problem through the app TEN TIMES. Every time, it’s just an automated bot reply, saying that there was suspicious activity. I verified my email, checked my settings, yet still nothing.  This is incredibly frustrating, because I’ve never spammed anything in this account. There’s no way to reach any real people or agents so it’s just unfair. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to follow anyone ever, or if it’s going to go away and when. I genuinely enjoy TikTok, I think it’s the funniest app HANDS DOWN, and the comments are always the funniest. But, to not be able to follow other users is incredibly frustrating because there’s no email or phone number you can reach out to.",LET ME FOLLOW USERS
2,2022-10-18 19:43:25,"Very disappointing.. Once every 1-2 weeks the app will switch on its own to the newest update from the older version. Then I’ll have access to post Stories, Tiktok Now photos, and use other features but the moment I close the app- sometimes if I just switch apps for a moment all the new features disappear and the app reverts to a previous version. When that happens, I can’t see anything I created with those new features.. This issue has been going on for more than a year. I’ve asked for answers from Tiktok support, done all their basic troubleshooting, and sent them screenshots and videos of the issue. All I get back are the most irrelevant, unhelpful copy/paste responses from support staff that aren’t even trying to understand the problem.  It’s extremely disappointing to know that an app with virtually unlimited resources can’t manage escalating issues like these to the appropriate departments to get answers to users. Even if nobody knows why I’m having this issue, they could just say that. But the way they respond to user issues truly gives the feeling they’ve gotten so big they don’t care about every users experience. Aside from algorithm and censorship issues with creators getting videos taken down and accounts wrongfully banned, this is something Tiktok really needs to work on. The user experience is lacking.",Great concept- inconsistent access to features
2,2022-02-28 22:20:54,"Tiktok is a very great app that I like and I never hated it until now.

Today for no reason I uploaded a video showing the evolution of my pictures, after that i edited my bio and switched accounts. when trying to switch back to my main i couldn’t and it told me that I was permanently banned for violating the community guidelines. I couldn’t Appeal at all I wasn’t underage and I have never posted an rude or racist video that would have caused me to get banned, tiktok has not only banned me but they have also banned my friends for no reason. I just want to know why I was banned and if I can appeal.   that part of my review was in 2020. i am on my 4th account now because i was banned over and over again. they don’t tell you why, and just ban you when you have a height following. i just reached 3k after a year of trying to grow my account. i spent hours crying and figure out why i was banned and they told me it was because of minor safety. i’m 13 and i still get banned for that reason. they said that anyone under 13 is banned but im not. people over 13 just have certain limits. i give them this rating because if they way they treat their users.",I like tiktok but got randomly banned

4,2020-12-29 03:58:34,"Okay, here’s my review. This APP IS WONDERFUL. But there are some down sides to it. So, I deleted this app once but I wanted it back so I can use it on my spare time. So I just got it back and apparently I can’t get back into my old account. I saved all the data but the password doesn’t work. I’ve tried a bunch of times. It’s probably a bug. Anyways, my second “but” is that even if you don’t want an account and your trust trying out the app, don’t pull up the pop-up that says “SIGN UP” or “LOGIN IN”. I honestly don’t want an account for many reasons. Bullying, mean comments, inappropriate things, ext. At this time-period, you don’t have anywhere to be, or anything to do besides hang with your roommates (roommate), family members, or yourself. Trust me, it’s tough. But at this point social-media is our life now to figure out things and to learn more. (This probably has nothing to do but I’m trying to give ideas and my opinions). Sometimes I try to not open this app up because I don’t want to see the pop-up where it says to “SIGN IN” or to “LOGIN IN”. Please don’t get me wrong but this app is incredible because I use it on other devices. But this device I use daily needs this app! Thanks for letting me share my review.

Where every other app is attempting to force me as a user to do things their way (changing format to keep people on, forcing other users other than your friends into your Feed whether wanted or not, or were just becoming repetitive to me); with TikTok, within days, I was watching my favorites, along with suggestions for others; and the algorithm helped find exactly what I was looking for; all by scrolling or amount of time spent watching.

I enjoyed the content I was seeing , and it helped keep me entertained during the many months of being stuck bored at home. However, when life did start returning back to normal, my usage of the app didn’t decrease. I was stuck scrolling many times throughout the day, and by the time classes returned in-person, i would still find myself scrolling…even during class with an earbud in. i dealt with some personal issues during 2021 and my feed was beginning to change, relating more closely to what exactly was going on in my own life. i felt lonelier, sadder, and my attention span was becoming terrible- it was affecting how well i performed in school exams, how long i would spend  practicing music, and long films became harder to sit through. i felt engrossed with this addictive never-ending cycle of scrolling through short videos…and i decided to finally pull the plunge and straight up delete the app, and delete the THOUSANDS of videos saved to my camera roll, (which i never even re-watched in the first place), and i could almost instantly see an improvement in every aspect of my life. this app literally changed the way my brain worked for quite some time, and now i feel like a new person without it.

I didn’t care that much though, because I had other accounts and I used them more often. About a month ago my friends tiktok got banned, for no reason, along with her spam and her cousins account.

But I’ve tried to report for multiple reasons. Do I get listened to? No. Tiktok doesn’t even read the reports. I spend my time writing reports to keep the environment on tiktok safe. They will not listen to any of them so I will be posting on here my complaints instead. I have a few complaints regarding blocked accounts and adding new accounts. My account, 17._.Brook._.17 was blocked a few months ago. On that account I had countless memories and would’ve liked to keep some videos. Instead all of the videos were taken away and I couldn’t save any! I have made a new account but would still like to have the videos from my old one. Also I have been trying to add another account under the same phone number or email as mine but it will not let me make more than two accounts.

4,2019-07-05 20:57:49,"I enjoy this app a lot and all the thing that you have added is wonderful! The only problem is when you report someone, it doesn’t do much. I think that you should be able to report someone and they would not be able to go on with doing the same thing they did, though thankfully- more than one person has to report the user, but indeed I have an idea you could add! The person should be active on their account at least 3 days so the same person does not report them with different accounts they are making. I suggest this app for many people that should be at least 10, basically double digits due to multiple swears that are allowed on this app. Maybe more edit options like, example; Camera swinging from on direction to the original video. This app is definitely absolutely perfect for people who enjoy making videos for others to see and enjoy! Though maybe make accounts get to the for you page more since its uncommon people search up a hashtag and find your video. Though I absolutely can’t stand this app, it’s amazing! And for another suggestion you should definitely add, make notifications for people messaging you and not allow spam if that is already added to the app, I suggest this app for you if you are looking forward to getting it!

5,2023-05-11 01:37:54,"Like so many others, I talked crap about TikTok & how it was just “a silly dancing app for teens🙄”. One day I downloaded the app and made an account to watch my kid’s videos they made, and in less than 24 hours I was hooked. The algorithm is awesome, the community is awesome, it’s always there when I need a good laugh, and sharing TikTok’s with family has become a great bonding time, tbh. Now with the STEM related FYP having been added, it’s even better! Based on the amount of likes on some of the STEM videos it’s clear that the entire world enjoys “nerdier” videos, too. You learn something new every day on TikTok, and I think that above all else is my absolute favorite thing about it. If heaven forbid they ban TikTok, I will definitely not be going back to old social media like F📖, T🐦, S👻, or I 📸, they are worse than TikTok will ever be when it comes to invasion of privacy or promoting dangerous things to minors AND adults. As an American I cherish every ounce of my freedom, and I like my social media like I do my life, and that’s censorship free. If this rambling of a review doesn’t convince you to try TikTok for yourself then I don’t know what will. I do know that you’re missing out on something really cool if you don’t😎💖",TikTok is THE BEST social media app!
5,2021-09-10 19:53:44,"Hello, I’ve had tik tok sense 2018 and I have always loved it. But recently there have been a lot of updates mainly focusing on the drafts and the draft button and I just wanted to point out how much everyone hates it. The draft button went small and now the size is back to normal just because so many people complained about it. But now the drafts are weird. Just stop messing with the drafts it was good how it was before. Another thing, we can’t screen record drafts anymore? Whoever came up with that idea is obviously a very dumb person. Some people don’t like posting their tik toks and would rather screen record them to post in snapchat. Another thing I wanted to write about concerns the lives. I’m 15 and I like going live all the time, my lives however are always getting banned. You guys may be too old to realize this but a great majority of the tik tok population is under the age of 15, and it gets me so frustrated when I see a bunch of other lives with people doing way worse stuff than me not getting banned. It’s just not fair, instead of focusing on things that are actually bad going on in tik tok you guys are focusing on banning 15 year olds for joking around and going live.",Updates are bad
5,2023-02-14 06:10:25,I love tiktok …it’s my go to happy place when I’m sad So many funny vids on there. I can stay up all night long and watch tiktok. I’m also a Cindy ent creator and love it. Just wished tiktok would stand behind the creators more. We get a lot of hate when we are known and popular. Always getting reported for things that aren’t against guidelines. And being reported multiple times no matter you appeal is and they put it back up every time. They will delete your account for multiple reports and that is not fair at all. I feel they are a bit biased as well. What the young ones get away with us older ones do not. I’m on my third page and I do nothing wrong. I can help I’m so gorgeous..god made me this way. Otherwise i love the app I love all the wonderful people I’ve met from all over the world and friends I’ve made along the way. They have come along way with their filters and tools to edit. Great music to choose from and so much more. I would recommend Tiktok 100% Just be careful there are lots of scammers and hackers on the site. But that’s everywhere these days. And Tiktok please stand up for your creators!! If one’s been reported 100 times for having pedicures don’t delete the page lol makes no sense.,Love tiktok
4,2023-03-24 16:05:06,"There’s no denying how entertaining this app is. And if you’re just watching TikToks, not posting, this is probably going to be a 5-star experience for you. As a content creator, it’s been a bit different. I’m enjoying the success I’ve had in the short amount of time since I created my account, but I gotta say the auto-moderation is just awful. Nobody should ever have a ban enacted on them or a video automatically removed just because the mod AI picked up a no-no word without context, or because people who simply don’t like the content reported it instead of scrolling. And there’s no real way to talk to a human being if you’d like to discuss issues like this. I’d love to have actual humans deciding what happens to my content and my account. And I’d love the option to speak to an actual human when I need to hash out account-related issues. I mean, I like being here so I bend over backwards to try and meet community standards while still retaining the humor that brought followers to my account in the first place. But these auto-disciplinary things still happen, often for no really good reason, and that is super frustrating. Otherwise, it’s a really fun app and I like it. Obviously I’m still around. Just wish we could get this one aspect actually fixed.","4 stars for fun, but…"
5,2022-07-25 19:08:07,"Kicked out of my account after I put my birthday in. I’m 29 years old. I put my birthday in under my account info. It then said “you are 29 years old” I said yes. Then it said you weren’t eligible for an account when you created your account. This makes no sense, I was 27 or 28 when I made my account. It says the app is for 12 and older so I’m really confused as to what is going on, I was literally 12 in 2005 and tiktok did not exist then lol   Now everytime I try to get on tiktok a thing pops up that says I can get my videos emailed to me or choose to have tiktok delete them. I created a lot of memories on there, videos with my kids that I made so they could see one day when they are older, I don’t have a lot of followers but my account is still important to me. I also enjoy watching videos on tiktok I don’t want to have to start all over.   Just a warning to anyone don’t put your birthday in under your account , this definitely seems like a glitch or flaw in there system. I hope they can fix this so I can get back into my account. I contacted support twice but haven’t heard anything back yet , hoping some fixes this soon as I am really bored and would like to get on tiktok lol",Kicked out of my account
5,2023-10-26 04:48:16,"There were several pretty cool videos on Facebook that I realized were from TikTok so that’s when I decided to get on this app as well. Originally I thought it was ridiculous crap like dancing hospital workers….and it was, until I learned the secret. When you scroll past the inane nonsense and start searching for the juicy stuff, that’s what you start getting, all the juicy stuff that was forbidden on the other social media apps. It was so obvious to me why Washington DC was so adamant about censoring it and ultimately shutting it down, why? Because among other things it makes them look bad. Not through slander or defamation of character, no not at all. What it does is just shows us who they really are, all their ignorance and hypocrisy, the way they’re trying to keep us at odds while they commit crimes of epic proportion, lying and stealing from us. So many clips you wouldn’t normally search for of a boring and or political nature brought to you highlighting their favorite past time, self serving. And I’m not concerned about China spying on me, Zuckerberg already sold my information to the highest bidder. I go to TikTok as frequently as I go to telegram, the others are child’s play.","TikTok is not what they’re claiming, fortunately."
2,2022-06-06 00:45:12,"Recently on the app I came across an ad for pens, that were only a dollar. Since I want to have a nice pen for fun and stuff I decided to get one. What I did not realized that the scam company would automatically sign me up for a membership without my knowledge. I did cancel the member ship as soon as I found out about, I don’t even know if the pen will look like it did in the picture I saw. I’m just mad about the fact that TikTok let that ad on there website probably knowing that it was a scam, there had been a video posted 3 days after I saw the ad explaining that’s it’s a scam. I know TikTok may have not seen it yet but it still bugs me that TikTok could have prevented this scam and they didn’t. There are other ads similar to the one I clicked on, and those have been on there for awhile. If they are scams why isn’t TikTok doing anything about it, why are they ignoring this, what is wrong with them if they are ignoring it. I just don’t want to fall for anymore scams or have anyone else fall for. I hope TikTok just thoroughly check ads and their websites to make sure they are not scams before allowing them on the app, but I kinda doubt that they would do anything about this. Other then this I quite like enjoy the app, so I wouldn’t think trust most of the ads on TikTok anymore. There are some you can trust, but other then that don’t trust them yet.",TikTok supports ads that are scams
3,2022-05-18 21:22:56,"TikTok has easily become the most prolific social media app among all different demographics ranging from prepubescent to geriatric. It’s a wonderful platform to learn new information that is engaging and can even teach you new skills. I love that about this app but the one thing that I cannot and will not ever go along with is their censorship protocols and how their algorithm is trained to be extremely sensitive to look for keywords, phrases, names and places. TikTok will flag your video and remove it for a “community guidelines violation“, however, they failed to tell you which community guideline you have “violated“. Within the past year, TT updated their T&C to include a specific “community guideline“ that you “violated“. For a couple of months it was being implemented but now it has gone back to just a notification that your video was removed and one option to press one button, “appeal“. You cannot write or attach any supporting documents when appealing a video that supposedly “violated“ their community guidelines. Having easy access to information from all around the world is what average every day citizens want but that is not beneficial for the mainstream media so censorship is the “go to”. TikTok has a lot to work on regarding censorship even though they are a Chinese owned app.",Great app but needs serious improvements regarding censorship

I had already made a different account I was just trying log back into it because I had a lot of saved/favorited videos but then it logged me out of my other account which I had already started. I was very frustrated but I thought it was a bug so I just created a new account and went on with my day. A few days later, my friend gifted me her old account even though I had made a new one after that incident, and when I tried to log into that one, it logged me out of my account. I still thought this was a bug until one week ago. I had made 2 accounts on 2 different devices and instead of flipping through them because of notifications, I was gonna sign into one of the accounts using one of the devices.

1,2023-09-13 11:57:51,"For the context of this review, I’m going to state that I’ve just created an account on here and am getting started with using the app; or at least, I was. I followed a couple hashtags, tried liking some videos and following people so that my for you page was more custom to me, since that’s what the algorithm is for, right? Guess not.  After a long session of scrolling - to be fair it was probably way too much time on my part - I noticed that everyone I tried to follow was just… not in my list. As in, I wasn’t following anyone. Anybody I did try to follow was immediately removed from my list, and any videos I tried to like were no longer listed in my likes. After some googling I found out that TikTok apparently shadowbans you from using the app’s features if you like too many videos or follow too many people in a short period. I get that this is a feature created to prevent botting, but… why create an app that’s meant to keep you scrolling and watching, and customizes the content based what you like and who you follow, and then punishes it’s users for using these features? I followed so many cool people and now I can’t even figure out how to find them again because I don’t remember their usernames and their videos aren’t in my likes.  I spent way too much time on here anyways, so I guess this is a sign. Since my account is unusable I might as well just delete it.",Punishes people for using the app… in the way it was intended?
5,2022-10-21 13:52:33,"I’ve been on many platforms, but I have to say that TikTok’s algorithm is the most forgiving for someone with dyslexia or those of us that may have a learning disability. It’s not the fault of a computer program, but it’s hard to program a computer to not show favoritism or bias towards those with exceptional abilities. I’ve experienced great things with TikTok. Thank you! And may you have success too ❤️🦋🙌 TikTok representative: Please give clear guidelines on how to follow and Unfollow. Use positive reinforcement instead of negative reinforcement to teach people what the guidelines are. • How can a content creator follow back 1000 people that liked their video in one day? • How are creators supposed to only follow only 30 people an hour when trying to create content and still maintain a job that pays real money? Consequation is a full-time job with all the risk and only hope for a reward at the end of the tunnel. • why not create automatic tools in the creator portal, that are simplifies and makes it easier to use for a dyslexic content creator to handle these tasks, to free up more time so they can do what they do best spending that time on creating content.

When the pandemic started I really was bored and had nothing to do. Until I downloaded it, and I was having fun, it’s just brings so many memories with me. The community is literally so nice! But mind you not everyone is nice, which I wish it would stop but unfortunately can’t. If you are trying to look for an app that you can share your feelings, or even opinions, then this app is tods for you! I find so many relatable videos in my Fyp which helped me a lot when I was at my lowest. It made me realize a lot of other people are going through the same things as me, and that I’m not alone on this. TikTok can make friendships go, and come. At one point I had a friend, but I sadly moved until I got tiktok, and got in touch with her. Ever since then me and her have the best friendship, but I think that happened because whenever I sent her a relatable video our friendship grew stronger with trust.

1,2022-09-07 20:48:20,"Recently TikTok has been rolling out a lot of really bad updates to their app. The new inbox system is really confusing and unnecessary. I have to click through a few different tabs before I can see my notifications. It’s just tedious and confusing as the “activities” tab is not immediately obvious or easy to see. The other thing that irks me is that when I’m trying to preview a video in my drafts there is now an overlay over the video that is no longer collapsible. This doesn’t make any sense at all because the point of previewing a video is so you can see what it looks like on its own without all the buttons and overlays and what have you. Now there’s a big red “post” button that cuts off the bottom half of my video so I can’t even see what’s going on. Not only does it just not make sense to have a post button in a preview window, it’s just bad design. I’m convinced TikTok is just rolling out new updates that make the user experience more complicated instead of making it better and more enjoyable. There are numerous other problems like algorithm and report system they should focus on but they keep updating things that don’t need to be fixed and ultimately make the experience on the app harder and less fun. I hope they undo these unnecessary updates before people start leaving the app in favor of something like Instagram instead. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.",Please fix actual problems on the app

These features really bring down the experience for me. For one, Every other video is in another language. I’ve checked and redone my language settings, and I’ve clicked “not interested” for every one. I’m still somehow on Russian tok or Arabic. Another small thing is the favorites tab. All your favorited videos are in the same place with one problem. You can favorite thousands and have no way of finding that one video from a couple weeks ago. The app desperately needs organization. Favorites should have a sorting feature to group videos manually. That’s a feature I’ve been praying for over the last few years. An odd thing tiktok does is review the videos you post to “only visible to me” and deletes them. It isnt right to go through personal videos not meant for the public eye. Of course I don’t mean people post explicit or inappropriate videos there, but just like drafts, as long as the video is private like that, it shouldnt be reviewed by tiktok. There’s plenty more I could list off, but i believe those are the ones that bother me the most. I hope these issues will be taken seriously and solutions will be, at the very least, considered.",Good app but needs some fixes.
1,2021-08-30 15:06:23,"Ok so I've been using TikTok since 2018 and the system back then was great, Like I loved how everything was back then. But ever since like May 2021 the app's been doing some strange things like out of nowhere people are getting their MAIN accounts with like over 10K followers banned cause of some troll accounts. Also the app has been banning people off the LIVE access because they disobeyed the community guidelines like not being able to go LIVE because they're 15 and younger (In order to go live apparently is 16 with a license). Most of the app's community is 15 and younger and the app is letting all these sexual and violent people go live and then I go on the app some of the people I see going live are like 7 year old kids playing fortnite and is getting spat on by their viewers for the game they play ""it's not the person it's the game"". Also like last week out of nowhere I've been seeing people make meme videos about the drafts button being smaller than the post button, and me trying to avoid the update actually gets the update without manually doing it. I don't see the point in that and I don't know if the app wants to think that it's a good thing. No it's pushing buttons towards other creators that think the video they just recorded wasn't good so they have to draft it. Now I wish TikTok was banned in the U.S. one update I do have to give them though is the skip video option. anyways that's all I wanted to blabber about.",App problems
5,2023-01-28 18:57:11,"Amazing app for so many things. But beyond the obvious entertainment aspect of it, it gives the user a sense of community support. Feeling connected. supporting each other. Making friends. And also it gives the user tools to be able to create and design , as well as star in their own content that is seen by up to millions of people potentially. This app is also getting families a chance to be involved in something together. Especially in a time like 2020 (to current day) and quarantine happened, people moved 6 ft apart but because of TikTok we remained connected. And in the case of the family at home during quarantine, TikTok made a way for families to grow closer, engage in fun challenges and videos together. To learn more about each other, grow deeper connections and have fun together. Also, this app has helped people feeling down, alone, and possibly having self harm ideation, to find comfort in other on the platform. To find others who have felt or feel the same way. TikTok gives opportunities to those to find support or comfort or laughter in what it is they are seeking. I believe TikTok is amazing. I just began using a few weeks ago and I am amazed. I am also not being paid to say this.",Amazing

It feels like they’re mimicking Instagram “pay to play” for LIVE. I just noticed you can select who in your followers list to notify if you go LIVE instead of it being automatic. In order to do that you have to pay to advertise to your followers your going LIVE. It’s not pushing out to all my followers even though their notifications are on. (-1 star) Received community guideline violations without specifying what went against guidelines while on LIVE. No rhyme or reason other than possible mass reporting by spam accounts or trolls.

Be clear about why the account was temporarily banned and permanently banned. I don’t want to guess why; please tell what went against the guidelines in order to dispute it.

I’ve noticed that a lot of the creators on TickTock that are of African dissent get in trouble for bullying and other things you feel are a violation. If we respond as an African-American woman if we respond to someone bullying us who are you two criticize and chastise us four verbally handling someone who is being disrespectful willfully disrespectful to us.

5,2020-05-01 01:17:31,"Hi, first I just wanted to say that I absolutely LOVE TikTok and use the app on a daily basis, but I have noticed a few things that bother me. The first thing is when you are uploading a video, you can’t save videos,sounds,etc. This bugs me because there a several times I’m on the For You Page and I want to save a video or sound, but I can’t because I’m uploading a video, and then I will accidentally lose the video or sound and not be able to get it back. The next thing is I only ever see people with 1.5k or more likes on my For You Page, and I would appreciate it very much if it were easier for smaller accounts to get views, because most of the time the smaller accounts work just as hard as the larger ones. The last thing is about the comments. I wish people couldn’t limit the comment section to only ONE person. I understand if it is limited where only friends can comment or if nobody could comment, but I feel like limiting the comment section to only one person could make people feel not welcome and it is a big waste of a comment section.

3,2021-03-26 22:08:06,"When one of my videos gets posted I want people to enjoy them; not steal them!! I posted a video a while back and I accidentally tapped on the sound button for it (it's my original sound too) and I see another video so I tap on it and it's my video, my edit, that I worked for hours on, cropped and shared on someone else’s platform, when I went to report it for “intellectual property infringement” it won't work, I would like to report that some stole my edit and didn't give me credit or ask permission to post my edit let alone cropping out my watermark! And the button to report that problem won't work!! Because other people are seeing that video and they are telling the person who posted my edit cropped to look like theirs “wow this is so good”. I realized someone tagged me in the comments of that video and said the original belonged to me which was very nice to do, but the damage is already done because other people are going to think they worked hard on that edit when all they did was a 20-second crop.

Originally I didn’t want tiktok because it was so overrated, but with so many people using it I decided to give it a try, I have got to say, i made the right choice. I have a LOT of social media, and they don’t even compare. There is so much you can do on tiktok, and it’s actually very easy to get famous compared to other social media’s, because everyone has equal opportunities. Aside from that, when tiktok says trends start here, I used to just roll my eyes, but now I literally see that around 80% of the trends I see are based on tiktok. Anything can go viral there in less than an hour. About age limits, I wouldn’t recommend this app for anyone under 12, because it does have cursing, and content that is not appropriate for younger audiences, however, if it is a parent managed account, parents are able to control what their child watches, what their child posts, they can make the account private, so that only friends can see their posts, and they can even block curse words. If you are thinking about getting tiktok, whether you are a kid, teen, or parent, just do it, and if you don’t like what you see, you can always take it off.",Best app ever!
3,2021-05-31 20:40:18,"Now I’ll have to give it to TikTok it is a well made platform with many great creators and a bunch amazing qualities, but at the same time it feels like gambling of the media world. Now with most other platforms there is more choice in what you watch and consume but on TikTok there’s no filter, you watch what it points in front of you. And the vast majority of the creators, or should I say people who have posted some on TikTok, have no intentions of creating a actual good video. They are there to post something and get views. More then less the videos on TikTok are just to waist your time and try to pander to their audience and not make a good or worthwhile video. With that being said this goes nothing against the TikTok platform, I think TikTok was a great idea yet the publicity of it made it a place for people to search for stardom in their own way, since the bases of the TikTok platform can promote this single video that is bad quality with no reason to exist to million of views and likes. Now also TikTok is extremely addicting to a point where it is unhealthy. It’s strategy is for you when you are bored to open up and watch 1 or 2 videos but then you go down a long route of watching hundreds of videos and you spend hours of your life. My advice. Don’t get it, and watch a different platform. Thank you",Don’t waist your time
5,2021-09-27 22:06:20,"Hands down one of the best apps out there. This isn’t just a social media app, this is a place of laughter, hands to your mouth, tearing eyes, and so much more emotions with this app. TikTok is not like Snapchat or Facebook, it’s better. It’s so amazing to see how many people do so many great things. You can explore memes, people giving to the homeless, adult jokes, and so much more. You can comment on posts for millions to see. Like videos to show support. Follow to show love. Share to friends to help the creator grow. You can look at any topic you like including: music, art, wholesome, funny, memes, aviation, news, school subjects, and so much more. If you want to get away from people or the world for a little, this is the place to go. There are things strictly on this app only for kids 13+. But with the new TikTok policy, everyone is safe(including children). You can even chat privately with creators that follow you and you follow them. In order to do that you need to verify your account by giving your phone number. You can even make multiple accounts. TikTok is safe, fun, and engaging. All in all, TikTok is the go to app if your feeling lonely, sad, scared or more. Love you all! Thank you for reading.",Enjoyable. Interactive.
3,2022-06-04 20:46:33,"Hello! My name is Payton, today I am writing a review for one of my most favorite apps. There are so many good things about this app, the selections, the filters, the sounds, and the people you can meet on the app! You always want to keep on the good side of tiktok, with kind people and people who don’t expose their bodies for views. TikTok tries their best to ban people, but most of the time they end up banning the wrong people at the wrong time. TikTok makes multiple mistakes and has let me and others down, despite being my favorite app because of the things you can do on it, there truly is a bad side of TikTok. TikTok tends to have bugs here and there, but one of the bugs they have are so annoying. At a point in time, a few days ago, people couldn’t follow people back. This went on for 2-3 days. It didn’t fix until the next day because you could have 100 people following you, and you didn’t follow back at least 1 of them. Also , what is stupid is that they have sending messages too fast now. It’s annoying, what if it’s my best friend and we only text on tiktok ? Sometimes what TikTok does is actually annoying and makes me want to delete the app. Despite all of this, TikTok is a great app, but could use some improving. Thanks for reading this review, hope you have a great day! Chow !",A place to start
5,2020-05-14 07:16:20,"TikTok is a fun app for teens and some adults. There are cool trends to follow, fun hacks, DIYS, cooking/baking, technology, dance, etc. It has taught me a lot of very useful things, and has brought a lot of joy and entertainment. However, there are some cons to TikTok. First of all, it takes up a lot of your storage. I would suggest making it so the videos don’t save to your camera roll. Second of all, it takes up your battery very quickly. Third of all, it is very distracting and not so good to be on all day. Fourth of all, it is not included on the App Store for MacBooks which is frustrating because I need it considering my phone might break and I like to post daily or once every two days. Fifth of all there’s quite a bit of inappropriate content around the app, and Finally, there’s a ton of negativity circulating on the app. Which is shocking considering we are all isolated during a worldwide pandemic when we all need a lot of love and support. One thing I do like though is the other side of the people who stand up against the horrendous hate and negativity, and trust me I’ve seen horrendous things. So all of those cons just take away one star, because other than that, TikTok is super fun, and somewhat educational.",Overall
5,2019-03-08 19:29:08,"So I recently saw the age limit thing where you have log in your age and Tik Tok decides whether you are either too young or old enough to have the app. I had to log in my birthday and I turned 14 this year and was told that I was too young for the app. The age limit is said to be 12 and up but apparently 14 is under the age of twelve. Like, come on! I’m so frustrated about this. My account is being slowly deleted and I’m just standing by and watching my hard work, and effort go to waste. I really did enjoy this app and creating videos, but I can’t do so and keep going if I don’t have an account to proceed with. I had at least 920 something tik toks and now I’m up to 299, including loosing my hearts at which I had 6,200 something as well. Now I’m at 2,446 or around there last time I checked. This problem needs to be addressed cause I’m sick of it all ready want to have my account back to the way it was. I’ve seen other people talk about there friends being old enough to have the app and have their accounts deleted anyways. So if my account gets deleted for good I’m not gonna make another one and watch that one get deleted as well. I went to check if my old account was there and that one was gone too. PLEASE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM",BIG PROBLEM
1,2023-07-23 15:04:01,"Since downloading this app I have noticed several complaints of racism and racially bias related issues. Specifically from “people of color”. I’ve seen people of color’s content be torn down, have their profile blocked, and even banned. All of which I have not seen equal treatment for “people of non color” on this app for the exact same issues. To provide context, I recently reported 5 videos on this app. Videos to which the reason for having decided to report were all the same. “Pornography and nudity.” Two of the 5 videos that I reported were women wearing “see through” shirts and showing off their nude chest. These two of course were “people of non color”. The reporting results for both videos was listed as “no violations found”. Meanwhile, the other three videos I reported were women of color. These women were much more concealed, however, they also showed some form of “pornography or nudity”. The reporting results for those three videos were listed as “under investigation”. As a person of color I find this to be completely and totally unacceptable. It is something that I have witnessed being reported by large amounts of “people of color”. Absolutely no actions to correct this inequality has been taken on behalf of the app’s administrator. As a “person of color”, I would like to see fairness and equality be displayed at a higher level for all people across social media and their supporting apps.",Racially Biased App
5,2021-06-05 01:00:27,I hope TikTok dosent get taken down because honestly this app is amazing... it keeps me busy and it keeps me entertained! When I first downloaded this app I was 15!!! At first it was called musically ! I had at least 400 followers. And then TikTok was made! And I started watching people’s videos and I started making some of my own! I started to gain a lot of followers and I just loved doing TikToks it made me happy! I started to gain more when I got pregnant and having so many people follow my journey.... it was amazing to have so many people watch my belly grow and seeing my baby grow. It’s really touching ! I would love if this app stayed because we need it and we love having all this fun. I love all the TikTokers and it’s fun seeing them all make you cool dances for us to do. So I’m hoping this app stays because there’s a lot of us that want this app to stay for ever.... there’s just a bunch of memories on this app. We can’t take it away from them. And I would be so sad if all my videos and all our hard work went to waste! I have too many h videos of me and my belly growing and just watching all my viedos. And looking back. And see where I got here. So please don’t take away this app. We love it too much(:,Dear TikTok
3,2023-03-29 01:56:22,"as a teen myself, I basically grew up with musically which was such a fun and happy place for me because there were many kids that could relate with me and barely any adults (basically never had any inappropriate videos at all), but I feel like ever since tiktok came out, I just never liked it. I do have to say that it takes forever for tiktok to ban certain tiktoks spreading stuff such as misinformation, toxicity, being inappropriate etc. while a lot of the time, they spend their time banning accounts that have done little to nothing at all, and I find that really sad.   the second bit genuinely has nothing to do with tiktok itself, but more of its creators and people in tiktok. I’ve happen to notice that people have really changed through tiktok, mostly negatively. mental health issues have been a big thing on tiktok and many teens have been bullied through social media, specifically tiktok. I find tiktok to be such a toxic place that I just can’t bring myself to be on it. the people on this app need major help because a lot of them are basically just confined to their beds and do nothing but scroll through tiktoks and hating on creators for absolutely no reason.   I love the app and all, the concept of it is nice, but I extremely dislike the people who make tiktok the way it is today (toxic).",It’s okay…
5,2023-04-16 00:35:46,"TikTok is great when used by good people, for the right reasons, at the right time and for the right purpose. Ok, ban it from all government devices. Put strict protocols in place for government employees. Make the same protocols for corporately owned phones Make it a terminable offense if you want to, but what kind of information is China going to get from the average American on their personal phones? China made many of our phones and their components, you don’t think they’re already listening? The only things banning TikTok will do is cause many of us to lose the community we’ve have built over the last 3 years, stop us from seeing what’s really going on outside our 4 walls and small communities, stop us from sharing our stories and finding healing, stop people from finding community, stop the flow of accurate information to the people of our country, make FB & Twitter misinformation the main “news” sources and keep Joe Biden from getting elected again in 2024. You’re signing your own political career death warrant if you ban TikTok POTUS. If ever there was a Dark Brandon moment, it is now. We have to organize against fascism, and we need to do it now.",Banning TikTok Could Spell Doom If We Don’t Plan
4,2020-10-20 18:56:56,"I think TikTok is a great app to be honest! It has help me grow in all kinds of different ways and is kind of addicting in a good way. However, I feel like there is more that TikTok could do to improve the app. For example, you should be able to see who duets a video. I feel like it would be easier if we want to see other people’s reactions and want to share that as well. I also feel like we should be able to have a story that is up for 24 hours so we don’t have to make videos about something we want to share that is really not that important. In addition to that, we should be able to repost videos on our story as well. I saw a really REALLY good danganronpa edit and it was SUPER underrated but I couldn’t share it with anyone because when I duetted it, it only got 2 views in a day. Also, I think we should be able to go live (like a FaceTime on live) with other people. It would be super fun! We used to have a feature where we could pin comments, but we can’t do that anymore? Which is kind of disappointing, but if you can do that again, it would be great! We should also be able to pin videos incase someone is new to an account and people want to introduce themselves.   Anyway, I think that’s about all I wanted to share to help TikTok grow as a community and app.",Great App but...
5,2023-04-14 18:11:35,"TikTok is my go to app! I barely use any other social media platforms now. I have noticed they are constantly changing the algorithm and it can be brutal on views at times though. It can get discouraging when you put out regular content and your views are only 1% of your following. The math isn’t mathing. Regardless, I’ve never connected to an app the way I’ve connected to TikTok. My only complaint at this point is that certain stickers (GIFS) I use all the time are no longer available. I’m not sure if they took them down or as my account has grown, my access to certain tools has changed but it is very unfortunate because I was trying to keep a theme on my page and I’ve had to change it three times now because the stickers are gone. And they were basic stickers, just circles so doesn’t make sense. Even with those minor issues, it’s still a 5 star app for me! It’s just the perfect app for my personality. Plus, I’ve connected with so many new people that have the same interests. I’ve learned so much about my mental and physical health, training my dog, organizing, cooking, and so much more. Things I never would’ve known without the TikTok community.",It’s an addiction and I love it!
5,2022-05-19 23:38:27,"I used to not like TikTok that much, but the more I’ve used it the better it has gotten. Ever since I started posting, the app has overall been way more enjoyable. If you are a child who isn’t allowed to post, I bet you’ll still have fun on the app but honestly might not think its as entertaining. I’ve seen reviews that says in inappropriate- which is true in some ways. When you first get TikTok, the app doesn’t know you therefore it shows you extremely random videos. If you keep watching and follow a selection of creators you like, overtime TikTok will get used to you and show more things on your fyp that you want to see. I’ve seen people look through their following list because they hate their fyp, but i don’t see the need for that. obviously it takes time but if ur patient u could get to love ur for you page. I would recommend it but do follow the age recommendation. You could see dangerous/inappropriate stuff that you shouldn’t be exposed to at a young age. Overall though I love the app and basically never see anything bad. Lucky for me, when I got the app there weren’t any inappropriate trends at all so TikTok could get to know me without showing gross things.",Good
1,2022-06-18 03:57:58,"Why is no one talking abt how creepy this app is?? My FYP can read my literal mind. I think about a dance or song, and boom, there it it. The recent generation also was the attention span of a goldfish, and TikTok used it up like water. Their short videos mean nothing. You might find yourself scrolling mindlessly for hours. Nothing about this brings you joy. Every once and a while, you might find a good video. But seconds later, you’ll be scrolling once again. This app isn’t just a “waste of time” it is a life taker. Your days will be gobbled up with the endless amount of videos while you just scroll… scroll… scroll… maybe you’ll even end up liking a video or start following someone. But what does this even really mean? 38k followers? That might make you happy, but how long will this really last? Not to mention some of the people on this app, posting inappropriate content while some how TikTok guild lines skip over it; while other people trying to post things like informational videos get taken down or get given a warning. Why doesn’t TikTok want us to learn about the real world? Do they just expect us to go by their rules like we’re some kind of puppet? Why is TikTok the way it is? Thank you so much for reading, I sure did write a lot. And not to mention, TikTok knows everything. From what you do on any other app, website, or screen, to even your location.

5,2020-04-18 15:42:57,"i LOVE tik tok so much. i think i speak for most of the population when i say that basically all i do during quarantine is make and watch tik tok. however, there are a few suggestions that i have. my first would be that there should be a dislike button on videos. a lot of the time if there is a controversial video people have to like it to save it which gives that creator more clout. if you put a dislike button, it shows the creator how many people he/she truly upset. i understand why that could be a bad thing but maybe try it and take it away if it gets too bad? this next suggestion is one that i have thought of since i got the app. when i really like a video, want to recreate it, show it to my friends, watch later, etc. i put the video into my favorites. however, i now have so many videos in my favorites that i can’t even find the video i need at the time. for this issue, i wish so deeply that the favorites section had different folders that you could name. this way, when you go to put the video in your favorites it asks which folder, you could name a folder, watch later, dances, show to people, etc. tik tok is a great app but please please please take my last idea into consideration.",more to tik tok
4,2021-01-19 06:30:45,"Alright. Straight to the point. Tiktok popped up mid app to review and I pressed 4 stars to be realistic I guess. I love this app. I became a content creator and gained a massive family in the time of 9 months. I’ve never felt more loved, appreciated, and accepted for what I do. I found a place. I love inspiring kids, I love being looked at as a role model. The only reason it’s not a 5, is because of some safety issues. In the most respectful way, there’s been graphic content uploaded as videos, profile pics, or some even use this platform as a second option to a really bad mannered behavior. It’s scary for younger kids, or any one really but mainly for the kids. TikTok though has done ways to help prevent these things by making their guidelines more stricter and undergoing huge movements like the profile picture incident. Which is good of them. Tiktok is quick to react, let’s make this app safe! They are being more safer! This app should be kid friendly as well or friendly to anyone really! This new upcoming generation could be at risk if a huge used platform is letting these things out there. Yes I know it’s a worldwide use and not every little thing would be fix! That’s why it’s a 4 star rating with a good job to TikTok for being listeners and giving a space I can work with and be myself!",Eye opening ❤️

3,2021-05-31 12:44:05,"I hate Tiktok just as much as I love it. As a “creator”, you can have several viral videos and gain tens of thousands just from those but someone else can post videos that aren’t even there’s and involve no originality or just have a video that involves some kind of fight or drama and gain a hundred thousand in a day just for posting something involving a fight. It’s stupid. Also, the outcasts in society dictate who stays and who goes on this app. People get banned for a having opinions or beliefs contrary to what’s popular. Also, the community guidelines are a joke because of seen one celebrity post nothing but dildos as his content on an app for people 12+ and I reported his videos and they “didn’t break community guidelines”. How is the environment supposed to be safe for everyone if this app allows soft-core porn while limiting content creators who’ve done nothing wrong. It makes 0 sense. That needs to be remedied. Plus it also allows women to bully men without recourse or consequence but men get banned if they say one thing against a woman. It’s hypocrisy at its finest.   Besides that, I do love the videos that are funny, wholesome, or creative, and I’ve found a lot of good musicians on this app. I can only give it 3/5 stars because the cons just about even the scales with the pros; they almost tip the scales. But it is what it is",Love-Hate Relationship
3,2021-10-10 00:15:53,"So the app is really good it has a bunch of cool filters and funny videos you can make videos of you choice and promote your buissness if you have one and it makes it very easy to. Tik tok is good for like making small videos or like just doing it for fun even though they recently added the 3 minute feature, so we can do longer videos like story times and stuff. But some of the cons is that the app can be very toxic sometimes for example if you see a video where somebody had a disorder or is different for other it’s like you already know what the comments are going to be about and they are bullying the person and being really rude. that app used to be fun but now it’s like more of a toxic stage and there’s now a lot of gender wars and people making fun of each other and it’s not really that type of fun app you like to get on to escape reality anymore. And I really think the members need to some joe update that and figure something out because honestly a lot of people are not wanting to go in the app and delete it because  now you can easily get a bunch of hate for just making one simple dance video and everybody picks and chooses the smallest things about your video out and picks on you about it. And it’s really just not that type of fun app anymore.",It’s good but there’s a few cons

5,2023-06-09 08:42:49,"Everything seems to be working good. My only suggestion is to have more song choices that are 2+ or 3+ minutes long, and then in the window where you can search and browse songs, have them actually be located in the “2+” and “3+” categories, because I have actually found some longer song clips that are not located in the 2+ and 3+ categories. There is barely anything actually in those categories and half of those items are a minute or less, despite being in there. Also, from what i am gathering, there are tons of filters, effects…bells and whistles, but I can’t seem to find them. What i see are very short lists with mostly really dumb stuff i would never use, yet i see fun things being used in other peoples videos, but i cant find them.

I’m not married to just one set of people. Personally as a creator the direction as other apps such as Instagram…I’m no longer making an investment into because you are not getting seen by the people you follow or discovered by anyone new. Too much drama for me. Tiktok I do see it can sometimes place you in a box to only a certain type of viewers but at least they do try to push the video as much as it can go I believe.

COMMENT IF YOU WANT TO BE TAGGED IN IT” or something like “ OMG GUYS I JUST SAW THIS GIRL DO _______ TO HER _____THE LINK IS IN MY BIO”  and yes they do actually tag you or have the link in there bio and the one that they have the link in there bio usually leads to something bad on Twitter.

I noticed it only happens when, i do duets with someone who has a lot of transitions in it. But still, can you fix it, because i’m known for making in sync videos with my favorite creator Jayden Croes, and when i make them on sync it’s like my video will go ahead of his therefore messing the video up, and i keep redoing it but it still happens. next i would love you to add a feature were because i like doing duets with Jayden, he has videos were he records with no hands, and then sets the timers to a certain point for it to end. why, is it that if you want to do a duet with that person you can’t  hear were they stopped it at and the second they stopped the music at??? but if you don’t duet the video you can here the sound, and the second but if you duet the video you don’t??? i really hope you fix it because i really love making videos with him❤️ thank you.",Duet Glitches

That said, I have seen a decline in the short two years I’ve been a user and I will list them (some of them are annoyances and some are serious problems) and then explain: ads, poor pay for creators, content suppression and censorship, increasing number of violent and hateful comments and videos. The number of advertisements has increased dramatically; why can’t we ever get a break from being sold to? I feel like I’m in that episode of Black Mirror where you can’t turn away from the ads. Marginalized communities are having their content suppressed with certain topics they address being shown to less followers than others. On the flip side, videos promoting hate against marginalized communities, violence against anyone, and other concerning topics do not seem to experience this problem. Often, reports for clear community violations are ignored by TikTok. You need to lose the ads, pay your content creators fairly, uplift your creators making a space for their community while educating those outside it, and promote the creators that are not advocating for more oppression and conflict while making it clear that those who are will not be tolerated.",***** to most of the users
5,2023-11-03 06:18:28,"I love TikTok it helps me a lot with my mental health but I don’t like the fact that when we report people that are bullying others and then we get a message back saying that there was no violation found.. that’s so wrong too many people on here have suicidal thoughts and comments posted on their videos that are bullying towards them can emotionally hurt them and leave them to suicidal thoughts and were told to report these comments, but nothing is being done were told no violation and it clearly shows that these profiles are either fake or trolls but you guys are doing nothing we screenshot the comments to profiles, but you have nowhere for us to send you this information. Yes we can block him but then are we getting penalized for reporting and then you send them back to us saying no violation something needs to be done about this because calling someone or questioning if someone is on meth or do they have teeth is bullying but you’re saying it’s not and someone with mental issues and suicidal thoughts is very harmful to that so y’all need to see what yeah I can do to check your information better please.

3,2022-10-08 03:53:58,"I had problems with tiktok before, whether if I was a new feature I didn’t like, or something like that. That’s fine, although I don’t like changes unless it’s feature I wanted, I would just adjust to it. Something that I’m not fine with is my account getting PERMANENTLY BANNED being of “community guidelines” THAT I DIDN’T EVEN BREAK BECAUSE IT’S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO: I don’t comment on videos, I don’t post any videos, I just watch, like, and follow people on tiktok. I want my account back. This is really annoying and unacceptable since I have seen accounts that have went against these community guidelines but still being up (and most of them were about nsfw etc). The fact that they are so many of these accounts of tiktok yet you guys do nothing, and when you guys do it takes a good month unless a video about goes viral, but then you ban random people that haven’t done anything wrong. I have also noticed people that I follow, who posts normals things, and nothing that goes against community guidelines get ban. Please fix this immediately, tiktok is my #1 past time and before this my favorite and most used app like most of the people who uses this app. GIVE ME BACK MY ACCOUNT👹 I AM REALLY UPSET BOUT THIS I REFUSE TO LET THAT ACCOUNT JUST DISAPPEAR SINCE I HAD IT SINCE 2020 I HAVE EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT ISSUES",Account issues

Lots of people sexualize things, they are rude to other people like maybe body shaming or age shaming, which I completely understand that isn’t in your control but I’m just saying maybe look into that. The app is 12+ but SO SO many kids are on the app. Like, LITTLE kids. You guys need to be a little more aware of who’s joining your app. I cannot number the amount of inappropriate Tiktok I’ve seen. Now I’ve had the app since I was 8. And sadly, it changed me a lot. I’ve seen some things I didn’t need to see, learned about some things I didn’t need to know at the time. I know I’m not the only one, a lot of people say the same thing. Also, I’d like if you’d make it where people with under 1k followers can go live. I’ve had an acc with 5k+ but for whatever reason Tiktok glitched and logged me out, I was never able to log back in. I was super frustrated at the time! It takes time and hard work to even gain 100 followers. Also id like it if there was NOT a text limit. I hope you consider putting a-lot of deep thought into this review pretty soon, thanks!

3,2020-07-22 19:35:39,"Tiktok is a wonderful app. It’s takes up most of my day. It’s also probably the most entertaining thing I’ve ever been on. Although it does have some down falls. Like videos can be taken down for no reason, videos that clearly do have a reason to be taken down stay up. For example, I made a video doing a dance and my grandma came in and hugged me. Guess what it got taken down?! I was wearing pajamas and she was wearing a baggy shirt with joggers, so it wasn’t clothing related. Here’s where it’s weird bc that got taken down but videos showing inappropriate content gets to stay up. Another thing is that people get told to kill them selfs on a daily basis but they don’t get in trouble. People get body shamed and bullied on this app but nothing gets done about it. Randomly tiktoks get deleted for absolutely no reason. It’s like tiktok is picking and choosing. It’s not fair to the ones to follow the rules in this app and still get deleted. Also live shouldn’t be debated on how much followers you have. Tiktok is an app that everyone has grown to love but it’s not always a place for everyone bc of all the hate and picking and choosing. I love tiktok and thousands of others do too. So please take what I had to say into thought to make tiktok a place for everyone!                                 Thank you. 🙂",Please read!

I’ve seen so many people telling others to kill themselves which I find unacceptable. One of the worst things is I'm not an adult but even I notice whats going on in this app. People in fandoms have been told to die for being in that fandom. Theres little kids on this app even if they aren’t supposed to be they are and thats close to impossible to stop. Theres creators that are terrible influences and theres predictors on this app. People are being bullied, people are being terrible to each other.  We need this to stop people are joking about things that shouldn’t be messed with. Currently theres a trend that makes fun of autistic people which how is that even close to being okay? Why would someone think they can make fun of people? I know why its cause tiktok isn't being monitored, the only videos I see that get taken down aren’t even the ones that are doing harm to people.

1,2022-04-14 21:50:54,"This app is super addicting as a viewer. As for being a creator, it is very very irritating. Tiktok constantly shadow bans the creators just because haters report the video for total nonsense. They will ban you from Live just because viewers will report you over and over so that the other viewers will go to other people to rank higher.. I bought ads on purpose just to see who they are showing my content to and my content is intended for adults over 21 and they were showing my content to children 13-17 years old and won't give me a refund for the ads or say anything about it showing to them. No wonder I get shadow banned... It is not appropriate for children so yeah it should be reported but I should not be in trouble for it. This is a them problem with their algorithm and not my fault as I am not doing anything wrong. I bought ads and targeted them.. I had 6k views, 1k new followers and 1k likes. After the ad ended, it is now crickets because I'm either shadow banned or they are trying to get me to buy more ads by not giving me viewers in it anymore. All my new videos are not showing on FYP so I'm def shadow banned. The one I did was me dancing to country music fully clothed so it shouldn't be penalized. There's women on there almost naked and they don't do anything about it. They really need to hire better ppl to handle bans or use a human instead of a computer. We are all sick of it as creators..",Audio Issues
5,2023-10-18 02:45:23,"I absolutely love tik tok and maybe even too much to the point where it’s addicting and probably harmful for my mental health but who cares right when you’re having fun. The app is very enjoyable all around but one of the main directives for your expression is through reposts and favorites. They added a favorites collection board but I’d like to see something similar such as a profile collection board ( adding accounts to favorites). As in it would be wiser to only favorite an account that makes millions of edits rather then add those millions of edits individually for people to see. Simple features mean a lot to us as a consumer but maybe even a feature to change the algorithm by choice, allow us to get a fixed feed of endless similar videos or on the flip side by selecting an option of random and unfixed or focused videos to make the experience more appealing and not boring( there’s been times where my feed would just be guitarist video after video with no change of topic and simply made me turn of the tok and just read ).

2,2018-06-04 05:00:50,I love musically lots but the new update just makes me hate the app. When you try to type in your bio you have a maximum of 20 letters. It is horrible. Sometimes with my bio I tried to change it and it won’t let me I even counted my letters and numbers and it wasn’t even 20 sooo..Another thing is when your scrolling through your feed it goes “Your typing to fast slow down and take a break”. What is that supposed to mean. Transitions are hard to do with the new one and I’m confused with a lot of it. If you do update the app all of your privates go into Drafts. Which you can’t use the audio you saved to your privates anymore. There is an option where you can save your videos private but they fill up your whole feed like on the old musically you could just click on your privates and they would all be together under one thing. One thing that is really making me mad tho is I can’t see how many people have seen my musically when I click on it. It only shows the number of likes but who knows if those are the exact number of likes. The only way you can see how many views is on your main profile page. There is only one good thing about this new update the new filters but other than that that’s it. So for those of you thinking about getting the new update don’t get it. I love musically just want the old version back.,Love the app but I want the old Version back
5,2023-06-02 02:19:11,"Just a quick shoutout that a few years ago when I first got on here under a diff account Tik Tok quite truly changed my life. I was in a pretty isolated period with 3 young kids and a full time job. While it felt silly at first, I was inspired to learn the dances and and make some random videos and it helped me remember my fun goofy side. It was a breath of fresh air to see people being people, weird, authentic, wild, poorly dressed and with regular homes and surroundings. The other more presentable side is great for us all too, but we get enough of that and I felt like for the first time in forever I could express a creative side that had been dormant so long. It also taught me a lot about personality types, trauma, toxic relationships and traits, and healing which I unfortunately didn’t have a good understanding of until this app. I was inspired by the brave people who share the depths of their lives and  relationships, and are so vulnerable on here. This was helpful in so many ways including getting the courage to leave a rough marriage. As I move forward I hope I can help in some way like those who have unknowingly helped me. Thank you for this app. It’s everything ❤️",Tik Tok saved my life
3,2023-08-17 06:00:47,"I enjoy using the app, don’t get me wrong, but it goes through glitches a lot. With every update it gets, especially with ones that release or change a feature, the app is prone to have more glitches or errors or whatever you want to call them. I end up having to uninstall and then reinstall the app every couple of months or so to “fix” the problem, but then it’s like the updates I previously had are suddenly gone. A feature that enabled me to sort posts on users page by popular or latest is gone. The “friends” tab is now gone so instead of going “following/friends/for you” it’s “following/for you”. Previews on my uploads don’t work as intended so I can’t see the text I added onto said preview. It takes another few updates for the features to come back but I feel like this shouldn’t be an issue. The weirdest part is I have a second phone I use as a backup (an iPhone 6s) while I use this phone (an iPhone 11) and my iPhone 6s doesn’t go through any of these problems even though it runs on old software; it even handles the TikTok updates better than my 11 and gets the new features sooner my 11 too!

I'm an adult and it's my body. I've also seen many people on the app do the same, it just seems to be a problem when *certain* people do it. TikTok, you need to readjust your guidelines so that they ACTUALLY protect children on the app. There are people attacking and assaulting young children in comment sections, posts, duets, stitches, etc, and a nineteen year old in a crop top is where you draw the line.... Makes no sense. This is the UNsafest app ever based off of what I've seen take place on there, doesn't matter if there is great content. Please reconsider your priorities in these regards, this app is becoming less and less enjoyable to use and a greater platform for ACTUAL child abusers.

Down, take down the bullying accounts and sexual pages that have been up for years. I get that the app is meant for 14+ but there are still underage kids on the app that report videos for no reason, or simply because they got offended by the video that had a warning on it. Instead of taking down the video, actually veiw it, then take it down if it doesn't follow community guide lines. Don't take down a video just because a 6-9 yr. old reported it because their parents said not to watch it. They clearly got angry because their parents got on to them. I'm a cosplayer and am personally sick and tired of the youth on the app that report the lgbtq+, cosplay, gamer, etc. videos just because they did not like it.

4,2020-03-21 23:16:36,"TikTok is a great app, but I feel like it would be even better if viewers like me and everyone else who likes to from time to time watch some Tik Toks in a short period of time. For instance: you would like to show a friend something funny that you watched in a Tik Tok, ...unfortunately it was at the end of the video. So now you have to wait to show them the absolute comedy gold. At first that doesn’t seem so bad does it. Although  something to take in to consideration is that not everybody has time to watch all of a video just to get to the good part. That’s where my idea comes into play. I think that TikTok  should make a feature that includes fast forwarding and reversing the video to the exact point you want it at.     Otherwise I love this app. It is a way to be yourself and be creative in your own way. If you don’t want to do that, it’s also a good to pass time or just have a few laughs. Better yet it’s a way to find common ground with other people who like similar stuff that you do.     I personally like it a lot, but I know some don’t. And that’s ok with me.

1,2021-08-01 20:30:59,"Honestly after having the app for a little over a year and deleting it it wasn’t what I expected. The community is very toxic and made me feel unwanted where I just wanted to make videos and watch them. Also some creators were very “crossing the line” per se, ie ThatVeganTeacher (I don’t know her status anymore because of all this stuff going on) harassing, bullying and even comparing not being vegan as a sin, and racism and sexism. Also some people didn’t have to work very hard for their clout, ie Charli D’amelio would just dance and get 100million followers. While other people would be making videos they put their heart and soul into and get none, my point being that it’s algorithm is pretty messed up. There’s also a lot of clickbait videos with the whole “reality shifting” scandal and other various acts that try to get people to believe them even thought it’s completely fake. TikTok didn’t live up to what I thought it would be and it was toxic and messed up with people trying to get views but faking stuff. There have also been people pretending to be vampires and quite frankly i find that a bit weird. I understand that tiktok is a place to express yourself but some people make it unenjoyable with content like “dancing” or just stealing content.

As a Sonic the Hedgehogseries platformer, the characters run and jump to reach the end of a level while defeating enemy robots and collecting rings. In separate bonus stages, the player must run forward and collect rings to earn one of the Chaos Emerald shards. The game was developed by Aspect Co. and published by Sega for the Game Gear.

Despite their similar titles and coinciding releases, Sonic Blast and Sonic 3D Blast have little in common.

Additionally, I abandoned social media for years because of the negativity and horrible vibrations I could feel through my phone \ computer.  With TT I don’t feel that vibe and am learning a lot of great information, seeing fascinating art and designs, talented and hilarious people and I also see others collaborating and connecting with one another.    All in all TT is one of best social media platforms to choose if you are just starting out and wanting to build a following for personal or business reasons.  It makes you feel like you are a part of something, instead of feeling like you have to remain in the fringes.

4,2022-10-26 15:13:43,"Hi! I love your app but have several complaints. I get the fact that you want to protect those people under 16, but that should be a parental decision. You can always make it so that a parent controls what settings you are controlling right now, as people like my parents are also on TT and now can’t send me messages over it as you have “restricted these settings for your safety.” Instead, make that a parent’s choice and make it clear you aren’t liable for what happens with their choices! I know you probably won’t read this review, but there are many kids whose parents (like mine) would be totally fine with people I don’t follow commenting on my videos. Kids can be smart too. If they are bullied, they can tell their parents! It should not be the app’s decision to block things when the parents can always connect to the account and do that themselves! Just make it clear that you are not liable for a parent’s or child’s decisions on your app. Especially on something like privacy settings. That is the choice of the person whose account it is or their parents. Many apps with age restrictions approach it with the parents as the ones deciding those things instead of the app for reasons like these.","This app is good, but…"
5,2020-08-01 20:26:01,"i love this app so much it gives me something to do, it keeps me occupied, and overall so much fun to use. i think this app should stay and not get banned, this app lets u express ur creativity and gives u a chance to be famous. this app can help u with ur homework, give u ideas to make videos and overall have so much fun. the quality of this app is absolutely stunning. if we didn’t have this app i would be bored all day and have nothing to do, this app impacts so many young ppl, they can grow up to be influencers if this app stays, taking this app away with scar so many creators. there are many influencers who’s career revolves around this app will then be unemployed, those ppl include charli and dixie d’amelio, addison rae, avani, and all members of the hype house. this app can help show awareness for diseases and disability’s, and help grow a new company, this can also help sponsor people and products. i don’t think this app should go because this app make so many people happy and this app has been around for about 3 years and hasn’t given anyone trouble then so why it happening now? this app is one of the best ones i’ve ever seen before THIS APP SHOULD STAY!!!!!!!💗🥰💓😍🥵⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",best app ever⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,2019-02-10 01:10:06,"It’s really fun I’ve been on it for almost 1 year, there’s really inspiring creators on TikTok. But watch out for scammer profiles. But there some mean people too, but there’s people everywhere so. That’s basically it of what need to watch out for. I would highly recommend getting TikTok. It’s a really fun app. And also you have the option to turn off the comments or duet/react and you also can set your account to private or public. And make sure to report scammers if you see any it will really help TikTok fill with more safety and if you see people bully other people please report them too, it really helps TikToks positivity. So when you go to create your first TikTok you can choose all different sounds even make your own. Make to look at the trends to on there. There’s a new challenge everyday. There’s also filters and face filters that you can choose from too. You can also look at the “for you page” and the following page (only people you follow are on there). And if your account is private, people can send you follow requests you can either approve the follow request or disapprove the follow requests. My account is private I only accept the people I know. That’s basically a summary of the app.",Awesome
5,2023-03-26 07:24:49,"It took me a while to try out TikTok because I had heard negative stuff about it in the news and by people that judged it even though they had never tried it (like me).  But my sister convinced me to try it so thankfully I finally did! It took me a short time to get the algorithm to show me what I wanted but once it did it just got better at it and I can change it by consuming different content that interests me at the moment. It has been the best social media experience I’ve ever had. You don’t have to be someone special to get engagement or really connect like Twitter or Instagram. TikTok is a real community and I don’t feel like some lurking outcast there. Everyday I learn multiple amazing new things. My FYP has gardening, history, crafts, politics, economics, weather, world events, news not even covered by msm, music, cooking, and all the other things I’m interested in. It even has cute & funny animals, hilarious skits & comedy, and video lives of relaxing thunderstorms or beaches! The other SM apps left me with constant anxiety or just weren’t enjoyable. Now all of them are meh and I deleted them all. Thank you TikTok and TikTok creators! 🫶",Hands down the best SM app out there!
3,2023-05-10 23:33:04,"So this started about 4 months ago, when I noticed when I got followers, I lost some. To date I’ve lost about 4K followers. I contacted TikTok, they told me delete your cache, update the app, switch from using WiFI, but these don’t work. I post faith content and talks about the mind. Other faith creators aren’t losing followers. I thought it was the niche. They then told me it’s because of inauthentic followers which I don’t believe because then we would all be affected. I think this is another glitch of the the system like their many other glitches. I saw a faith creator who had about 1.6 million followers. TikTok deleted her account because she is underage. She’s actually in her late 30’s. She had to start over. Many people have experienced this. I have been to a live once where this guy (he has about 5 million followers) exposed their private parts. I reported the live and nothing happened. I wouldn’t have children on the app.  So TikTok has done much for me because it’s given me a platform that o post my content, but when you work hard and see follower’s dropping - what is that? I have emailed them Lenny of times and at this point it’s a bit responding to me. Please clean house TikTok. Please get developers who can fix the glitches on your platform.",Losing followers
5,2020-04-17 04:44:41,"However this may seem like a great app to dance to music but you don’t know it’s deeper than you think, tiktok like many other apps can see your location but tiktok takes it to even creepy ways. Tiktok is still running in the background taking information from your phone , it’s takes passwords and different sensitive information in your phone, even the drafts you don’t post are being send to a Secret Account in China leaving it easier for hackers to break in and take sensitive information in my opinion you shouldn’t download tiktok. This makes it harder for you to feel safe in your own home because tiktok is always watching you. And even before you make a video tiktok takes the video and scans your face and they find out who you are and takes that into a data base to secretly watch you which is the creepiest thing I heard all of my life time. Do you parents want to know that your children are being watching by some Middle Aged people taking pictures of your kids. This app also takes your ip Address leaving  you unsure of your safety in the place you are in. PLEASE DON’T PUT YOURSELF IN HARMS WAY TO MAKE A VIDEO PEOPLE!!!",TIKTOK ISN’T AS NICE AS IT SEEMS!!

1,2022-03-13 17:12:37,"I’ve been on this app since 2017. It’s definitely gone a long way from making dancing videos. For the most part I’ve enjoyed the app letting you socialize with different people and find a community where you belong but, it recently came to my attention that there are many cp profile accounts on the app. I knew there would be creeps as there are on any social media platform. Though it seems that there is this giant amount of accounts either called posting in private or some variation of that. On those accounts CHILDREN will post videos of themselves naked and/or doing inappropriate things to themselves on said videos. It is sickening knowing that, that is happening and has been happening for a while on this app. Someone had posted one of those videos on the account to Public which made its way to some peoples for you page. They reported it and it came back saying that nothing wrong was found on the video. A video of a child NAKED. Also reporting those accounts will come back as them not finding anything wrong. Tiktok has continuously been turning a blind eye to this incredibly disgusting ring of adults grooming children to post things that they don’t know will hurt them in the future. I urge you to not download the app and give Tiktok any kind of profit until they do something about the problems they have on this app.",The things they allow is disgusting
2,2021-10-14 15:45:36,"Used to think it was an amazing app, but people (especially small creators) have been getting banned for things that don’t apply to anything they’ve posted. Common “reasons” are adult or minor nudity when the creator was covered completely in all of their videos. Often the video that was wrongly taken down was months old, I’ve heard of people appealing it, getting the video back, but getting post banned anyway. It happens repeatedly until it’s to the point where you’d be better off just making a new account because you’re always post banned. It doesn’t help that it’s incredibly hard to get TikTok’s attention to get these issues fixed, even when you email them it’s obvious that you’re talking to a computer that doesn’t understand what you’re asking. This doesn’t even cover half of everything starting to go wrong with this app, just what I think is the biggest thing. Many creators have already left TikTok due to mainly this issue (shadowban is also a big contributor to people quitting) and many more continue to leave as this app proceeds to ignore these issues. Like I said, I used to love this app, but it gets more frustrating with each passing day as I see more and more of my favorite creators quit. It’s to the point where I’m considering deleting the app.",Unfair/no application of guidelines
3,2021-01-21 19:03:05,"I’d give this five stars but like every app there are a few flaws. For example the reporting system was designed to report children and not adults, I’ve seen adults get banned for minor safety. Personally I don’t get that since their not minors. Then there’s the new restrictions with minors, minors no longer can duet, comment, or stitch other  posts, meaning that if there was a Tiktoker that was a minor they no longer can show appreciation. Tiktok forced minors to go private for our “safety”, Tiktok if you cared for our safety you would’ve banned the adults that were showing off their private parts, let me say that again adults showing their privates. Adults also turned the app 18+ this app was designed for kids. Not adults, I’m not saying if your an adult you can’t have the app, but please remember there are children on the app. I’ve seen four year olds on there, please be mindful of this. Even with your “warning 18+” they are children filled with curiosity meaning that they will disregard that warning. I’ve seen 7-11 kids post “thirst traps” and comment on “thirst traps” I find this disgusting. That’s the parents fault but it’s also the reporting system because I’ve seen countless posts stay up after 10 people said they reported it. I thought  Tiktok as a safe place, I might’ve been wrong.",I wish I could have people duet me.
5,2020-03-17 19:31:19,"I love TikTok. I personally use TikTok to have something to do and talk about to my friends. It’s basically all we do, sometimes it gets out of control and we start making TikToks in the gym of our school during lunch when we can get suspended, but, you gotta do what you gotta do for TikTok. Usually people are really nice and supportive but people can get out of hand with shaming people as a joke when it’s really not funny at all, I’ve even caught myself hating it just comes and goes and I try to stay away from it. TikTok is my most used app and I have 30+ hours on it every week and idek how. There are a few things I would change and it would be that you can have more control who views your videos. I still want my friends and the public to be able to see my videos but also I want to be able to block a specific person from just one video instead of blocking them from my Paige. That would make you feel a lot more comfortable with posting because I’m not the most popular kid in my school and there are kids out there just trying to put you down for fun. But overall great app and I give it a whopping 5 stars even tho there are a few small problems. :)",Best social media platform ever!
5,2023-10-07 19:57:20,"Learned and still learning how much everyone has in common on this app. There is Cc a wide range of talents all over the world. Also people do not get as upset about shared information as most thought civilians would. The information helps tge world to stay on the same page as one accord without chaos in many ways. It’s therapeutic to express our likes, difference,and concerns quickly, and in in the same time frame. It’s informative and entertaining. Helps lots of people from all different walks of like through music dance, laughter, compassion, humanity, unity, and individuality. It’s not just some app to show off portraits. It’s a live phone communication with the world to know that we are all together in someway human ,alien, hybrid and more. It prepares us not to be afraid and to be comfortable about the inevitable past, present and future. I think the problem would have been if we were not educated in these things from education to dance there is a live home on TikTok for everyone .

It is a great place for me to cosplay, the community is friendly and supportive, and I can do more than take photos now when I’m in cosplay.  However, the past month and a half every time I try to post my videos go immediately “under review” and some stay that way. My videos don’t go against any guidelines. I even had videos taken down, and I would message asking why it was taken down, but no response. I would rewatch my taken down videos confused how it goes against community guidelines. Especially because I see similar content on my For You Page.  I recommend not harping people like this. Because it’s frustrating to me that I put hours into making TikToks only for them to never be seen because they are kept “under review”. I recommend not putting peoples videos “under review” until someone reports the video for going against guidelines. And send a reason why, that way it will be clearer on why the video was taken down and what the creator can avoid doing in their next TikTok video. I love TikTok and I want to keep using it, but if the server is still going to keep me from posting then I might leave.

4,2019-10-01 21:48:24,"This is a review that I am adding after being on the app for a long time. Ive made a lot of videos on my account, and Im always making videos that are fun to watch, but go along with the guidlines. However I think the report and appeal system is very bad. I recently made a video that was actually me doing a trend that is on tiktok for halloween. It's a trend where you pore candle wax in water, and it will create the first letter of the person youre gonna marry. I tell you this because its a silly harmless tiktok that everyone is doing. About 3 minutes of me posting the video, someone reported it, and it was immediatly taken down without question. I was given the option to appeal which I did because the video I made didnt go against any guidlines (which I made sure to read to see if I actually did something) about 3 more minutes go by, and I'm told the same message except now it says that my appeal was denied. I understand we need this stuff for actual offensive and dangerous content, but I feel the reporter has too much power which leaves the appealer to have almost no say in the matter whether their video was offensive or not. Please fix this, I've dealt with this before, and many other popular creaters have as well and we're all tired of it.",Couple things...
4,2019-09-20 03:37:22,"I have joined TikTok last year on my iPad Mini, posting videos everyday. Though I have some concerns that should be brought up. For starters, I am personally dissatisfied about having to wait an hour without liking anyone’s videos, It would be nice to like people’s videos without running into a problem. Another concern is not having enough fans to go “live”.   I had hopes to go live a few weeks after I started my account but I haven’t had any progression. Honestly, I think you would need just 100 followers to go live on the app. I also don’t like how TikTok puts all famous people on my “For you” page, I would like to give chances to smaller accounts, such as account with at least 30 followers. It would also be nice if there were less ads. When I first open TikTok on my phone, I see an ad about a trend or another app. I’m also scrolling through the For you page and see some random ad that doesn’t need to be on TikTok, although I know some ads promote movies. Another concern I have brought to attention is the use of cuss words. Cuss words have been found in almost all of the videos I watch. I am disappointed in the sound, and it gets to my head. Other than those concerns, I am proud to be apart of the TikTok community!",Love it but some problems..
4,2018-12-26 04:13:22,"Hello TikTok, I really love this app I have had it ever since it launched in 2014. I use it on a daily basis with my family and friends; but I really have been wanting to go live and say hi to all my followers! They mean the world to me and it is so sad that I can’t just talk to them and interact! Sadly, I have to have 1,000 followers which in my opinion is a little bit hard to get! I know that TikTok headquarters is really trying to improve this app and I think it is going great and you all fix all the bugs! I just think it is a little unfair that only the people with lots of followers get to go live and none of the people with a average amount get too. If you don’t want to drop the follower amount that is fine☺️! I just want to share my opinion! Another concern I have is the reporting! Half of my videos have been taken down because they are “violating community guidelines” but I strongly disagree, a video of me singing go t taken down! I really put effort into it! It made me really sad! It makes no sense because half naked girls are on there doing who knows what while I’m over here singing but their videos stay up for the world to see please fix this!

4,2018-11-13 10:52:00,"The app is very fun to use, especially for cosplay videos being that it is easier to meet other cosplayers on tiktok than ever before. The music is fun, and all in all it is supposed to be a FUN app. However, the app has become littered with 9 year olds that report every video and/or view content that they shouldn’t and that to me is just not okay. The people who work on TikTok seriously need to work more on how they monitor the app. A feature to make your profile only accessible to those 13 and older would be great ( its not like the app started out as a 13+ app or anything, no way, that’s not why there are 7 year olds using it now 🤦🏻‍♀️ ). That way, if a cosplayer wants to make a post with, say, SFX makeup that looks gory someone isn’t gonna come around and report it for no reason, because the profile is 13+. I dunno this feature and a lot of other features could be added to make the app better. Cyber bullying on tiktok is worse than ever right now, and I just hope that the app becomes a safe place to have fun again like it used to be. If you like music, messing with transitions, making new friends rather easily, etc. ...

Getting frustrated to create when views are so low for at least a month Please help our videos get out to be seen . We love it Still love it I wish the algorithm would push out our videos more We need help with our original and creative videos . All sit around 275 all day . This just doesn’t seem fair . We love creating We miss the old algorithm. Every video goes out at 200 views and stops . Well here we are into at least 5 months of struggling numbers between 200 and 300 views . It’s becoming really so frustrating that I know my girlfriend who is also on tik tok wants to quit . Please change the algorithm back Why oh why have you changed this platform so much . Every video is now Under 500 views where it used to be in the thousands for years . I don’t understand why you want us so frustrated for original work .  Please please go back to the way it was with the algorithm.,Hard to get view now … please help us who take the time to create
4,2021-01-03 06:20:38,I feel like the TikTok algorithm is really stupid because I've met a lot of cosplayers including my sister that have got banned from live just because they're a cosplayer. she has said many mutual of her have also gotten banned from live permanently without even going live in the first place. this needs to stop everybody is special and creative just because somebody's different I don't think you have a reason to be doing this. many cosplayers get bullied just because they do things differently than others I think we should share creativity and not disrespect others creativity. I'' very upset with the amount of hate on the TikTok app. this needs to stop now and I understand that many of you may not agree with what I'm saying but this does need to stop and we need to make a change. I don't understand that now to pay that certain accounts get just because they're not popular or don't do the same things as if people do. we are just showing that we are unique and creative I don't think that cosplayers or anybody that is having struggles with TikTok just because they're different should be going through this. again this needs to end and stop we need to be stopped we need to a better person. thank you if you read this.,TikTok

But I see MULTIPLE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE videos on lightly skimmed toned raced girls, white girls etc posting mad videos with there SH scars publicly showing yet their accounts were still up.

Through a lot of perseverance I surpassed the 1K and I’m about to hit 10K. It’s taken quite a lot of work and patience but my account is finally taking off. It seems that if you’re willing to do the work it pays off. I’ve many many incredible “creator’s” from all around the globe. You can put as little or as much time into as you want. It is important to know the guidelines. I know of other “creators” who lost their entire account. Just an update here. I am still having a difficult time understanding all the rules involved.

I love a lot of the features that this app provides, but one I’ve had issues with recently is my videos being taken down for incorrect reasons. Two of my videos were taken down for minor safety while their was no minors in my tik tok. I appealed both videos requesting they bed looked at again. They were reviewed and the videos stayed taken down. I barely showed myself without a shirt on, a shot of my from the shoulders up with no shirt and they took both videos down, one story and one video. And now I have two strikes on my account that will never go away because of their faulty security system. Thanks Tik Tok. I am really disappointed with this company and app. I would really love if the strikes were removed. I am 19 and was 19 in both videos I made, I don’t understand why they were taken down for minor safety. There are literally underage kids on this app who dance without their shirts on and their videos stay up, but my video gets taken down? How does that make sense? Other than this one minor inconvenience, this app has been great. I just wish that my account could be restored to its natural state.

The kids can’t control this app. It’s isn’t fair to the adults who are trying there best to do fun things, like makeup and OC’s and everything, and then get banned by some snotty kid because they just want to be stupid and report someone. For nudity or something like that. It’s nonsense for a kid to be on that. Create an app for kids who are under 18 to have fun but with parental controls. Yes tik tok is supposed to be fun. But why ruin other adults experience for the kids?! Also there should be a rule a strict rule, that says that kids under 18 are required to have parental guideline, and should have to show ID. or have there guardian show ID each time they create an account, or go into a live stream that for 18+ and over. It would make it way easier for everyone in the end to make it better. Adults just want to have fun too. But don’t want to get blamed for having fun in an 18+ only live. But overall tik tok is a great place.",Tik tok lives.

5,2020-12-19 19:17:36,"i genuinely really love tiktok and it’s without a doubt my most used app. i never get bored and the set up is amazing but me being someone who really enjoys having everything organized there’s a suggestion that i have (don’t take it too seriously). i always thought it would be cool if you could sort your favorited videos, sounds, effects, and hashtags into like folders. for example if there’s some type of pov story that has multiple parts that you enjoy, instead of it getting lost in your favorites, you can add a folder, title it whatever you want, and then add all of the videos in that series to it. another example is for sounds, maybe your a creator and you need sound ideas for your videos, when you find a sound that you want to use for a dance video, you can create a folder, title it whatever you want, and add all of the sounds you want to use for dancing videos. it’s just a cool idea i’ve had for a while and if you ever see this (probably not) please just take it into consideration (even though it won’t happen no need to give credit or write me back, i’m only 15 and it is just a general idea :)",I HAVE A SUGGESTION •please read•
1,2021-07-06 20:36:33,"So it won’t let me like any videos, and when it does a minute later it will say unstable network connection and then the video I liked no longer has the red heart on it. When I look at a profile it will show 0 for the following, followers, and likes. But Will let me see the normal followers/following/likes if I swipe out of the app but sometimes not even then. Won’t let me switch between accounts. I just updated the app. I’m not really sure what’s going on but can you please try to fix it? I just deleted it and redownloaded it to hope that maybe that would fix it. But now it won’t let me sign in. And I thought maybe my account got banned? But I haven’t done anything ban worthy I don’t believe. 9/10 I comment fyp on someone’s video. Recently asked for makeup tips. And suggested to someone that has a tattoo they don’t like that they could cover up( which I honestly meant like with another tattoo not physically cover up with clothing) but even if there was a reason for being banned tiktok would told me. Lately it’s been only occasionally that it tells me that it’s unstable network connection and I’d just have to close out and go back in to fix it but after I updated it it wouldn’t let me do anything. Just everything I did followed with unstable network connection. But my wifi is working fine. It’s even saying unstable network connection via login.",Bugs
1,2021-04-21 18:58:03,"This app bans people for just trying to protect one another and each other from the misogynistic, racist, transphobic, homophobic, ableist people on this app. They silence the ones trying to speak out and help and do nothing to the ones promoting hate and evil. They say they want to protect the kids but don’t ban the pedophiles and groomers on this app instead they ban sex workers who specifically say their content is for 18+ and who don’t actively go out and groom minors like many users on this app do. 12yr olds are showing their bodies and those vids stay up but ones of curvier women, black women, and sex workers get immediately taken down. This app allows animal abuse, ableists, sexists, racists, transphobes, homophobes, bodyshamers, pedophiles and groomers, etc speak their minds and don’t silence them til enough people have to report their accounts and posts but will immediately silence good creators who have no reports or bans from the community/followers/users by immediately taking their content down, banning their accounts without a legitimate reason or without a reason at all and never replies to the people saying to unban them let alone the creator who got banned to begin with. This app is trash now. They pretend they protect the kids on this app but really they just exploit them and silences any creators that are just trying to educate the youth or who are literally just trying to protect them from ACTUAL GROOMERS ON THIS APP.",Corrupt
5,2020-05-15 09:30:39,"In my personal opinion it’s a great app however there is a lot of hate and body shaming on this app. I’ve started to notice how people can say words they aren’t supposed to and then blame it on their age and they get a second chance but however when somebody looks like someone famous on the app the famous persons fans will come at the other person and they never let it go. I hate going to people’s comment sections to see all the hate and negativity there is.I absolutely hate going to comment sections and seeing all the body shaming from “You’ve gained weight” to “I can see your ribs” it’s like you can’t post a video of you eating something that “isn’t healthy” or wearing bathing suits without getting body shamed. I hate seeing people turn off their comments because of it, I hate seeing people stop posting because of the hate and I personally think it has got to stop because people start thinking that just because someone started spreading hate that they can do it and it just gradually becomes worse. If I wanted to I could list at least 7-8 people getting hated on or body shamed which I think is 7-8 too many!",Lots of hate and negativity
5,2023-11-01 02:21:47,"I have made so many friends and feel like I’m now part of so many distant communities because of this app! I have learned about different cultures and their people in ways I would have never been able to from my small part of North Carolina. You really feel like part of their families and become protective of the person brave enough to push that button and let the world into their lives! I most certainly can not thank TikTok enough for giving musicians a new way to grow, and create the attention they deserve! We the viewers have the power to change a person with a dream’s life and making us the labels eyes and ears for the first time, in a longtime. It’s allowed us to create a network of artists who can take an idea from Bedroom to Broadway, from recording at your friends house (Hey Travis) to millions of strangers listening to it on SirusXM/Radio and beyond! Heck I’ve been on Dr. Phil and Inside Edition because of it and am now writing with amazing musicians like Ben Miller all because of TikTok and as my career grows, so will my love for this platform and it’s importance to so many people like me.

5,2023-04-21 17:11:53,"I love TickTock, and I’m aware I did not spell that correctly but I also really love to support the ones that I have followed and I’m giving a 3 vs. a 5 because it is hugely disappointing to find out that pages are deleted and that very very helpful, encouraging, and now life-changing influencers and creatorsHave lost their ability to post they have been banned and they have had their entire page be taken down it not only affects their life and their income but it really affects their followers-   PRINCESSGLITTERHEAD helped me get through one of the scariest decisions of my life, she has supported and encouraged thousands of other girls and has now been recognized by news stations and more, I really hope all the teams working for and underneath TickTock can pay more attention to the thousands and thousands of people who take time to report others for no reason, ppl who participate in getting them banned, And that You can have more of a TRUE EYE versus a robot looking after these creators…. Thank you, and I really really do hope that my comment & this review is took into consideration. It is a major downfall across this platform.",To any one who this concerns….
5,2023-03-28 00:52:58,"TikTok is an amazing app that enables everyone to express themselves. It’s not only a great place to go when you seek entertainment, but it’s also a safe place to let your creativity run free. I’ve heard that TikTok may soon be banned, and I’m not sure how true this may be, but I really wanted to leave this message to show to whomever reads this that this app is changing lives. To explain further, TikTok isn’t just a playful app, it’s a job. For some, it’s their only job, the only way they get to eat 3 meals a day. Without this app, think about the amount of people that will be unemployed. Think about the number of people will lose their safe space, and the number of people who will lose their entertainment, their excitement. Also, TikTok is FULL of paid promotions, think about how many people working for different companies will decrease in sales, which in turn, decreases TikTok’s company sales as a result. I know I am just one person, and I am not even a spec on the Birds Eye view of the world, but I believe my voice can make a difference, as I am not ready to see my favorite app be no more. Thank you for seeing my perspective, Olivia",I love this app
5,2022-10-20 20:39:26,Tiktok is great but sometimes it’s not so I am going to say the good things and the bad one’s so the good thing is that you will have lots and lots of fun and you will be internetened and it’s not for little kids so please listen little kids and now for the bad things sometimes if little kids show there face they will get a lot of hate and every time you want to coment something long tiktok doesn’t alow you and sometimes adults that are inaproprit and they will send you things that are not good and start following you and now let me tell you how TikTok works so you make your account and if you are to young and all of your vídeos will be on private and if you don’t know what that mean no one will see it only you and to and if they are on private you will not be able to pick your own should and when you follow people there will be a thingy megingey where you press it and you will see you’re follower’s video’s and let me tell you what tiktok can change so when you type kill lady it will work but with kill boy it will not lêt you and if you want to watch another video you swipe up bye I hope you enjoy TikTok because I know I do✨🥰 bye,Tiktok is great
4,2022-07-19 19:39:04,"Well I am a 13 year old and my parents let me try out TikTok. At first, they were concerned about what’s on TikTok, but after me having it a few days, and of course, sending them a couple funny animal TikTok’s, they even got it themselves! There is a lot of diversity, and you can learn a lot from it. There is some inappropriate things on there but what I do, is I either scroll past the video or I press the button that says don’t show anything like this to me again. And, once I did that, it worked! Most of my friends have this app and I found some other students from my school and old school on it and connected with them! It’s really fun to make some new friends and connect with old ones. Some cool things I also found out is some hacks with math and that really helped me on my homework! I also found out how to become more organized and know where all of my stuff is! While it can be addictive, there are some posts that remind you that you may be scrolling for too long! But those are upon occasion. What I do, is before I sit down to watch TikTok I set a 15 minute reminder that I have to get up and do some things! I would really recommend this app for 12-16 year olds.",My Thoughts on TikTok
2,2021-10-26 04:21:41,"I tried to write a review the first time but it seems like I have to write it again since it is not being shown here. I like tik tok and all because it brings creativity and the good times together, but it has been so disappointing lately. First off, I try to report comments that are so completely violating community standards, such as transphobic comments saying trans people shouldn’t compete in sports because they’re not biologically that gender, and it has been found that it is not violating community standards when it is so clear that it is hateful and degrading!!! And they say this app is for kids! Hah! I’ve never seen such a toxic platform for people in my life! You literally have to fight to actually have tik tok see that it violates community standards, and you have to fight even harder to earn some decent respect! Secondly, there are good sides of tik tok and bad sides of tik tok. What??? Tik tok doesn’t even protect you from harassment from the bad side of tik tok if you ever got onto it (cough cough conservative and confederate and straight tik tok). There have been so many people deleting their accounts because they can’t keep up with all of the hate. Tik tok does nothing to protect their creators and viewers. This has been absolutely disappointing tik tok. Absolutely disappointing and disgusting. Something needs to change.",Tik tok is disappointing
1,2021-03-22 16:06:29,"So I’m just gonna get straight to the point. TikTok is unable maintain a consistent enforcement of its community guidelines since they will refuse to take down videos that are in clear violation of community guidelines (for example acts of violence against people and animals, derogatory speech, sexual exploit, etc) or when they do try to ‘enforce’ guidelines, the app takes down videos that do not violate them but are falsely reported by a mass of trolls or go against the app’s ‘agenda’. For the latter case, TikTok does not make an effort to work with creators who have been falsely accused and will shows little regard to have the video restored in most situations. It is quite intolerable that the app allows people to exploit its community guidelines just to harass or silence creators. Also, important social issues/injustices that people try to use their platform to call attention to have been silenced by TikTok through either limiting video’s showing in its algorithm or outright taking down the video with little explanation. Overall, I hope that TikTok is able to do something about this issue soon because for an app that is directed towards all ages, it not only puts people at risk, but displays a cruel injustice that can be simply resolved if the administrators of this app showed any sense of appreciation, decency, and care to the users and creators that make their app popular enough to yield a living and paycheck.",Funny and addicting but there are several issues
