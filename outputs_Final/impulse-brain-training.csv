After coming across Impulse, I figured I would give it a go. I have just completed the 30-day brain workout plan and feel real improvement now: it becomes easier for me to concentrate on the particular task and my working memory seems to be better as well. Not sure whether the same may be fully related to the use of this app, but I don’t care as long as I see results. I have bought the lifetime plan and consider this as a huge investment in my mental health. Planning to start a new workout but not sure whether to go for 30 or for 10 days. It would be great to see some recommendations after finishing the 30-day plan. Also, I enjoy solving brain-teasers a lot. Just a small suggestion here - would be really interesting to see how other players answered to brain-teasers. The only thing I wish this app have is more training areas, like creativity, brain speed, etc. Also would appreciate more games and exercises (still, worth to mention that the developer adds new content regularly). So, it’s a legit app and thank you for creating it.",The best brain training app ever!
5,2022-09-04 02:23:27,"Thanks to this app I now know  personality type and have been more of myself.  Knowing how i am on a scientific scale has helped me narrow down on my strengths and weaknesses and has since improved my ability to connect with my family, friends and even in my marriage. Everyone I know has taken the personality test and has inevitably had the “Ahah” moment. Upon sharing with others we all say” well that makes sense. “ This app has fantastic games that are challenging, fun and really get the brain juices flowing as they get harder. I really like the diversity in games and the fact that they all challenge in different important skills. My favorite are the ones where you have to put a box together in your mind and be able to rotate it mentally to see all sides in order to be able to answer correctly. Another good one is the math challenge. Frankly for anyone like me or otherwise with the desire to see the world from multiple perspectives and solve problems with practical yet unconventional methods this is a great app to get short form challenges to stimulate the mind.",The best app for a cognitive boost
5,2023-01-23 21:04:03,"I don't exactly pay for anything on the app store considering I feel the need that I don't have to. It's hard finding good and productive apps to help me succeed mentally and keep me on the right track, most of them are in-app purchases and you can only get so far before you can't do anything else without paying. Impulse is a good app for letting you use the app for free for however long and you can pay for more options if you feel free to. There are different training exercises that focus on different parts of your brain, it will also show how you did after the game.   The app gives different games everyday so even if you complete all of the games you can play more the next day and repeat. The app helps me most with memory since I can't remember a lot of things, it builds strength to the brain and its very beneficial. The app keeps me from getting bored and it's educational, kind of like when your a kid and you don't realize the educational games are helping you learn since your having fun in the process.",Impulse is a good app
3,2023-07-08 22:55:06,"So I’m fine with ads. Shoving them down my throat does absolutely nothing to encourage me to pay. Lol instead I don’t pay just out of spite. But when you show a questionable ad that only got worse once I tried reporting it… that’s when there’s a problem. Especially since I’m good at certain games and after every level there’s an ad. Which is fine.. but not when it’s showing a woman bending over with her behind arched up as high as it can go so that it’s eye level with a dude basically sniffing her snatch.. If I wanted to see that all that… I’d go watch porn on a platform made for porn. Not an app that’s rated ages 4+ with no way to report such ads. Obviously it’s not straight up porn but it’s so implied that it looks like you’re watching porn. Fortunately I found a loophole to skip all ads. If you add a report feature that will allow the user to stop seeing ads from a specific company/developer (because the developers make several different ads), then I’ll go ahead and tell you how anyone can skip the ads, without violating any terms and conditions.  Edit: I’m not turning on personalized ads to change what ads I get.",Stop showing porn

I’ve only had this app for a short period of time but I can already say I enjoy it so much. I haven’t been in school for years, since then I’ve been working full time but I always felt the need to keep my brain active and this app does just that. There’s many different games, puzzles, quizzes, etc to choose from and the best part is that they keep track of your progress throughout every different criteria. An example of a test I took was the Personality test and let’s just say after I learned my personality type I realized a lot about myself . I’m not saying the tests are 100% accurate but for me at least I benefited from finding out. I even did my own research on the personality type impulse gave me and it was nearly spot on for the type of person I know I am personally. Definitely check out this it. Btw there are ads but you can skip them, I find them Annoying so I’ll probably end up subscribing for no ads.",Get Great!!!
5,2022-01-01 16:47:13,"I saw this being advertised on Instagram and had been in the mood to get back into brain training. I truly believe everyone should have a brain training app, but this one beats them all. I’ve used the competitors BAXK in the past when I was in high school, now that I’m older, I can say this one has a more in-depth method of training and the games are really addicting. So much so I don’t want to do the recommended games, I want to play them all! But strict habits are good long term so I keep reserved, haha. Anyhow, they have different areas of brain training. You have your daily, then you have certain sections, I.e: Memory, Mental Math, etc. I got the 50% lifetime and honestly best money I’ve spent. If you want to sharpen focus, mental math, or even just feel like you’re not as ‘sharp’ as you used to be, you need to get this app and the subscription to follow. IQ tests on here and that’s something I’ve never seen those other apps have. Grateful for discovering this organization. I don’t even write reviews but this is one that had to be written.",Simply amazing.
4,2023-02-20 13:40:16,"Since I’ve added this to my daily routine I’ve honestly felt more motivated and have been doing well with thinking on my feet, which I am very grateful for. However, in the app they bombard you with deals off the premium subscription, they give you up to “96% off!!” Claiming it’ll only be there for a while, which isn’t really true. It doesn’t really affect gameplay though because you can still play some games, and you can complete your daily challenges without premium. My big issue is the tests that they have. Some include trauma response tests, IQ tests, etc. I wanted to do one, so I took the time to complete the test, and then only afterword was I told that I needed premium to see my answers… now I’m not here to beg to make the app totally free, but at least state a somewhere clearly that you need premium to unlock your answers. Or just don’t allow people to take the test unless they have premium. Anyway, that’s pretty much the only thing I have against this game, and all in all it’s been a great addition to my daily routine!!! Thanks!!!","It’s pretty good, just not 100% upfront."
5,2020-01-13 07:51:34,"I don’t usually write reviews, but in this case, I decided to make an exception. So glad I came across this app a few weeks ago! Thanks to it I finally realized how poor my math skills are... But the thing is they were not like this all the time! Back at school, I was really good at math, not the best in the class, but really good! And look at what happened... I avoided doing some simple math on my own, thinking it would save me some time (or maybe I was just lazy), and as a result, having faced the tasks in Impulse math category, I saw how big my problem is. Huge, actually. The tasks and the games are not that difficult, they really aren’t. And back in the day, they would be a piece of cake for me. And now it feels like starting all over... But the good thing is that doing it with the app helps! I’ve been getting better and hope for more results!  My only suggestion would be to include more games to the Language category, just like Math it seems really useful. Oh, and the math lessons! They’re amazing! But it took me time to find them. Thank you!!!",Love this app!
4,2021-11-15 05:06:14,"So far I have played the game for two days and I like the fact of being challenged . and not knowing what to expect next. This game so far seems to give me a challenge based off of things that we have to deal with every day in daily life issues. Whether those things are good things or bad things, things that you have to ponder on etc. it challenged you and took you out of your zone that you may have been in at that moment. I’m looking forward to learning new things expanding my brain span ,and being challenged daily, because what I’m beginning to see go on in this world… we need to stay woke ,and pay attention to what’s actually happening before our eyes while being distracted with daily nuances. So we all need things that we can focus in on daily, to help keep us focused on what’s important .I think this game will be a segue into that for lots of people that find it hard to multitask at times, becauseWe get distracted. Being able to focus is important for anything that we do in life, and I think that this game is just fun tool that could help.",How much I like it
5,2023-11-04 16:32:53,"I love the new game each time, and how they begin easy to learn how well you do.  The game said that the next time the game will be harder, but for the week or three that I finally started playing it (my adhd daughter recommended it to me because other games would bore me as soon as i got really good at them.   Each game has benefits, an example is one where you had to remember which squares had a football helmet, representing opponents. They disappeared and then two footballs appear. You have to make a path from one football to the second without using the square a helmet was in , using only your memory.   They do a tutorial and just allow it to play out, don’t rush it, and you should then fully understand how the game works.  You never play the same game twice in a row.  (Unless you select replay). It’s helpful for neurodivergent people and anyone who wants to help their memory skills develop.  I really enjoy it, but I think that’s obvious by now haha.",Great for people with ADHD but fun for all
5,2023-07-24 00:07:51,"its a really good app, really works the brain and etc. I have a bit of ADHD so it gets kinda hard to focus on it without gettin overwhelmed with the repetitiveness in some of the games. It really the games are really fun tho, puts your brain to work. To me the repetitive games are hardest because again, ADHD🙄but its helped me a bit with being more focused and believe it or not, you can get better with being more observed and pay attention to detail a lot more, it helped me a lot! Right now i’m 20 yrs of age and plan on having children with my gf. If any of you people are parents and see that your kid is struggling in someway educationally, i advise that you download this app and get them into this. I definitely plan on gettin my future kids into this; it can really help them get more focused more organized and so on. It even gives you back the results/reports of what you’ve done.

5,2020-01-10 17:17:53,"I didn’t expect I need anything like Impulse, but after watching the ad on Instagram I decided to try. And I’m so happy I saw that add!! The app is amazing, user experience is so neat and the color scheme is perfect. What i like the most is that I only need  5 min per day to stretch my brain muscle. So I complete daily brain sessions and feel really better (on a 17th training day now). Pricing is a bit tough in case of taking a monthly subscription, but I successfully utilized the Christmas offer the app proposed. Just for the price of 4 cups of coffee I now can have lifelong brain training!! I would advise the developer to add some brain music and sounds, say for focus, productivity, concentration (I personally consider this to be crucial for effective working or studying). Apart from that, are you planning to add some training streaks? I noticed in other apps that this feature motivates me the most. But anyway the app is great and i recommended it to my friends and family (and i’m not the type of a person to recommend every stuff i see)",Amazing brain workouts!!!!
5,2023-04-28 12:38:49,"This app is AWESOME I’m talking AWESOME. so first off, the app has ads only every once and a while, not every second and they are pretty chill because you only have to wait five to ten seconds to skip. They also have sales that one times gave 92% off of a premium package just because I picked the right box. You can also just remove ads for 5$ without ur having to buy the whole premium package. The app is also so fun for an adulation and mind game. The mini games that they do are so fun!!!! And yet it also tell you what it will improve on. For example one game might say at the bottom, “improves creative thinking” You can also start a streak and play little work out games every day. I honestly love this game so far after I got it YESTERDAY. I play it every day before bed or in the day when I’m bored because it’s usually hard to find fun games without getting bored of them. So I think this is the perfect game for all ages and all genders. DOWNLOAD IT IT’s WORTH IT",Why Impulse is so amazing
5,2022-08-12 02:29:11,"It’s great so far! I originally got it when I saw the AD on tik tok. I thought it was gonna be another bad app, but it’s actually not. It actually gives you exercises and games and tests that allow you to see things in a different light and jog your memory on things that maybe you need more focus on. For me, I need focus for my job. It’s extremely difficult to focus sometimes because I have so many things in life that I’m dealing with, and I get cluttered. This allows me to be active for my brain in my off time, because honestly, everything else started getting boring, even Tik tok! It doesn’t feel mindless and boring, allowing me to at least grow while in my spare time and not wasting seconds, hours, days on mindless entertainment. The best part is that they’re not the same questions every time, math problems, vocabulary questions.

2,2022-05-05 08:10:58,"I got this app thinking that I could relax by doing some fun puzzles for free. I have never seen so many lengthy ads that force you to interact with them as I have in this app. Due to the annoyance of having to deal with the same lengthy ads after ever one or two free activities that I did in the game, a pop up came up saying that I could get the great deal of having ads blocked for $2.99. I went ahead and did it. Then I kept playing and ads kept popping up. When I contacted the app customer service about this they replied that the ad block was only for that one specific puzzle out of all of the activities in the app. They also said this was “clearly stated” in the pop up, which with I disagree. All I saw was the words “ad block for 2.99.” If I had known, I would not have paid for that and I would just have probably deleted this app. There are other comparable apps that are interactive and good for different types of brain training, albeit in separate apps, but unless you pay for this app (which is actually a subscription either weekly or yearly) it is too frustrating to use.",Careful not to “impulse buy” all your money away in this app

I have ADHD. My TikTok and Instagram algorithms know this. I recently started seeing Impulse ads on both platforms that states “WHAT’S YOUR ADHD TYPE? TAKE THE TEST” implying that, within the app, there was some sort of ADHD type test. I thought “that sounds interesting” and started a free trial. Interestingly, this test was nowhere to be found. I thought “maybe it’s a premium feature?” so I mistakenly subscribed for $6.99 (I will be getting my money back from Apple). Nope. No “ADHD type test” anywhere. In fact, upon googling “impulse app ADHD test” I was shocked to find there are NO results except for the TikTok and Instagram ads themselves. Then it clicked, that this developer is utilizing apps with access to marketing and personal data to push fraudulent ads in a targeted manner. The brain-scan images that the company used in their advertisement, hilariously, have nothing to do with ADHD. They are stolen from an academic paper.

I wanted to use my time in commute in an efficient and fun way and that's why I searched for brain games in the first place. Impulse absolutely lived up to my expectations! I love their workouts - a little bit of work every day gives me a sense of fulfillment, it's not that I just played some goofy game on the phone, I actually DID something to develop my memory and improve focus. One thing to consider there is the brain-boosting habits, maybe it's worth paying more attention to them? Very often they seem appropriate and cool, but since they're not explained or anything, I just ignore them. If the workout is not enough for me, I can always go to the games and spend as much time as I want playing whatever game I like. My favorite category is Focus, so I play it the most, and recently I noticed that it became easier for me to concentrate at work. Probably, I'll try to binge-play other categories as well, hope the results will be just as good!",Useful app
1,2023-07-21 18:54:20,"Collects your personal information then there is basically a pay wall. You take the test but it won’t give the results unless you pay. Like just tell me upfront instead of trying to scam me. There is no information validating the results here. This app ONLY trains you to watch ads. Technically you can play for free but you will spend more time watching ads then playing the game. And everything else is behind a paywall. Apps like this should be illegal. They are super creepy. Gathering data on us without accountability.   Honestly, I am willing to pay for an app but I need to see some results first. But I did not last 15 minutes with the amount of ads. Tbh this app is no more helpful then any of the brain teaser game apps out now. Moreover, for an app for concentration, my ADHD does not have the attention span for all the ads. Seriously like one 30 sec ad for every level which take me about 15 seconds to play. It pops up that you can click through after five seconds which means you can click after five then it pops up an app store ad which takes five then after you click that it holds on the ad for another five seconds.

And the games provided for the level im on is pretty intense and exciting. The levels increase in difficulty as u pass each one. Which is where the intensity comes in for me. I only do it for 5 minutes a day. Bc I don’t want to get to addicted to it. I think it’s to late for that now.  I always read the reviews before downloading or putting my time into one much less leave my opinion on a review. But this one was actually worth it.

4,2023-01-30 04:08:51,"More of a support ticket but, certain question on the test such as, “Do you tend to think in more images or words?” Only has two responses. Though, while I’m sure that most people only can pick one or the other, I tend to think in both at the same time if possible. Answer choices such as images or words exclude those who think in both. It’s just a suggestion that you add more moderate answers for a couple of the questions, or all. The other tests I personally didn’t have too much problems with, yet I’m sure someone will complain anyways in the same way I am. It’s a great application that helps those who struggle with certain things, such as memory, strengthening your peripheral vision, focus, and more. The games are also engaging and easy to get into.

Some of the games are similar to the sort of testing I had done during my neuropsyche. eval. for ADHD so I feel like that adds to its credibility of being a brain-stimulating app. I also like how they paced the increase in difficulty of each game. When you’re further along in a game you can give feedback on if the last level was too difficult or easy which adjusts the next level accordingly. The games definitely feel stimulating to say the least, plus there’s a bunch of em so you’ll likely not get too bored or just good at one game if you play with the intention of bettering your brain.

What a scam. I was excited so I paid for a weekly subscription anyway, but notice how they don’t mention this “disclaimer” on the purchase screen, they just do everything they can to minimize cutting you off the lead and take your money. I’d say it’s really dumb, much wiser would be being more transparent with their customers to build long-term trust and reputation. But this… this is no different from other mainstream “brain tests” and “exercises” you find on the web—where all they want is just your cash.

One thing Indo not like about this app is the constant 99% score.  No matter how well I seem to do in different categories, the top score is 99. As an educator who specializes in success strategies, this is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Like the developers want me to keep coming back over and over to get that 100. I find this concept less motivating than beating a high score or something.  Sometimes some of the games do not set up correctly. I actually paid for a year of this app and then requested a refund for this very reason. This challenge added to the low motivation to create a less than ideal brain training app.  I would definitely compare this app to some of the others.

One of the only few educational apps I would put my money into. It is free to try, but to unlock access to all of the content does require a subscription of $7 weekly. However, you will find that these games are addicting, helpful, and aesthetically pleasing. They give you a very calming mindset and are lots of fun. I could play them for hours. I have noticed a great change in my day to day life since I started playing it daily. My awareness is sharper now. I find coming up with words in conversation is much easier than before. I am able to remember certain tasks and responsibilities that I would otherwise have trouble recalling. Such a wonderful app! Keep improving.","Fun, helpful, beneficial to your life!"
5,2022-08-18 05:14:14,"I absolutely LOVE this app! For a long time, I’ve wanted an app with multiple bite sized brain challenges or puzzles to be able to solve. This app gave me just that! I love the Workout section (or at least the free workout so far), and although I haven’t had this app for long, I can definitely see myself using it for a while. I haven’t bought any of the subscriptions, but I still feel like I’m getting a lot out of this app. So, if you can’t afford the subscriptions but you still want an app like this, this is a great choice. I can understand that some people might get frustrated and or annoyed about the amount of ads, but compared to a lot of other games I think the amount of ads is worth it. Overall, I personally love this app and I would definitely recommend!",I’ve been looking for an app like this!

That’s when I found Impulse and decided to give it a shot.   Ultimately, the results speak for themselves. I’ve been slowly making progress and I’m able to play certain games at a speed and precision I didn’t even realize I was capable. I cannot speak as to how well using Impulse has actually benefited me, but my mind feels sharp and I continue to get better by the day.   In terms of features I’d like to see in the future, I think there’s potential to include more gamification concepts such as streak freezes, leadership boards, and learning material to learn what could I do outside the app to keep working on keeping my brain sharp.",A must have for mental health
5,2021-10-04 06:31:02,"I’ve been using the app for a couple weeks and really enjoy it. The games are pretty unique and helped me understand what skills I’m good at and which ones I need to train more. I like that the “Progress” section shows you the average score for each category and specific game. I think it would definitely be nice to see the average score based on training skill too. For example, I noticed that my “Selective Attention” was high based on the high scores I got in a few games. I also noticed my “Working Memory” wasn’t as high based on some lower scoring games. I think it would definitely help seeing that in the “Progress” section so we can keep in mind what we need to work on. Maybe even some links to research articles or something for each training skill would be useful too",Pretty Fun and Useful
3,2022-10-27 13:41:37,"Frankly, this app is great for what it is. The games are fun, and the tracking is great. However, I was misled when I purchased a life time copy of this game. Perhaps I mis understood the nature of the sale, but this is a subscription service HOWEVER you can also purchase life time access to this app by paying a lump sum fee up front. I chose to do that during a sale they were having specifically for that deal. This was a few months ago.  After purchasing that life time access, I was STILL charged monthly for the subscription. I feel like I was mis led. Not accusing anyone of saying that it is a scam, but these guys 100% need to work on their wording when they say “life time access after paying this” but not explaining that you also have to pay a monthly subscription fee. To that end, buyer beware.   3 stars cause the actual content is great. -2 stars because the way they process their transactions are mis-leading at best.",Buyer beware
5,2023-02-12 21:13:21,"This game popped up when I was looking for word games. Then I discovered it was a brain-challenging game for various brain functions, some of which I felt were declining since COVID and aging. I found my strengths and weaknesses while having so much fun. I played for at least 4 or 5 hours the first day (though I had some obligations to finish). I ended up buying the year (for now) and set up my randomized daily challenges reminder. With each game, I have improved and learned “secrets” to get the right answers as well as completing them faster through practice. There are also other interesting “tests” that may give some insight to other brain concerns, like stress leveling and IQ, among others. Definitely worth the price.

I’m always subconsciously on the lookout for any way I can try to recover what I’ve lost. On a whim I downloaded the app with no expectations, unsure if I would want to go beyond the three day trial. After just the first day, I knew I was going to be investing in a subscription. The games are actually fun (hubby thinks so too) and the assessment aspect makes it easy for me to get a bit competitive. There are insightful quizzes and helpful “brain workout” plans.

It is very fun being able to play these logic puzzles daily and there is a clear polished feel to it all which for some might justify a subscription to the premium. To be clear: this product is technically free and you are given a good amount of games/tests but you also have the option of paying for the premium service with which you can become as smart as Einstein probably. Overall, perhaps I am a skeptic but I believe the primary way we should view this is as an entertaining app where you can complete daily logic puzzles and not as brain food. Great app though so it gets a 5* review from me.",Entertaining “Tests”
2,2022-11-18 02:56:13,"If I recall I signed up with a trial. Very shady to have such a high price and list it weekly. There are some beneficial games but not worth it in my opinion. There are dozens of plan options but really I was surprised that I was subscribed on this plan, I don’t really remember doing it and I never would have intentionally signed up for something with such a high weekly price. If you get this app just make sure to really figure out how much you’re paying, what you get, and how often.  Also, for that price I still have to watch lengthy ads in between each round? I don’t understand how this app has such high reviews when there are plenty of other apps with similar or better games for an exponentially cheaper price or free, and this is the first one I have come across that charges you weekly.   To the developers, please don’t bother responding unless you significantly decrease your pricing to something reasonable, and fix this ad scheme.","$6.99 weekly aka $28 a month, STILL HAS ADS"

I contacted Apple support as the developers have suggested in previous negative reviews - Apple says they have no record of a subscription and therefore cannot cancel it. This makes me think that I will be charged once my trial has ended and the developers are running some kind of scam.  I have never seen an app where there is no ability to cancel before your trial ends.  I have emailed the company as well, but I’m not expecting that they will get back to me.  If this charge goes through I will be contacting my credit card company to fight the charge.  This is ridiculous.  I spent an hour chatting with Apple and they’ve had to escalate it to a phone call because they couldn’t help me.

5,2022-07-30 22:35:33,"Fun and lots of games that keep my brain a little sharper. I liked the IQ test, it was pretty fun and challenging. The personality test was okay but I didn’t really like the fact that it made you choose between only two options per question when some of the words or concepts are definitely situationally more complex than to just choose between the two extremes.. but I get the point and of course as it says it isn’t an administered test so I didn’t take it too seriously. But the games are great and I feel like they help get me in a sharp mood.. if you get an offer to buy the yearly package for like 16 bucks, it seems like a good deal considering a lot of the games might have their own app with advertisements and you of course get more than that with this app..",Great App

Another one I thought I’d be better at is the arrow game, I was mistaken 😅 swipe the direction of the white arrow, no problem, swipe the opposite direction for the yellow arrows, no problem super easy, let’s just say I was a little overly confident especially when you start to speed up.

And as we age we need brain games to help keep us motivated & moving forward at a great & steady pace, this app does that.

I didn’t make it past three days before I was fed up with it. For the free trial app, you have to watch an ad before each game. That is understandable and I have no problem with that. However, when you click the “watch ad” button, the app just brings up a spinning load icon without going to the ad. It will do this three or four times before actually taking you to an ad. More than once, I had to just completely close the app and start again. It did the same thing. It is almost like they are trying to make it so annoying they force you to purchase the upgrade. They have definitely lost a customer here. Before you ask, no I do not have WiFi or service issues. Every single other app on my phone works flawlessly and without interruption.

I don’t like games that unnecessary stress me out , but I do appreciate a challenge that motivates my focus and observation as well as creativity. It serves it purpose, so far so good .

In this modern day and age where people have become so distracted and can’t focus on anything that does stimulate pleasure and enjoyment for more than a few seconds before they swipe up to the next reel this app is really a good refresher. I purchased the one time payment because I’m my opinion I believe it’s completely worth it and training my mind in this modern age will help me and everyone else who also made the purchase have an advantage in todays society.

I made sure to go into the App Store to cancel the subscription immediately after. I want to make sure I wasn’t charged almost $40 for a game!  That being said, I enjoyed playing this game. As I’ve grown, so has technology, so anything before high-tech computers and phones seems primitive.

I’ve been looking for ways to train concentration, persistence, and the ability to sort the random noise and distractions from my minute-to-minute life.    The Impulse approach - a research backed scalable suite of games addressing different cognitive functions, tracking improvements, and peer comparisons elicits just the right amount of competitiveness and distraction to dovetail in with the rest of my daily work. I can play a few games in a 5 minute break at my desk, or I can sit at my kitchen table with morning coffee instead of compulsively swiping through news and social media postings.  The app reflects and reinforces intentionality while staying fun.  I try to meditate 2-3x times a day, but if I’m fatigued or overly anxious it is very difficult for me to stay in the moment and often devolves into a power-nap.  The gaming style brain training reinvigorates me, and the quickness of the transitions from game to game helps with my cognitive elasticity.

I like puzzles so I find the games and the 5 or 10 minute sessions relaxing and engaging.    I just started playing and will edit my review if I find that it’s working for me.

Even the initial games have an appropriate difficulty level, though. I also like that I get notifications during the day to play more…which, oddly enough, only seem to show up when I’m idle. Each game details its focuses before you begin, which the app determines based on the preferences you set when you sign up. I generally don’t have large amounts of time to dedicate to entertainment-based apps (outside of fantasy football), but this self-improvement app is one I look forward to opening each morning.",Great so far

Once you move up a level in any puzzle, you can’t play the lower level anymore. When you get to level 10, you can’t do much more with it and it becomes boring. Some of my favorite games are impossible for me on level 10, so now I can’t really play them at all.   I wish they would add new puzzles. I’ve canceled my subscription, so it won’t renew, but I would have kept it if they made just a few simple changes. When you look at what you actually get for the price, it wasn’t worth it for me.

4,2023-08-07 17:05:25,Great news!!!! So when I first discovered this I seen that you could pay monthly yearly or one time payment I was just going to do the 3 day trial but then the app decided to give me a discount opportunity. I think it was 20% off 50% off or 92% off. It was three gift boxes and they mixed up after showing you what was in it and then you could choose. I was lucky enough to get to 92% off. It’s yearly tho but it’s cool!!  I love this app I’ve had it for 2 days but still I love it! I have not ran into any complications so far and that is good! The only issue is I don’t like the way it compares you to others it’s ok I guess but for someone who has had trouble with inferior feelings I feel it might discourage them if they were to get a lower percentage,Sooo it’s complicated
5,2022-04-23 04:59:18,"It’s a nice game it definitely keeps your mind sharp and tests your focus the only downfall is they try to sell every little level up and continue to after you decline. I mean after it’s declined it should not be pushed on you the way it is. once in a while cool but it’s too frequent. A lot of games have it where you can play without purchase and make in app purchases if you choose. Again this one has that but it seems it’s there just to pressure you to buying more. Over all what it’s intended for is good fun and a challenging game, WITHOUT the purchases!!

In the meantime, you’re paying 28 bucks a month— which if you keep it, ends up being almost 340 dollars per year! I’ve used many brain trainings apps and none were even close to being this outrageously expensive! Even intensely involved video games (with very advanced graphics and complicated storylines) don’t cost even a tenth of this to own for life!

However, because the information locked behind the premium version is your actual progress, you’re stuck seeing ‘comparison’ ratings. This might be fine, but it feels awful when because you miss 1 ghost on the memory ghost game, even due to a misstap, it’ll say you “You did better than 0% of players, don’t feel bad this level is hard.”. Which not only comes off as condescending, but unfortunately apparently is something to feel bad about because apparently I did worse than literally everyone because I accidentally tapped one tile to the right.  I know, it’s a silly thing to gripe about, but that combined with how the game actively punishes you for last second guessing is just not fun.

It’s super easy and there are so many fun educational games to stretch your head instead of those boring cross word puzzles. I suggest this app especially for ones who are interested into taking iq quizzes or seeing your growth in development.   There’s also hyped personality quizzes and more that you can learn about yourself to questions.   There are a lot of questions in most but short time.

You must decide at least 24 hours before your trial period expires to keep it free. If you decide and cancel on your third day they will charge you for whatever time period they have automatically set up. Everything is difficult to find. A trial period is supposed to be just that. If you only have 2 days to try and decide it is purposely misleading to call it a 3 day free trial. They knew this when they purposely set those rules so they could steal money from everyone willing to give them a try, but still try to legally protect themselves. Absolutely disgusting individuals!

If i take the time out of my day to do one of these quizzes i expect results not just what it is and literally nothing else. If i want to play more than 8 games then i feel like i should because there is at least 30 games on there and just about only 8 are available that is just a little bit insane.

The games and exercises are good, but not particularly special. There is no lack of brain training websites available - the only thing special about this is its app format. I will say, the UI is very well done and easy to navigate, but seriously? $6.99 a WEEK? Does this truly deliver *more than double* the worth of something like netflix or curiosity that have huge libraries of content? I want the developers to get paid well for their work, but this feels excessive. If I continued paying for this for more than one week I'd feel like I got played for a fool, so I think I'll do my brain training elsewhere. Thanks anyways.",App is nice but horrifically overpriced

And to be honest I didn’t want to keep the app anyways. Because I canceled my trial they are charging me $37 for no reason. It says they charge if you cancel on the 24hour mark but exactly 24hours before the trial ends it pays for the next subscription so You get like 2 hours to cancel or they will charge you.

Usually when an app offers a free trial they won’t bother you until the trial ends; not impulse. The free trial doesn’t grant you access to anything, it’s as good as not subscribing at all. Once the trial ended & I decided to subscribe weekly, they had the audacity to upsell me again with a 39$ one time payment immediately after I paid 6$ for the week. I believe the upselling & adds are counterproductive to the apps purpose. It’s ironic that the app meant to help me focus is the same one distracting me.

However, Impulse lets me train my brain in a very silk-like and fun way. The game are not taxing. In fact, they even help my mind unwind.   The reason being is, first, they are short in duration, which makes them easy to complete when taking breaks, waiting on the bus, etc. Second, they are colourful. I know this sounds silly but colours do make a huge impact. Think about how fun brain training would be in a dull environment.   I could go on and on, but one thing I'd like to add is affordability.

There is one game that I particularly hate, “Arrows,” because I cannot get my touch on my phone to register and I always have to swipe several times on each arrow instead of once.

Which is fine.. but not when it’s showing a woman bending over with her behind arched up as high as it can go so that it’s eye level with a dude basically sniffing her snatch.. If I wanted to see that all that… I’d go watch porn on a platform made for porn. Not an app that’s rated ages 4+ with no way to report such ads. Obviously it’s not straight up porn but it’s so implied that it looks like you’re watching porn. Fortunately I found a loophole to skip all ads. If you add a report feature that will allow the user to stop seeing ads from a specific company/developer (because the developers make several different ads), then I’ll go ahead and tell you how anyone can skip the ads, without violating any terms and conditions.

It doesn’t really affect gameplay though because you can still play some games, and you can complete your daily challenges without premium. My big issue is the tests that they have. Some include trauma response tests, IQ tests, etc. I wanted to do one, so I took the time to complete the test, and then only afterword was I told that I needed premium to see my answers… now I’m not here to beg to make the app totally free, but at least state a somewhere clearly that you need premium to unlock your answers.

Thanks to it I finally realized how poor my math skills are... But the thing is they were not like this all the time! Back at school, I was really good at math, not the best in the class, but really good! And look at what happened... I avoided doing some simple math on my own, thinking it would save me some time (or maybe I was just lazy), and as a result, having faced the tasks in Impulse math category, I saw how big my problem is. Huge, actually. The tasks and the games are not that difficult, they really aren’t. And back in the day, they would be a piece of cake for me. And now it feels like starting all over... But the good thing is that doing it with the app helps! I’ve been getting better and hope for more results!  My only suggestion would be to include more games to the Language category, just like Math it seems really useful. Oh, and the math lessons! They’re amazing! But it took me time to find them. Thank you!!!",Love this app!
4,2021-11-15 05:06:14,"So far I have played the game for two days and I like the fact of being challenged . and not knowing what to expect next. This game so far seems to give me a challenge based off of things that we have to deal with every day in daily life issues. Whether those things are good things or bad things, things that you have to ponder on etc. it challenged you and took you out of your zone that you may have been in at that moment. I’m looking forward to learning new things expanding my brain span ,and being challenged daily, because what I’m beginning to see go on in this world… we need to stay woke ,and pay attention to what’s actually happening before our eyes while being distracted with daily nuances. So we all need things that we can focus in on daily, to help keep us focused on what’s important .I think this game will be a segue into that for lots of people that find it hard to multitask at times, becauseWe get distracted. Being able to focus is important for anything that we do in life, and I think that this game is just fun tool that could help.",How much I like it
5,2023-11-04 16:32:53,"I love the new game each time, and how they begin easy to learn how well you do.  The game said that the next time the game will be harder, but for the week or three that I finally started playing it (my adhd daughter recommended it to me because other games would bore me as soon as i got really good at them.   Each game has benefits, an example is one where you had to remember which squares had a football helmet, representing opponents. They disappeared and then two footballs appear. You have to make a path from one football to the second without using the square a helmet was in , using only your memory.   They do a tutorial and just allow it to play out, don’t rush it, and you should then fully understand how the game works.  You never play the same game twice in a row.  (Unless you select replay). It’s helpful for neurodivergent people and anyone who wants to help their memory skills develop.  I really enjoy it, but I think that’s obvious by now haha.",Great for people with ADHD but fun for all
5,2023-07-24 00:07:51,"its a really good app, really works the brain and etc. I have a bit of ADHD so it gets kinda hard to focus on it without gettin overwhelmed with the repetitiveness in some of the games. It really the games are really fun tho, puts your brain to work. To me the repetitive games are hardest because again, ADHD🙄but its helped me a bit with being more focused and believe it or not, you can get better with being more observed and pay attention to detail a lot more, it helped me a lot! Right now i’m 20 yrs of age and plan on having children with my gf. If any of you people are parents and see that your kid is struggling in someway educationally, i advise that you download this app and get them into this. I definitely plan on gettin my future kids into this; it can really help them get more focused more organized and so on. It even gives you back the results/reports of what you’ve done.

The app is amazing, user experience is so neat and the color scheme is perfect. What i like the most is that I only need  5 min per day to stretch my brain muscle. So I complete daily brain sessions and feel really better (on a 17th training day now). Pricing is a bit tough in case of taking a monthly subscription, but I successfully utilized the Christmas offer the app proposed. Just for the price of 4 cups of coffee I now can have lifelong brain training!! I would advise the developer to add some brain music and sounds, say for focus, productivity, concentration (I personally consider this to be crucial for effective working or studying). Apart from that, are you planning to add some training streaks? I noticed in other apps that this feature motivates me the most. But anyway the app is great and i recommended it to my friends and family (and i’m not the type of a person to recommend every stuff i see)",Amazing brain workouts!!!!
5,2023-04-28 12:38:49,"This app is AWESOME I’m talking AWESOME. so first off, the app has ads only every once and a while, not every second and they are pretty chill because you only have to wait five to ten seconds to skip. They also have sales that one times gave 92% off of a premium package just because I picked the right box. You can also just remove ads for 5$ without ur having to buy the whole premium package. The app is also so fun for an adulation and mind game. The mini games that they do are so fun!!!! And yet it also tell you what it will improve on. For example one game might say at the bottom, “improves creative thinking” You can also start a streak and play little work out games every day. I honestly love this game so far after I got it YESTERDAY. I play it every day before bed or in the day when I’m bored because it’s usually hard to find fun games without getting bored of them. So I think this is the perfect game for all ages and all genders. DOWNLOAD IT IT’s WORTH IT",Why Impulse is so amazing

It actually gives you exercises and games and tests that allow you to see things in a different light and jog your memory on things that maybe you need more focus on. For me, I need focus for my job. It’s extremely difficult to focus sometimes because I have so many things in life that I’m dealing with, and I get cluttered. This allows me to be active for my brain in my off time, because honestly, everything else started getting boring, even Tik tok! It doesn’t feel mindless and boring, allowing me to at least grow while in my spare time and not wasting seconds, hours, days on mindless entertainment. The best part is that they’re not the same questions every time, math problems, vocabulary questions.

I have never seen so many lengthy ads that force you to interact with them as I have in this app. Due to the annoyance of having to deal with the same lengthy ads after ever one or two free activities that I did in the game, a pop up came up saying that I could get the great deal of having ads blocked for $2.99. I went ahead and did it. Then I kept playing and ads kept popping up. When I contacted the app customer service about this they replied that the ad block was only for that one specific puzzle out of all of the activities in the app. They also said this was “clearly stated” in the pop up, which with I disagree. All I saw was the words “ad block for 2.99.” If I had known, I would not have paid for that and I would just have probably deleted this app. There are other comparable apps that are interactive and good for different types of brain training, albeit in separate apps, but unless you pay for this app (which is actually a subscription either weekly or yearly) it is too frustrating to use.",Careful not to “impulse buy” all your money away in this app

I have ADHD. My TikTok and Instagram algorithms know this. I recently started seeing Impulse ads on both platforms that states “WHAT’S YOUR ADHD TYPE? TAKE THE TEST” implying that, within the app, there was some sort of ADHD type test. I thought “that sounds interesting” and started a free trial. Interestingly, this test was nowhere to be found. I thought “maybe it’s a premium feature?” so I mistakenly subscribed for $6.99 (I will be getting my money back from Apple). Nope. No “ADHD type test” anywhere. In fact, upon googling “impulse app ADHD test” I was shocked to find there are NO results except for the TikTok and Instagram ads themselves. Then it clicked, that this developer is utilizing apps with access to marketing and personal data to push fraudulent ads in a targeted manner. The brain-scan images that the company used in their advertisement, hilariously, have nothing to do with ADHD. They are stolen from an academic paper.

I wanted to use my time in commute in an efficient and fun way and that's why I searched for brain games in the first place. Impulse absolutely lived up to my expectations! I love their workouts - a little bit of work every day gives me a sense of fulfillment, it's not that I just played some goofy game on the phone, I actually DID something to develop my memory and improve focus. One thing to consider there is the brain-boosting habits, maybe it's worth paying more attention to them? Very often they seem appropriate and cool, but since they're not explained or anything, I just ignore them. If the workout is not enough for me, I can always go to the games and spend as much time as I want playing whatever game I like. My favorite category is Focus, so I play it the most, and recently I noticed that it became easier for me to concentrate at work. Probably, I'll try to binge-play other categories as well, hope the results will be just as good!",Useful app

Technically you can play for free but you will spend more time watching ads then playing the game. And everything else is behind a paywall. Apps like this should be illegal. They are super creepy. Gathering data on us without accountability.   Honestly, I am willing to pay for an app but I need to see some results first. But I did not last 15 minutes with the amount of ads. Tbh this app is no more helpful then any of the brain teaser game apps out now. Moreover, for an app for concentration, my ADHD does not have the attention span for all the ads. Seriously like one 30 sec ad for every level which take me about 15 seconds to play. It pops up that you can click through after five seconds which means you can click after five then it pops up an app store ad which takes five then after you click that it holds on the ad for another five seconds.

I only do it for 5 minutes a day. Bc I don’t want to get to addicted to it. I think it’s to late for that now.

4,2023-01-30 04:08:51,"More of a support ticket but, certain question on the test such as, “Do you tend to think in more images or words?” Only has two responses. Though, while I’m sure that most people only can pick one or the other, I tend to think in both at the same time if possible. Answer choices such as images or words exclude those who think in both. It’s just a suggestion that you add more moderate answers for a couple of the questions, or all. The other tests I personally didn’t have too much problems with, yet I’m sure someone will complain anyways in the same way I am. It’s a great application that helps those who struggle with certain things, such as memory, strengthening your peripheral vision, focus, and more. The games are also engaging and easy to get into.

Some of the games are similar to the sort of testing I had done during my neuropsyche. eval. for ADHD so I feel like that adds to its credibility of being a brain-stimulating app. I also like how they paced the increase in difficulty of each game. When you’re further along in a game you can give feedback on if the last level was too difficult or easy which adjusts the next level accordingly. The games definitely feel stimulating to say the least, plus there’s a bunch of em so you’ll likely not get too bored or just good at one game if you play with the intention of bettering your brain.

First, notice that the tests have an almost hidden disclaimer at the very bottom of each test overview that states: “for entertainment purposes only.” I overlooked it so I took it anyway, and then at the very end they give you a sneak peak of your results and then ask you to PAY even if you’re already on a free trial. What a scam. I was excited so I paid for a weekly subscription anyway, but notice how they don’t mention this “disclaimer” on the purchase screen, they just do everything they can to minimize cutting you off the lead and take your money. I’d say it’s really dumb, much wiser would be being more transparent with their customers to build long-term trust and reputation. But this… this is no different from other mainstream “brain tests” and “exercises” you find on the web—where all they want is just your cash.

One thing Indo not like about this app is the constant 99% score.  No matter how well I seem to do in different categories, the top score is 99. As an educator who specializes in success strategies, this is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Like the developers want me to keep coming back over and over to get that 100. I find this concept less motivating than beating a high score or something.  Sometimes some of the games do not set up correctly. I actually paid for a year of this app and then requested a refund for this very reason. This challenge added to the low motivation to create a less than ideal brain training app.  I would definitely compare this app to some of the others.

1,2023-06-07 04:32:17,"I signed up for the three day free trial, read the terms that you need to cancel 24 hours before the trial ends, and then found there was nowhere within the app or the App Store where I could cancel.  I contacted Apple support as the developers have suggested in previous negative reviews - Apple says they have no record of a subscription and therefore cannot cancel it. This makes me think that I will be charged once my trial has ended and the developers are running some kind of scam.  I have never seen an app where there is no ability to cancel before your trial ends.  I have emailed the company as well, but I’m not expecting that they will get back to me.  If this charge goes through I will be contacting my credit card company to fight the charge.  This is ridiculous.  I spent an hour chatting with Apple and they’ve had to escalate it to a phone call because they couldn’t help me.  How can this company tell you to go to Apple to cancel your trial, but Apple has no record it of?",No way to cancel
5,2022-07-30 22:35:33,"Fun and lots of games that keep my brain a little sharper. I liked the IQ test, it was pretty fun and challenging. The personality test was okay but I didn’t really like the fact that it made you choose between only two options per question when some of the words or concepts are definitely situationally more complex than to just choose between the two extremes.. but I get the point and of course as it says it isn’t an administered test so I didn’t take it too seriously. But the games are great and I feel like they help get me in a sharp mood.. if you get an offer to buy the yearly package for like 16 bucks, it seems like a good deal considering a lot of the games might have their own app with advertisements and you of course get more than that with this app..",Great App

Another one I thought I’d be better at is the arrow game, I was mistaken 😅 swipe the direction of the white arrow, no problem, swipe the opposite direction for the yellow arrows, no problem super easy, let’s just say I was a little overly confident especially when you start to speed up.

A month ago I had made it my mission to make get stronger mentally, I did some research and found out that learning a new language is great for your mental health so I decided to download a app (Doulingo) that could help me learn Russian. About a month in I realized that when I started a language lesson in the morning my head was just not ready. So I got this app to, I use this app before my language app in the mornings and it’s working wonders!!! I am learning Russian so much more easier and faster then I was before and this app helped me a lot! So thanks developers!!!!!!!

There are suggestions on how to improve your mood, communication with others, your life in so many ways. It’s just amazing. And as we age we need brain games to help keep us motivated & moving forward at a great & steady pace, this app does that. The game’s challenges you in all areas of your brain & helps you to push yourself further all while telling you how you performed against your peers. I suggest this app to everyone.

1,2020-04-11 19:29:33,"I was extremely interested in this app based on the reviews. However, I was also extremely disappointed. I wanted to try the trial version before committing to purchase. I didn’t make it past three days before I was fed up with it. For the free trial app, you have to watch an ad before each game. That is understandable and I have no problem with that. However, when you click the “watch ad” button, the app just brings up a spinning load icon without going to the ad. It will do this three or four times before actually taking you to an ad. More than once, I had to just completely close the app and start again. It did the same thing. It is almost like they are trying to make it so annoying they force you to purchase the upgrade. They have definitely lost a customer here. Before you ask, no I do not have WiFi or service issues. Every single other app on my phone works flawlessly and without interruption. This is definitely on Impulse’s end and it is very sad.",Sad

Although, since I have been using impulse I’ve actually noticed a huge improvement, and the people around me have also. I’m only 24 years old so this is a big deal for being my age. Also, this isn’t one of those reviews to get some extra “bonuses” like other apps do, I legitimately have noticed this app helping me.

Even allows you to get notifications in case you forget which this app will help with everyday…  i promise you will never believe your actually helping your brain while having fun!!!

Helps to unwind and relax my mind or stimulate and inspire in a positive and beneficial way. It has features also to tailor to the intensity of what you are going for mood wise . I don’t like games that unnecessary stress me out , but I do appreciate a challenge that motivates my focus and observation as well as creativity. It serves it purpose, so far so good . I recommend it. I enjoy finding patterns, connections and visual /spatial aspects as well as language and reading comprehension. Looking forward to the math exercises since I know I could really use the practice and encouragement to strengthen those skills.",Great mental workout . I recommend
5,2023-01-26 13:28:05,I’ve only used the app for a couple hours now and the way it challenges your brain is superb and it only gets more challenging the better you get while still being enjoyable. In this modern day and age where people have become so distracted and can’t focus on anything that does stimulate pleasure and enjoyment for more than a few seconds before they swipe up to the next reel this app is really a good refresher. I purchased the one time payment because I’m my opinion I believe it’s completely worth it and training my mind in this modern age will help me and everyone else who also made the purchase have an advantage in todays society. Highly recommend this app and I’ll be using it everyday!!!!!,EXCELLENT FOR TRAINING YOUR BRAIN

Before canceling my subscription today, “Restore Purchases” was pressed and I received a pop up saying I purchased the lifetime upgrade, which I don’t want at all! I made sure to go into the App Store to cancel the subscription immediately after. I want to make sure I wasn’t charged almost $40 for a game!  That being said, I enjoyed playing this game. As I’ve grown, so has technology, so anything before high-tech computers and phones seems primitive. I can honestly say I still enjoy reading paper back books, but any old techniques for challenging my brain are so outdated now. Good game filled with good puzzles.

5,2023-06-16 13:53:04,"I’ve been living with anxiety and depression since I was 18 (mid 50’s now), and recently diagnosed with adult ADHD.  I’ve been looking for ways to train concentration, persistence, and the ability to sort the random noise and distractions from my minute-to-minute life.    The Impulse approach - a research backed scalable suite of games addressing different cognitive functions, tracking improvements, and peer comparisons elicits just the right amount of competitiveness and distraction to dovetail in with the rest of my daily work. I can play a few games in a 5 minute break at my desk, or I can sit at my kitchen table with morning coffee instead of compulsively swiping through news and social media postings.  The app reflects and reinforces intentionality while staying fun.  I try to meditate 2-3x times a day, but if I’m fatigued or overly anxious it is very difficult for me to stay in the moment and often devolves into a power-nap.  The gaming style brain training reinvigorates me, and the quickness of the transitions from game to game helps with my cognitive elasticity.

I’ll go to get something from a room and  get distracted by something and forget to grab it when I leave the room.  So, the app allows you to choose how long you’d like to play.  I like puzzles so I find the games and the 5 or 10 minute sessions relaxing and engaging.    I just started playing and will edit my review if I find that it’s working for me.  I chose the trial membership.  I appreciate apps that allow you to try before subscribing. I am willing to pay for something if it works.

5,2022-10-18 13:27:05,"I’ve only had it for 2-3 days, but it’s exactly the type app I was hoping for. I assume, as the app states, the games will continue to increase in difficulty as I progress. Even the initial games have an appropriate difficulty level, though. I also like that I get notifications during the day to play more…which, oddly enough, only seem to show up when I’m idle. Each game details its focuses before you begin, which the app determines based on the preferences you set when you sign up. I generally don’t have large amounts of time to dedicate to entertainment-based apps (outside of fantasy football), but this self-improvement app is one I look forward to opening each morning.",Great so far
4,2023-07-03 19:14:53,"It’s good for what it is. I paid $15 for a 1 year subscription because the ads were non-stop. I enjoy most of the games/puzzles, but there’s a lot of room for improvement.   Once you move up a level in any puzzle, you can’t play the lower level anymore. When you get to level 10, you can’t do much more with it and it becomes boring. Some of my favorite games are impossible for me on level 10, so now I can’t really play them at all.   I wish they would add new puzzles. I’ve canceled my subscription, so it won’t renew, but I would have kept it if they made just a few simple changes. When you look at what you actually get for the price, it wasn’t worth it for me. There are better options available for the price.",Decent

So now even after we removed it it still wants us to make the final purchase, this money could have gone to so much better, it could have gone to family time or donations but instead it goes to scammers like them!

It may seem like and the games are games that we played when we were younger, but in all actuality when we were younger they were meant to help stimulate our brain and make it work at a point to.

The games aren’t that difficult when you first start and very easy to pick up, there’s also creative games you can play aside from the 3 brain training games a day.  There is a subscription you can acquire to unlock more features for the app but I can’t lie, the free version is just as good as the paid! I do see myself acquiring a subscription in the future!

But now whenever I feel bored or restless I’ll open up the Impulse app and I’m able to just tune in and get some good metal workouts going while having the comfort of being right on my phone.

4,2023-08-07 17:05:25,Great news!!!! So when I first discovered this I seen that you could pay monthly yearly or one time payment I was just going to do the 3 day trial but then the app decided to give me a discount opportunity. I think it was 20% off 50% off or 92% off. It was three gift boxes and they mixed up after showing you what was in it and then you could choose. I was lucky enough to get to 92% off. It’s yearly tho but it’s cool!!  I love this app I’ve had it for 2 days but still I love it! I have not ran into any complications so far and that is good! The only issue is I don’t like the way it compares you to others it’s ok I guess but for someone who has had trouble with inferior feelings I feel it might discourage them if they were to get a lower percentage,Sooo it’s complicated
5,2022-04-23 04:59:18,"It’s a nice game it definitely keeps your mind sharp and tests your focus the only downfall is they try to sell every little level up and continue to after you decline. I mean after it’s declined it should not be pushed on you the way it is. once in a while cool but it’s too frequent. A lot of games have it where you can play without purchase and make in app purchases if you choose. Again this one has that but it seems it’s there just to pressure you to buying more. Over all what it’s intended for is good fun and a challenging game, WITHOUT the purchases!! So five star for its design and reason for design but 3-4 stars for profit intentions and aggravation from pressing the issue  honestly….",Impulse

In the meantime, you’re paying 28 bucks a month— which if you keep it, ends up being almost 340 dollars per year! I’ve used many brain trainings apps and none were even close to being this outrageously expensive! Even intensely involved video games (with very advanced graphics and complicated storylines) don’t cost even a tenth of this to own for life! I’m truly appalled at how much they’re charging and disgusted by their use of “free trial” to lure people into paying an exorbitant amount for something that isn’t even worth a fraction of what they charge.

I loved the app! The way things were designed, the challenges, the brain-twisting, the fun… I loved it.   Now, I am a Middle School beginner and I forgot about the game six months ago and randomly stopped playing it. I saw my brother playing it and I asked why he’s on his phone. He told me he’s plying Impulse so I remembered… and I downloaded the game on my phone. It got better from six or ten months ago! Especially how challenging things are.

2,2023-07-08 16:42:50,"So, I mostly enjoyed my time with Impulse these last 38 days. However, because the information locked behind the premium version is your actual progress, you’re stuck seeing ‘comparison’ ratings. This might be fine, but it feels awful when because you miss 1 ghost on the memory ghost game, even due to a misstap, it’ll say you “You did better than 0% of players, don’t feel bad this level is hard.”. Which not only comes off as condescending, but unfortunately apparently is something to feel bad about because apparently I did worse than literally everyone because I accidentally tapped one tile to the right.  I know, it’s a silly thing to gripe about, but that combined with how the game actively punishes you for last second guessing is just not fun.

5,2023-06-10 16:58:57,The app is  really good but my problem isnt the app its me i get almost all correct the only ones i got incorrect was the paper plastic sorting game and i think this can really improve you memory mental maths and more but most importantly i am 8 being able to get these puzzles right in pure seconds so this app right here i think will tell you if you are gifted or not depending on your age and skill on this great app and overall this app it's so good I give you a five star this app help you improve you're thinking skills and your brain will be able to calculate what is what in only a matter of seconds so thats why this app is a 5 STAR,IMPULSE

5,2022-03-14 01:14:57,I stumbled across this app while trying another as usual. Then I started with a couple questions and before I knew it I was hooked.  I have only had this app for <24 hours and half of those hours were playing!  I love the investigator/riddle mode! The scenarios ask a question and the answer is “FREE TEXT” and could be correct… (Not sure if they read the answers and get back to me …) I have PTSD and I try to find a method to ease my angst … the only thing that I don’t like is how expensive the app is for continued use (after 3-day trial)… I know the App “Headspace” gives an extended free use (1-Year) for people like me during a pandemic.,Best mentally challenging game

Also - there are tests to learn your IQ, what your emotional intelligence is, your Archetypes, take a quick IQ, left brain vs right brain test, etc - I learned so much about myself that nobody or counselor would have ever told me. You can find what career is best suited for you too!!  I have a 129 IQ when for the longest time I thought I was completely stupid. I knew I was right brained and was drawn to music, but for a career wise I never considered it as an option. You just have to try it to understand what I mean.

I have been slowly building back my physical strength, but at 65 I don’t want to neglect my mental fitness. So far I am finding the program both challenging and encouraging.

Their are tons of different games which helps keep my attention and if I get bored of one type of game their is another I want to play. Also all the rewards and scores  that they keep track of for you really helps you enjoy the games! Getting a better score then you did last time is very satisfying, as well as seeing how well you compare to your peers. I recommend this app to anyone and everyone!",Better than any fidget spinner!

Even though I used to procrastinate doing it after seeing the little notifications each day, I’m starting to realize I actually enjoy doing it and I no longer see it as a task. The way they set up the games are enjoyable and I can already tell that they are helping me. I also like how there an IQ tests and self tests to help understand yourself greater. 5/5 star app as far as I am concerned. I think it’s healthy for the mind to do stuff like this.

Not in the way that the screen has made us envision, but in the way that we are so brainwashed by television and “screens” in general… we legit LOOK LIKE ZOMBIES!  Even our CHILDREN DO.   And that the next generation y’all…. This game reminds me that a screen doesn’t have to have a negative effect on someone.  I love utilizing my brain.

This game is perfect for kids around 12-13, but accidentally paying for a game is not fun because anyone’s parents could get mad or something. Playing without paying is still really awesome. It’s not my decision to make you guys like not have that paying pop up thingy, but this game is still awesome. I forgot to mention at the beginning, but I would rate it a 5 and a half if I could because of the paying pop up thingy whatever. Overall, this game is a really fun one, and I wish you good luck continuing to create games/edit games :)",Awesome but…

This is such a wonderful because it’s also going to help keep my brain strong, the brain has in mind or an organ, and we have to flex them in order to keep in tact and grow as we mature over the years.

5,2023-04-14 03:04:59,"As a psychology and neuroscience enthusiast, Impulse has blown my brain away!   I've spent many weeks reading about brain training & cognitive performance over the past year, and specifically about boosting memory, attention, and retention.  Let me tell you, this app is what was missing from my daily life. I couldn't always train my brain when at work or university; that always ended in mental burnout. However, Impulse lets me train my brain in a very silk-like and fun way. The game are not taxing. In fact, they even help my mind unwind.   The reason being is, first, they are short in duration, which makes them easy to complete when taking breaks, waiting on the bus, etc. Second, they are colourful. I know this sounds silly but colours do make a huge impact. Think about how fun brain training would be in a dull environment.   I could go on and on, but one thing I'd like to add is affordability. I wish the premium version was free so that I'd make full use of this app.   With that being said, keep up Impulse!",Mmmmm
5,2023-01-23 02:08:27,"I played this game for the free trial because I looove brain workout games, but I never found one I cared for too much. As I played more and more, I enjoyed it more, and more. There is definitely so much to offer! This is by far the best brain app game I’ve ever tried. I’ll be 31 January 27… I ended up forgetting to cancel after the trial. But I didn’t want to cancel just yet because it was THAT good.. I justified the lapse of the trial for a couple weeks because it’s my birthday lol.

It’s like my purchase was never made, starting from square one. I did reach out to Impulse support, and received an E-mail Failure notification from G-mail. Since this doesn’t appear to be resolvable, I’m going to request a refund, through Apple and also PayPal, since they both protect buyers in this type of situation. Absolutely ridiculous.   I love this app, I thought it was great that they offered the Lifetime purchase option, which I chose to purchase.

5,2021-11-06 18:14:11,i think this is a really good game and it makes me happy that they ask for feedback because it feels like they actually care about the people playing the games. I like that i can play this for free with ads but also if i didn’t want ads i could pay for a subscription. i also like that if they do include ads they don’t bombard you. the games are challenging but not too challenging to the point where i can’t play. it makes me feel accomplished when i do play a game and get it right because i actually have to use my brain to figure it out. definitely one of my new favorite apps,good game

My IQ has been tested at above average before college and then I took the IQ test in the app and I am only at the average level yet it only took me two days to get back to the point I was as a youngster but I can see where I can benefit from further training. I can see I slipped because since I’m disabled now and unable to work any longer and I’m not using my brain the way I used to I have lost the edge.

4,2023-06-19 19:49:23,"The only reason I gave this app a four star review is because it has a lifetime membership. Most apps do not! The lifetime membership makes it worth it because hopefully they will improve it overtime.  Right now the games are pretty boring and even doing your absolute best you get a very low score. I can’t beat more than 4% of the population on most games, and they don’t actually give you any tips or suggestions on what you are doing wrong or how to improve. So, not sure how this app is going to improve your brain. Instead it just shows you your limitations.  Yet, something still draws me to the app.  The graphics are fantastic.",Lifetime membership
2,2023-05-14 20:40:26,"I’m sorry I purchased this game. I’m aging, and interested in “so-called” brain trainers to keep my mind sharp. This is not it. It offers the same games over and over with no feedback on how to improve. It only gives you a one line, “you did better than X % of your peers.” How is that helpful? There needs to be more variety. There is one game that I particularly hate, “Arrows,” because I cannot get my touch on my phone to register and I always have to swipe several times on each arrow instead of once. It’s really frustrating.   The only reason I gave Impulse two stars instead of one is because the tests do offer some interesting and helpful information. It needs a much wider range of more interesting games and puzzles, though.",Repetitive and boring

I particularly enjoy the variety of games offered - from matching cards to solving puzzles, there is something for everyone. The app also has a progress tracking feature which is helpful for monitoring my progress over time.  I appreciate that the app encourages daily use, as it has become a habit for me to play the games every day. It's an enjoyable way to challenge my brain and I have noticed an improvement in my focus and concentration since I started using it.

I think with all the entertainment and distractions that occupy our brain space on a daily basis I would definitely encourage others to give this app a try if they want to do something that’s going to be proactive and keep their mind sharp.

I began with the free trial, spending hours exploring the various games to test my IQ. This allowed me to learn more about my thought processes, which was intriguing.  However, I now feel disheartened as my trial has ended. The developer has introduced ads that are not only lengthy but also mandatory to watch without the option to exit, despite frequent screen changes.  Your app is impressive, but the approach of compelling users to view long ads in the hopes of driving subscription sign-ups feels quite desperate and I won't give in to such tactics.",Ads

It also keeps track of the days you’ve done in a week, which I am not personally the biggest fan of but I’m sure someone would appreciate it.

It does cost a little money. In the registration process it makes it seem like your cheapest option is a 3-day free trial and then $6.99/week but then I clicked on the x and was able to start to play. Then a screen popped up in which you need to guess where the reward was and I found an 89% off coupon. I decided that $0.57/week was worth it. Good luck finding a good coupon!

It's not bad but I decided I did not want to pay for it. I cancelled after about an hour of play. Looking in my subscriptions it said it expired in the three days.

Turns out those people who rated it are probably either really rich, really gullible, or complete liars. This game is not playable, I’m tired of being asked to pay yearly/weekly (I’ve only played this game for 10 minutes now), and can we have the option to get our results by watching an ad?

I figured with so many positive ratings, it has to be legit and above board, so I proceeded.   Upon installation, it also stated very clearly that I could cancel in the settings of the app. Ummmm... there are precisely ZERO ways to cancel in the settings of the app. Zero.

In terms of challenges once you reach the max level you “can’t” restart to see if you can speed through the course. Which is a bummer because it would’ve been neat to try again from level one.

1,2020-06-05 05:41:30,"If you are going to charge for using your app, just put the cost up front, before you download it. Don’t try and see if you can catch people off by making it free and then right after your splash screen (before actually using your app) throw in a cost to use the app. There’s a difference between apps the cost money to download and in app purchases. This is the bastard of the two, trying to sneak in a app that cost money up front, but after you download it for free. You don’t do this as a marketing strategy, you do this because you know there’s a chance that some people won’t notice. Hoping that someone will see it’s free and miss the outrageous cost of $7 a week. You’re app isn’t worth $7 in total let alone weekly. This app should be flagged and taken down.

I have played several ‘brain’ games and this one seems likely to increase its set targets of memory, speed of thought, thinking agility etc. I’m also familiar with many of the psyche tests offered, took Al of them and they were consistent with previous results.    BUT …. I ventured into 2 IQ tests … the 30 min 60 ques and the shorter 15 min 30 question and both tests contained questions in which the right answer was NOT one of the choices available. In the 60 ques test (which was a similar format of ques as the std Stanford Binet and Weschler tests) 6 questions I encountered did not contain the right answer in the options given. I’ve taken the Stanford Binet and Weschler multiple times over the decades as a matter of curiosity to gage how my IQ might have changed. Neither of these tests proffer an accurate set of questions.   For what it’s worth.

It literally told me to “cancel any time in the App Store” here I am on the App Store with no clear place to go.   I look into apps like this to help in my life long recovery from multiple concussions.  I was drawn to this one because it brings in information about Teauma responses which is of particular interest to me since my trauma responses trigger seizures since my last head injury.

I literally don’t right now, which turned out to be a good thing, because the app made no less than three unauthorized charge attempts. 😳  The only thing I authorized was the free trial. I know because there was even text on that screen that said “You will not be charged at this time.” It would certainly be easy for someone to accidentally authorize a payment to you with all the different offers and popups offering the paid version, but I was very careful to X out of all those or tap the “No thanks“ button. Those were mildly annoying, but I wouldn’t have even minded that too much.  I DO, however, mind that you tried to charge me without my permission. Your multiple attempts (rightly) triggered my bank’s fraud alert, and I had to make several calls to get my check card unfrozen. I could’ve done without that annoyance too.

I was concerned, and a little confused about a purchase I made within the app. So I emailed IMPULSE and requested assistance. Since IT/developing is not my forte, I was inquisitive on the issue. From the beginning of our conversation IMPULSE was surprisingly curt, discourteous, and not happy to help a confused customer.

How convenient that beating lvl 10 at any game means I’m better than 99% of everyone else, every time. That’s just silly. You can continue to fool most people or you can do right and actually implement a ranking system. Additionally, there’s a lot of pseudoscience. The worst offender being the personality tests.

There is a test for if you have ADHD or not, but the test advertised on Instagram and on the App Store “What is your ADHD type” with archetypes like “ring of fire”, “inattentive”, “limbic”, etc doesn’t exist in the app. So the whole reason I got the app, to understand my ADHD better, isn’t part of the app at all.

4,2023-07-24 17:05:50,I have no issue it was just the sort by color one I didn’t like at first and got one wrong because I thought I had to drag it into the right trash not click on the trash so that’s why I got it wrong but other to that I have no issue with it. I do like it. And look  I understand the creator charges because they need money but if this is to improve someone’s memory and help them thru what they’ve been through it should be free because you never know if what they’ve been through has caused them to not be able to work.,My thoughts
5,2022-11-02 22:00:36,"I like impulse because when I use the app it opens my mind, especially when my mind is just thinking of or stuck on one subject in school. When I go to a math class I try to play for at least 20mins before math, it helps to pay attention to things out of the norm (when everyone sees black and white, I see it to but in color so I can see in depth differences) one of the best apps to expand mental thoughts. Look for differences and make a difference to identify what’s different to make a difference.",Why I like impulse…
5,2022-05-29 23:06:32,"I realized I’ve have always been attracted to more intelligent apps. I’ve always been a nerd and will most likely always be one. Impulse helps to ground my mind in the wake of my busy schedule not including my 2 kids under 5. Impulse reminds me when I’m doing well and when I’m not doing well. And I look at the days Im doing well very closely to find out why I’m not doing well. This way I can be more consistent and flourish to new heights I could only dream of. Thank you, for creating a very well rounded app for people like me.",Good Practice
5,2023-07-08 17:45:57,"I’ve enjoyed every little game that this app has as “training”. It’s severely great training for the brain because as you train your brain, you get to keep it more so stress free because the “training” is just calm and relatively easy games. Highly recommend this app.   All of this coming from a man who died twice in under 6 months was put in a coma and started over from the mental age of zero. My brain is back workin as it should and that’s because of games like this.",Rate from a man with a severe traumatic brain injury.
1,2023-10-16 05:51:12,"I impulsively downloaded this after being clickbaited by their own ad on IG. It was an info graph showing different ADHD subtypes based on taking their test. It’s an expensive app subscription, so I signed up for the free trial. Then I spent my valuable time and energy taking the test. At the end they REQUIRE YOU TO PAY to see the test result.  The company boasts about how many millions of users they have, yet are so profit oriented (aka greedy) that they try to pull every trick to get your money. Now I’m spending even more of my time and energy writing this in hopes to save you from wasting your time and money with this ironically named Impulse app. There are plenty of free and/or better resources for people who want to improve their brains or ADHD.",Impulse clickbait - very disappointed
5,2023-02-10 15:14:55,"I have been struggling with post partum anxiety and found a big difference since using this app… I feel so much better, I sleep better, and starting to feel like myself again. I also play these games instead of doom scrolling on social media which I think was contributing to my anxiety. Love the puzzles and bonus levels! Only feedback I have is would like more bonus levels and the option to only play the bonus levels in the puzzle section.",Helped my anxiety
3,2023-07-07 20:49:04,"The games are fun and I feel like they are good for brain exercise but you will literally be asked to buy a subscription dozens of times as there are paywalls everywhere. The worst is that if you take a test, they will not tell you you have to pay for the results until you are done. That to me is downright cruel. Also, you will watch tons of ads. I wish they would make free membership more enjoyable as I am fine it’s limited use and watching ads, but I don’t understand why the don’t just make you pay from the start if they want your money so bad.","Fun, but Don’t bother unless willing to pay"
5,2022-12-31 02:19:06,I really enjoy this app. I immediately downloaded after reading reviews. I ended up subscribing after playing a couple games. I work in a high pace environment and sometimes just need a distraction that causes me to focus on something else and this app is just the right thing! I’ve given myself a goal to complete 5 minutes worth of games each day and it’s already helped me center myself during stressful days by allowing me to focus on the game. I’m really happy I gave it a try.,Great mind release!
5,2022-08-20 18:05:02,"I don’t usually review apps, but this one is different. Recently, I haven’t been able to read or stimulate my brain as much as I’d like to. I clicked on the ad for this app by accident and I ended up enjoying the games. The games are really fun and they allow me to think harder as I progress. Not only does this provide enjoyment, but it’s sharpening my ability to think and recall what task I’m in the process of doing. For any of you who want an enjoyable and stimulating game, I’d definitely recommend this one to anyone.",Great App!
5,2023-11-10 00:49:58,"I have been enjoying Impuse game which is a fun way to keep my brain active and was disappointed that it logged me out recently when I went into the game.  I sent a request for help to see if there was a way to log back in and get my progress restored so that I was not starting over at level 1. I was very pleased to receive a quick response to help me restore my progress. Today I was successfully able to restore my progress. Great game, great support!",Impulse has great customer support
5,2023-09-21 02:28:09,"Love this it’s one of the best apps I’ve ever used. It gives you three different games to help your brain It’s so good. It took me so short of a time to learn how to work this app and it took me about like 14 seconds to learn how to do this app and it was so good that I would recommend it to anyone in the world like I would, I can’t even say anything I would recommend it to anyone in this world right now. I can’t say anything bad about it because it’s one of the best apps I’ve ever use to shop in my brain.",Love it
5,2023-08-19 16:23:38,"It is worth every penny! The games are fun and challenging. It is definitely sharpened my brain, even lowering anxiety. This review actually sounds like a paid review or a bit review, I know. But it’s not. This app is actually, truly that helpful. If you have brain fog, anxiety, or trouble remembering things, USE THIS APP. Your brain will absolutely improve. I especially love the encouragement it gives if I don’t do well on a challenge. The better you get at challenges, the harder they get, keeping you sharp! Five stars.",GET THIS APP AND USE IT!!!
3,2023-08-16 11:30:41,"I am on 110 day streak with the daily training. So safe to say I’ve been at it long enough to give this feedback. While most of the training games are good and even fun, there are some boring ones (pass the ball, arrows direction). While an app having a few boring games is to be expected, there aren’t enough total games in rotation to keep me wanting to come back.    Would love to see at least 2-3x more games added for the daily workouts. Otherwise this isn’t worth paying for a year subscription because you’ll be bored within a couple of months.",Need more games for the day training.
5,2023-07-25 15:16:34,"I have only been using this app for a few days, but it really has allowed me to get to my own knowledge better. The games are really fun, yet effective.    I did have some trouble with a few of the games, but I probably just didn’t understand the directions correctly.    The quiz’s that are available are awesome, as well. They had helped me gain a better understanding of what goes on in my head.    Other than that, this app is amazing and had me starting my day feeling good.    Now take in mind I have the free version of this app, yet it still allows you just as much availability than the yearly/weekly version does. There is a free trial which I think is great for those who want to try out the app without having to pay if they don’t like it.    I strongly recommend this app if you are looking for something to stretch your knowledge!!!",• Amazing! •
5,2023-05-31 00:22:09,"Dementia runs in my family - both on the maternal and paternal side - so I’m always looking for ways to keep my mind sharp. I heard about Impulse and decided to give it a try. I’m so very glad I did! The games (exercises) are fun to play, more challenging the further you go along and short enough to where you’re not easily bored. I’ve recommended this app to several friends and family members. If you’re looking for a fun and engaging way to test your cognitive skills on a daily basis, download Impulse!",Excellent App!!!
5,2023-03-05 14:29:11,"I was looking to distract my inward ego from rambling on stressing me out over quite literally nothing.   These games allow me to move past thoughts and allow them time to cool down while distracting me.   I’ve also been reading, journaling, going to therapy, working out, and trying to be more in touch with how the mind works and being present. There’s not always time to sit down and meditate so this app is my next level of simple distraction but also allowing me to continually stretch my brain.",Calming.
3,2023-05-16 15:58:10,"Look, it’s actually one of the better or best brain training apps. Fun, user friendly, extremely informative, content other apps lack. This would be 5 stars but I was under the impression that this was free, NOPE! Too bad though I like it. Especially how in-depth the information provided is, such as how the specific parts of the brain & their function. Also enjoyed how I was shown the % of “my peers” which I scored higher than after each activity/game.  Again too bad I was tricked into downloading it. Though it may be worth purchasing, if it were as one time fee, NOT A DANG SUBSCRIPTION!!!!",$$$ IS REQUIRED don’t waste your time
5,2022-03-04 16:35:48,"Exactly the kind of exercises I was looking for!  After reading the reviews, I’m glad I dove right in and skipped having to manage through the ads.  Being able to fly though all kinds of activities that help improve focus, attention, memory, while minimizing distraction is exactly why I got the app.  Even more, I love how each game/puzzle/activity highlights what I’m working on/improving.  Overall, this is such a fun productive time killer….rare to find one with this much variety and challenge.",Hit the spot
5,2023-11-04 19:29:29,"It’s an awesome app with regular updates and you can do a one time forever purchase it’s incredible how well they keep up their product. Just excellent.  I love the games, they are not just good for your brain, they are fun and entertaining, I tried a few apps and this one is best, been using it for more than a year now. I have 0 complaints. This app is one of my valued possessions that is absolutely totally worth the money.",My short term memory is phenomenally better when I exercise daily
5,2023-07-21 19:32:44,"Impulsive is a pretty fun brain training game that most of the time I don’t realize is a brain training game. Most of the mini games are pretty challenging but make you really think(my personal favorite being the 1 line game.) mini flex, but I took an iq test and it said it was 125 which I'm pretty happy about seeing as I’m still relatively young compared to others with that iq. Overall, I really like the game and I recommend it to anyone who has too much free time and wastes it on social media.",Made me happy made me smile
5,2023-08-23 08:29:56,this is a fine game or to put it more bluntly games. I am believing that there are more than one game due to the fact that our mind needs several different ideas at bedtime for your mind to have several different items or ideas to think so your mind does not get stuck on just one thing so that idea does not get stuck and keeps us up at night. I believe that is the excellence of this app. Really Wise Even if at first you do not understand this.,Fine
5,2023-07-23 20:57:00,these games are fun to play easy to get sucked into and there’s is a variety of games to choose from the word guess game was soooo difficult but I was persistent and ended up getting the hang of it ! I recommend this app bc it’s a great way to get that daily brain exercise! The game will even give u a personalized set of daily brain teasers…(I am not consistent enough to actually make it apart of my schedule)  but there is a reminder option u can customize to any set time to remind you !,fun and challenging!
2,2023-08-13 16:54:20,I’ve only had the app for a few days and only got it because I had a gift card. I bought the year membership but I’ve yet to see if it’ll be worth it to pay for that long since I’ve only had it for about 5 days. So far though it’s been good and I think I may redeem next year (we’ll see). There’s a variety of tests and apps that seem worth it enough.  Update: the touch sensitivity is weird and unresponsive sometimes. I’ll be dragging my finger across the screen and the touch won’t register. It’s frustrating because it’ll make me restart sometimes. I’m going to check my phone settings but I don’t think that’s what it is.,It’s good
5,2023-03-21 16:38:14,"I added Impulse to my daily schedule to keep my brain sharp. The brain is a muscle and like our bodies we need to exercise it. The way I do it is by the practice techniques provided in this app. Try drinking more water as well so you can keep your muscle hydrated. In doing so, you’ll notice the change and you’ll feel the power and potential you have by trying this app and drinking a little more water. 💪🏻🎓✨🙌🏻.

3,2023-07-08 22:03:40,I like the app and the games. I really just likes the games and haven’t bothered with anything else. Soooo many ads. For the pop-up to pay $4.99 to remove ads and thought it was a good deal. Only to find out it was just for that one group. I wouldn’t have paid if I knew that. Thought it was for the whole app. There are a lot of levels but I would have at minimum chosen a different game to pay for. Now I have to play Connect the dots (which is only 300 levels). I would have chosen at least one with more levels and that I enjoyed more.,$4.99 to remove ads from 1 game type only
5,2022-05-01 01:23:04,I’m one of those people that rarely leaves reviews and I never ever purchase anything. But I bought this game and I’m glad I did. My father died from dementia and keeping my brain as sharp as possible is important. This is the most detailed and professional app I’ve ever seen. You’ll never get bored! They update it to keep it going with more added games.  P.s please bring back the original colors for candy sort. The colorblind option was a lifesaver but the new colors are very hard to recognize,Do it!
4,2022-10-13 03:16:20,"I was feeling focused and less distracted from my day to day thoughts due to this game so I am grateful to have come across this and it was quite fun to play but it can be free for users instead of having it paid for fun, as I sensed the free version was purposely made very easy to force the users to buy the paid version to enjoy the real fun of this game.  Thought of sharing my personal insight on this experience but at the end I am no one to tell you how to run your app so thanks for giving me the little fun I had in the free version 🙏🏼✌🏻",Impulse feedback from experience
5,2022-01-08 23:45:45,"I just started using this app a couple days ago and has been great so far!   Trying to work in a simple and attainable way to work my brain out a bit more.    The games are fun and I love the way you can customize your goals.   I have been doing 10 minutes a day which I find to be achieve able but there are others options with 20 minutes a day or even 5.   I like the additional puzzles, tests and games also.   Super cool and I’m trying to convince my husband to get it.",Fun App
5,2023-05-05 17:14:29,The fact that I won a discounted rate to continue the services for a year for only $.99 cents was AMAZING! I thank God for this Mental Game because it truly helped me during a time where I needed it the most! It helps me to stay focused and pay great attention to detail. It helps with your math skills and really improved my speech. I can take the things I learned from this game and use it in real life situations without even realizing it. So thank you to the creators of this fun and fulfilling game.,Best Memory Game Ever!
3,2020-03-16 05:34:38,"YOU GUYS... you cannot just delete an app that you have subscribed to and think it goes away... you have to actually go to subscriptions and cancel the subscription before the free trial period ends if that’s what you choose to do.   Anyway I downloaded this for the tower of Hanoi game. My complaint is that at level 14, it doesn’t move quickly when you tap it and instead it auto moves and you have to wait almost a minute to move the ring from one spot to another. This doesn’t make sense with a timed game. I would like to get to level 30 but can’t if it’s gonna be this slow. Is it a glitch?",Tower of Hanoi Level 14 Slowdown Glitch?

OMG the ads were nonstop.  Some of the ads have very adult themes which is odd for an app with a 4+ age rating (parents beware).  You can play a game that takes 15 seconds then have to wait through a 30 second ad for the next game.  Most sessions are 3 games long, so you have about 90 seconds of ads for 45 seconds to a minute of gameplay.  It became so frustrating I finally gave up.  Not worth the overall cost in my opinion for a phone game.",Soooo many ads-some not kid friendly
4,2023-06-21 06:59:20,"As with most brain training apps that charge for a subscription, this one is ad-filled without payment. I will say though...that the app's ""guide"" WILL let you know how to fast forward thru the ad to make it as time efficient as possible. Personally, still running app for free, I appreciate the stats offered after each game- telling you how well you do in comparison to peers. Other tests/quizzes are also offered; however, you don't get an official report or analysis of your scores unless you opt in for payment",Good but not great.
5,2023-10-22 16:08:11,"l just downloaded and I couldn’t be more satisfied. The cost is like $20 for a whole year worth of training, personalized tests, and puzzles. It’s definitely worth the money because it’s interactive, kid friendly, has in tests which has been my favorite so far. the only things i’m worried about is after finishing the thousands upon thousands of puzzles i hope i’m still able to find other things to do in the app but that would take years",TONS of content
