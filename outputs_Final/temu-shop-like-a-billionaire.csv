I have spent about $150 so far on Temu. I have loved everything so far except for one thing and I have probably bought 30 items. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of most things. Some were better than others but for the price I sure can’t complain. I will be back for sure. You can’t lose even if one thing turns out not so great because it is so inexpensive. The shipping is fast for what is probably coming from over seas. maybe a week or little more. They will text you a lot of times with updates on your order so you are never left in the dark wondering where your package is. I love getting a deal so Temu is my kind of place to shop. I recommend looking around on the site for the best deal because many times they will have it chеaper from a different seller I suppose because there are multiples of similar items. They also send you coupons sometimes. If you have friend who you can sign up you can get a lot of free stuff but I didn’t want to bother anyone. I like to wait til they send me a coupon to place an order. Try it you will like it. Warning most the time when they offer free gifts you are going to have to get friends to sign up and you will play games to get the points then you will need more points to win and you will need friends to sign up to actually win the prizes you have!!",Great prices and so many items to choose!
5,2023-10-16 03:14:44,"So i've been using temu for a little while now,and I can say it's pretty good really. It's really cheap,kind of like shein but a little better i guess? The gifts are legit,too. I got 15 dollars from playing on paypal but trust me it may take a while and you need a bunch of people unless you have a lot of friends. But overall,it's a good app. But you still have to be careful with some of the things in this Temu app because some people also get scammed or robbed. I'm not saying it's a bad app and you shouldn't get it because it's pretty good for a online shopping app tbh. I like the app but i think it should improve the little ""free gifts credit"" thingys because it is a little bit rigged. Yes,it may be a peramid scheme but i've never seen any better and almost every online shop does that right? But yeah,it's good! But please also be aware that the games are rigged like I said. Some of the games (or all tbh) have this trick that if you shared and got all the cutting prices then when you share and invite other people not only they lower the prices for you to have less time,but they give you only 1-3 days to finish. Now i'm not saying it's not that much or anything but still,it may take a while to do this because not that much people have a lot of friends like other people do. So they should really fix that and they are lucky I gave them 5 stars. (which i guess?? they deserve idrk). Have a great day!! Have a great day!!!!",Marvelous place to find almost anything your heart desires!
5,2023-10-16 03:12:48,"I’ve purchased lots of handy gadgets for my home and only had a couple that were cheaper than portrayed. I’m happy with Temu’s fast service too. I finally took a chance on some clothing and for the most part the items were like the photos, but there have been a couple of items that came in that have made me scared to buy clothing from them again without reading lots of reviews first. This new thing online of advertising a clothing item prototype then shipping something way different is really irritating. For instance in fashion how the fabric falls, the drape,a proper cut, fabric texture, and of course blending colors in the pattern are key to a beautiful item. A dress made out of cotton or a cotton blend will flow and drape more more flattering than a poly blend. So if the model is wearing a flowing caftan dress, generously cut but also more fitted in the bust (more complimentary), in a textured cottony fabric, in a vibrant color coordinated pattern, you know how that might look on you. But when you receive a similar item of thin shiny cheap material, cut very narrow not flowing, shorter in length and shorter sleeves, with a printed on pattern that has odd color combinations, you feel cheated. So far I have received 3 such items from Temu but I’ve also received 4 that were exactly as they were portrayed. As long as Temu stays true to not misleading shoppers with advertising one item and selling an inferior product I will remai",Wonderful store for acquiring whatever you need!

I've been using Temu for several months now and love it! It feels great to be able to buy almost anything on a whim because everything is so affordable. The quality of merchandise can vary a lot but I have been very impressed by a few items, like a cotton canvas purse that is thick, durable, washable, and looks great. My favorite items so far has been the neat little bucket washing machine that gets my socks and underwear cleaner than a regular washing machine and rechargeable motion sensor lights that detect day/night (that's a lot of cutting edge tech for $7.50!) These little inexpensive items improve your quality of life, like a drain hair catcher that saves me money on plumbers, a nice quality purse to replace an old one, car blind spot mirrors that can save my life, sanding discs fo repairing paint scratches on my car, dishwashing steel wool, adhesive hooks for jackets, clips that hold my shower curtain in place so it doesn't stick me uncomfortably, and several amazing Apple watch band knockoffs that look like the real thing and cost less than $10! It's being able to buy all these items that life starts to feel a little more affordable. They have great customer service and I literally couldn't ask for better!

5,2023-11-10 09:38:08,"There is finally a company that understands the economical struggles, and aspects of where we live for the majority of the populace , being poor to middle class. Temu offers wonderful and bountiful products. you need temu has it. You want it you’ll be hard-pressed that Temu doesn’t have it and so much more!and Temo does not have to have statement of we understand that is hard to get by in  today’s economy to get what you need let alone be able to get a little something that you want. All you have to do is look at the price and know that Temu gets us and expresses that understanding without saying a word, because they know it’s the dollar we’re looking for and the amount is price that reflects their understanding of the economy who the populace is that keeps it running. It is the working classes. Temu  struggles that come with the working class understands how economically hard it is for the working class.  Temu allows us the working class the strugglers to get the things we want and need for ourselves our children, and family family at very very affordable prices, and with those prices we can order almost like in bulk, but we need, if not most of it unlike other stores and online shopping at website store keep up the awesome work good quality products and you’ll have a repeat shopper until I cannot shop anymore",Love Temu because this company understands the working class.
5,2023-05-10 14:38:20,"Temu is very entertaining.  I drop in for a quick visit and end up staying.  Like most bargain shopping sites you have to pick carefully on items you are seriously wanting to use and go hog wild on the cheap fun stuff.  Be cause most items are relatively inexpensive it’s a great place for trying out stuff to see if it really works.  No biggy if it doesn’t and hurry and buy a bunch if it does.  What I do is go through and click buy on stuff I think I can’t live without then I go through and rethink and delete or keep.  Since I can’t order huge amounts of stuff I go through and pick some of what I want the most and order.  Then hopefully   I can order some more when I can afford it.  A lot of the items sell out pretty fast so you have to decide while they are available.  No pressure! Ha ha.  When I look at all the reviewers of Temu  on all the different sights and what they say I’m pretty impressed.  Just remember it’s still someone’s personal opinion, but it does give you an idea of what an item looks like on real people and how an item is used and what you probably shouldn’t buy. Ihave many things from Temu that I am happy with, many on a regular basis.  Just remember the choice is yours.  Today I am wearing a Temu dress, headband, bracelet, and steriling ring all purchase at low prices.  About $20 for it all, not bad. Have a great day!",So much to see……so little time
5,2023-07-27 22:15:04,"I learned about TEMU by accident recently, and first ordered a small fan to cool my laptop computer. It was very inexpensive and was sent postage paid. Next, I ordered an electronic kit to build an signal generator, which was also inexpensive and works as I expected it to do. Most recently I ordered an ac motor speed controller to slow down my Dremel tool. It came fully assembled, and works as described, Again it was sent postage paid. I also, on another order bought some electronic components, and last was a small boresight camera that I plan to use when cleaning my chimney. So far, every  purchase was postage paid, was in excellent condition as received, and all were at bargain prices. Only one arrived late, but it was only one day late, and I was given a $5 credit for that. The only complaints I have deal with information about the products on the internet, on their app, and included with the products. Often there is not a word of any kind to tell how to use it, though the camera did come with a foldout ""manual"" that gave what was needed to use it. And that required a magnifier for my old eyes to read it. Overall, that is minor, but I think TEMU will have more sales if it gives better descriptions on its website and included with the product when it is purchased.",TEMU is an excellent source of low cost items of quality.
3,2023-09-04 18:44:11,"Ok so I started using Temu and have gotten quite few items. Quality is ok some are cheap, some are actually good. The deals are just ok. They offer coupons and discounts but I notice they also raise the price when you are using a coupon (I notice everything)  As for the stupid games that gives you “free stuff” farmland, fish land and the others are purely a fake. Towards getting close to finally getting your gifts, they raise to even .01 % for every feed. Meaning you need more food or water to complete 100%. I added users and also made a purchase to get 600K in fish food and those 600k didn’t even get one fish to 100% so I think they only do it to keep people buying more and inviting users but to get to finally get the “free gift” will come harder and harder. I read the rules and they can even come to 0.01 cents contribution! I’ve been in .07 cents away from my gift for a month and finally now it’s only .05 cents. Wow I won’t spent months trying for this. So TEMU please change that and if you offer a free gift then do it, don’t fool people around by having to feed fishes or water for the rest of your life to get a gift in about 50 years from now.  Aside from that, returns have been ok, no hassle that way, delivery is also good and ok timing. They provide with tracking info and it’s helpful. I would pay close attention to the prices and when they offer you a “discount”  Don’t fall for the games, it’s a waste of time","Products and deals ok, Games are not ok"
4,2023-05-11 06:34:26,"I’ve been pleasantly surprised with my shopping experience at Temu and only have a couple of suggestions.   I have purchased a number of clothing items through the app and have found discrepancies between the material description listed for a few items versus the actual material found on the tag once I received the items.  When I made Temu aware of my disappointment,  I have to acknowledge they were more than happy to provide me with a full refund, very promptly.  Hopefully they will be more attentive to making this information accurate.  Secondly, when trying to find a pair of cargo shorts by waist size, many times the size shown (S30 for example) is not really a 30 inch waist.  When you tap on the S30, the app brings up additional sizing information and I have seen waist sizes ranging between 28 and 32 as the actual waist measurement for the S30 size option.     I do realize that international sizing can be rather inconsistent and that Temu may not be able to do anything about this issue.  I would just have to suggest that you be careful to determine your correct size when ordering clothing.  Lastly, and this is just a personal preference for myself, I wish that Temu had more boys/mens cargo shorts available in a smaller waist size (28-29 inches) that also have a button closure.  Thank you for reading my review, I hope you find Temu to be a good shopping experience!",A Little Refinement Will Bring Me To 5 Star

Only question, WHY does it take sooooo long to win •all 5 items •as stated . I have to say, I’ve shopped about  a dozen times. All these •fish land • games are eating my data. I have been stuck on this last .02 cents I PROMISE I’ve been playing it daily since around September, definitely October 🎯 yet I get this close then y’all put a time restriction on it after I played the game for months, daily. How can u allow us to Win all 4 prizes in less than 4 minutes but takes MONTHS to •feed the fish• then it expires 👎👎👎 the frustration, aggravating to work on it for months to have it swept out in front of u😂😂😂😂😂😂😂insanity!!!!!! Cause after all that , I still love to shop. Just would be nice to actually receive the FREE items . Y’all think I’m lying, check it out when the tell u pick 5 items , then share,,, EVERY-TIME they tell u to spin always hit the X button on top right. U DONT have to share , hit the X instead of sharing, IT STILL GIVES you the coins, pearls… u can take the total all the way down to 1.00 then ur stuck.. don’t believe me, try it !!!

5,2023-09-29 20:41:36,"I have ordered my lines from other online company’s for my catfish and bass rod and reels that I refurbish and resell, but this was my first time using Temu. The ads were very informative and the pics shown are exactly what the lines they sent look like, what was the icing on the cake was no shipping costs involved. So I ordered 2 reels of line, 1 orange for my catfish reels and gray for my bass reels. Spooling them on today and excited about first fishing trip using them. So far Very pleased with the ordering, shipping & the emails with updates as to delivery dates and other deals with the same types of line I had ordered. I will be ordering from Temu again seeing that I refurbish reels and always offer them with new braid already installed. Great results so far from Temu, looking forward to buying from them again Dan Update on this review I spooled the orange 20 pound braid on one of my catfish reels, tried it out to see if handled and casted good. Results did not catch a catfish but did catch and reel in to the dock so I could release it was a 20 pound plus soft shell turtle, this one had a neck as thick as my left fore arm, and the line did outstanding results. What Temu says in the description about this braid was spot on. In fact so pleased with it I ordered 4 more colors of this braid, this will be on all the reels I refurbish and resell.",First order
5,2022-11-25 22:26:08,"So I did not have high expectations for this app. However, the items that I have purchased have been really well made and good quality. I have purchased so far, a bread shaped eyeshadow palette, a beanie, creature bookmark, hair clip. They were all awesome.  Before purchasing I made sure to read reviews and would not buy the item without seeing pictures that people have uploaded during their review. I think that really helped me to get good quality products. I have made another larger purchase since then. Just waiting to receive it. The  first order arrived in less than two weeks, so my second order should arrive in a week or so. That being said, there are some items I don’t know if I would purchase just because I don’t have the extra money to spend  to have it not work or be the quality I wanted to, so I definitely think it’s a great day. I will continue buying from the app. Black Friday Shipping currently is free which I absolutely love. I’m super stoked for my next order to arrive..  some people have compare this to “Wish” which maybe there are items that would be comparable. For me, so far with what I have received, I definitely think that Temu is much better and shipping is quick in comparison.",Exceeds expectations so far!
4,2023-10-06 04:54:15,"Don’t get me wrong I LOVE Temu and I have placed SEVERAL orders(atleast once a week) BUT I have been playing the fishland and farmland games for literally MONTHS now and on fishland I have been down to $0.01 for almost a month to get my free stuff and while they give you certain amounts of fish food per day when you first start playing the food feeds the fish FAST but when you start getting to where you are about to earn your free stuff the amount of time you have to spend playing, or money buying stuff just to get free food you may as well just buy the stuff you are trying to get for free! And we all know that it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to share with a “new user” bc of the fact that the app is already out there and popular! So to me it isn’t really fair to make us spend a ton of money to get items for free when the prices are so cheap we may as well just buy the stuff! Plus they only give you free fish food certain times of day and if you don’t catch it then you won’t get it and seeing as how we are adults and have jobs it is also nearly impossible to get the free food! Then the fact that they don’t send you the “match” challenge until you are already almost out of food! Challenges should be easier and cheaper seeing as how I’m sure this app already makes PLENTY of money off of their products!",Ask too much to earn free stuff
3,2023-06-28 10:39:25,"Don’t fall for there free items. , fake advertisement! Temu will require you to send out a bunch of invites and it gives you points towards your free items but it makes you pick 5 or 10 items and you can only win them by getting enough points or money cut off for all of them. When I got to the end 8 points away I had to invite one more person every time I invited someone the points needed stayed the same. I contact customer service they said the people you invite need to down load the app and participate in a free event. If they don’t use your link or already customers then it won’t count. Even though every time I sent a link and shared it I got points / money towards the free items until it was almost filled I mean like 95% done. So beware of that or will waste your time and effort for nothing . It’s a false advertisement loop hole at its best.! When it says spin this to claim a reward then says you have won 5 free items pick it , after you pick the you have to pay with sharing your invite link and make sure they sign up and probably then they still won’t give you it it will come up with another stipulation like you need spend this amount in store to receive free items then charge shipping by telling you you need to invite 5 more people and not let you pay shipping your self, so you tell me is that a scam? …",If something seems to good to be true it usually is. There’s no free items
4,2023-09-17 17:44:16,"I would like to start off by saying that I like Temu. Prices change on a regular basis. You can get your money back if something goes on sale once you have purchased it. I have won free gifts for playing games but once you win the chances of winning again get higher. They always want you to invite when we only know so many people. They should give you more credit for being a regular customer and repeat purchaser. Not to mention the number of times you have shared. The coupons run out to fast and some are for amounts that most people wouldn’t even spend at one time. Therefore they become no use. If you are like me I was skeptical about ordering for the 1st time and wouldn’t place an order for a long time and once I did I placed a very small order (under $20) to be on the safe side. That’s over 2 hours of work I was willing to take a chance on. Some of the items are good quality with good prices and others are very cheap quality and not worth it. I believe they need better descriptions actual photos without edits to be posted and a photo when item is in edit form or fluffed etc to show its potential giving insight on how many was used to get the same effect. I prefer cotton clothing and it’s very difficult for me to find. Need photos of front , back and both sides.",How I feel about the app
4,2023-02-09 01:54:16,"It is better than Wish, quality-wise, though some of the items are the same. It feels like AliExpress but you get your order in less than 10 days (my first one came in 7) as opposed to 1-2 months. I AM glad I gave it a try and hope I don’t blow all my expendable income on it because, while there are a few things I need, most of it is just stuff I want. They do honor the initial 90% off gift and if you have time to play their popularity/annoy your friends game, you can get some great deals. The coupons don’t last long enough at all. The other day I had a $16 off $40 coupon but it expired in 24 hours when I was still building my next cart, so I find myself waiting to make the purchase until I receive a good coupon. I have tried the referral thing to win free items and credits but I’m lame and antisocial so I don’t know enough people and I also don’t have the time to peruse reddit for hours looking for strangers to “click for click” with. It makes me a little frustrated (and obviously just jealous) when I see people who have received 100+ free gifts they’re going to resell just because they are kids with no jobs and spend their days being “influencers” on tik tok-In that regard it feels like a tween’s app, but again, I’m just lame so you may have better luck with the whole “Team Up Price Down” thing.",Legit & Addictive
4,2023-10-02 15:59:15,"Had some issues with an order- I was sent someone else’s order. There was no problem getting my order refunded and they let me keep the other that was sent to me so I didn’t have to hassle with a return at all. But the refund was issued as a TEMU credit. I would have preferred they just sent me my original order or sent the money back to my debit card. The only other issue I’ve had is with a third party shipper that they used- Lazer Ship, that company is trash. Had so many issues getting my package and their customer service is literally non existent. There’s a button you click to reach someone on their website, which is a total lie. Your message goes nowhere, nobody reads it. I understand that isn’t TEMU or their company, just warning anyone that has to use them for their packages. They are awful. Again, I am overall satisfied with my shopping experience. Do not be scammed by the games- farmland and fish land seem like fun ways to win or earn free products or coupons but the closer you get to the goal, the harder they get to reach. Very time consuming and all the “free gift” boxes they tell are exclusive to you, are not. The prices never change. It’s just consumer manipulation and again, just a waste of time. Stuff is still super cheap and you get what’s advertised. Still worth using",Overall satisfied
3,2023-09-18 14:29:32,"I absolutely love temu. Their prices are out of this world affordable, and their products are actually good quality unlike some other online shop pining websites. But what I don’t understand is how they make it a 10$ minimum for orders because they want to conserve how much plastic they use, but at the same time they cover they entire thing with tape! I also don’t understand that if you have credit and you have enough to get a free item why you can’t just get that item that is under 10$ and not have to add something else? It would be amazing if you guys could change that policy or at least make it that once a week you don’t have to do a 10$ minimum and that there is no minimum. Other than those two things it’s a great app and I definitely recommend if your looking for some cheap home decor or cute jewelry and clothes!   Edit:  The games that are suggesting it’s easy to win a couple free items as well are totally not worth it. I don’t recommend wasting your time on a game trying to get a free item when it is literally impossible to win them. Temu does not give you even a close amount enough of food to be able to feed your fish or water your grass to win the items so instead of trying to get a free Nintendo switch or cargo pants just buy it or wait until you ACTUALLY notice the price went down.",Don’t understand the 10$ minimum
5,2023-09-20 03:57:29,I love this app so much. I cannot believe that all these sellers are on here and sellers such great products at great prices too. I know some cannot use the app but for those who can it is even easier in the app and you can do so much on here. It’s not some store app that is boring it is exciting and they seem to update it all the time. This is my first year shopping with Temu and I am just wondering who thought up this wonderful app and what took so long???  I think everyone needed a store they could shop with and get amazing offers for some really amazing items. I had a issue with a couple of my orders and I must say it was even easier in here then it would have been on the phone. Also I ended up getting connected to a woman banned carrie and she helped me tremendously. They made good for the trouble I went through and in the end everything worked out. All these sellers on here selling direct I love it. I also especially love the games I as of late have according to my husband become addicted to winning lol. I just have to spend a very small amount of time winning items and well I’ve gotten so many people in My family And friends circle on this app. They love it just as much. Thank you Temu.,Where have you been ask my life???

1,2023-09-02 03:11:08,They probably won’t let me put screen shots but if you come by a lady names Gail on customer service and even send screen shots supporting your issue she will completely go around the actual problem. I’ve had two issues with being shorted on the side games where you can get (FREE) stuff supposedly. Funny how I get a price adjustment and my side game completely freezes saying I got refund on my orders which I didn’t. That lady never fixed my issue just tried giving me a coupon to shut me up. Then I finally unfreeze my account my self placing an order to replace the 200g they took back for my order and I’m now not getting my whole grams like I should. Funny because I’m super close to getting my free items. so I ended up with Gail in customer service lady with my current issue and she’s completely going around my issue even though my screen shots clearly show that it says ten grams and then shows I only received 1 gram she starts babbling about how I can get grams of water. Like no lady the game is not giving me my full grams. Then try’s to tell me that you can’t harvest plants on fish land and I screen shot her that you indeed can. Needless to say she said I wasn’t responding to her after I gave a rating of 1 on the chat because she was no help and she ended the conversation. Temu was great up until it wasn’t. Deleting app after my last orders come in. If what I’m paying is funding her job I’ll gladly stop funding it.,Had an issue and it wasn’t resolved 2 times in one day.

A pain with extra clicks just to find anything. A cppl days ago it was suddenly back to how it used to be which was awesome! Now it's back to the 🤬 way. Just put it back & leave it alone!! I look at reviews for everything & used to make reviews but no more bc if you do a review from then on it adds another step to click on to see price adjustments etc. Stop ""fixing"" something that's NOT broke!!  #3 - When it takes near 1000g & over 3wks to get a fish from 70% to 100% y'all are getting beyond ridiculous! My 1st rnds of Farmland & Fishland when placing an order that was, say, $32 I purposely added $8 to make it a $40 order to get 800g. Now that I've realized once you get down to 2 fish / 2 wheats 800g is nothing I'll save my $8! ** For anyone that hasn't played the stupid games just know when you FINALLY win you have like 48hrs to place a $100 order to be able to use the $40 off coupon you spent gawd knows how long winning. Btw, you have the same 48hrs to place another $100 order to use $30 off coupon. So if you don't have $130 total to spend on 2 separate orders within 48hrs of winning just forget about the coupons you ""won"".","""Your Orders"" page 👎 WISHLIST MOVED"
5,2023-05-04 00:31:56,"I've been using Temu for several months now and love it! It feels great to be able to buy almost anything on a whim because everything is so affordable. The quality of merchandise can vary a lot but I have been very impressed by a few items, like a cotton canvas purse that is thick, durable, washable, and looks great. My favorite items so far has been the neat little bucket washing machine that gets my socks and underwear cleaner than a regular washing machine and rechargeable motion sensor lights that detect day/night (that's a lot of cutting edge tech for $7.50!)  These little inexpensive items improve your quality of life, like a drain hair catcher that saves me money on plumbers, a nice quality purse to replace an old one, car blind spot mirrors that can save my life, sanding discs fo repairing paint scratches on my car, dishwashing steel wool, adhesive hooks for jackets, clips that hold my shower curtain in place so it doesn't stick me uncomfortably, and several amazing Apple watch band knockoffs that look like the real thing and cost less than $10! It's being able to buy all these items that life starts to feel a little more affordable. Thank you Temu for helping people's paychecks stretch a little further!",Love this app!
1,2023-05-05 14:29:47,"I have been using this app for a while, however I have had many issues with the quality of these clothes. I bought a pair of sweatpants and as they arrived they looked nothing like the pictures. They had a strange seam line going down them, which wasn’t on the picture. Oh well, I’ll just contact them. I was given a refund, no problem, however I was still a little upset with the situation as it left a bad taste in my mouth. So, I go ahead and make another purchase, buying two pairs of pants and a shirt. The shirt was poor quality, but it was pretty cheap, so I was not too mad. But the pants were the problem. I received a pair of jeans that were blue and looked NOTHING like the picture.  And as I opened the package, I discovered they were WET. They were in the package in a secure plastic bag, so I have no idea how they were wet. I can’t imagine it was a shipping issue, because nothing else was wet. And the other pair of pants I received looked nothing like the imagine. Angry with what I received, I contact Temu about the two pairs of pants. And they told me there was nothing I could do without a refund. Here’s the thing - I don’t think I should be forced to use my gas money (I do not live near a postal box) to return my LOW QUALITY items that are NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE of them while they’re wet!!! This is a horrible business. I’ve recommended so many people to this app, but these Temu does not care. I am BEYOND angry with this experience and in disbelief.",HORRIBLE experience
1,2023-06-24 21:58:32,"They advertise profusely using prices that are a fraction of the real price, sometimes with a notation only for new customers (but usually not). But even new customers don’t get that price as they will say the item doesn’t qualify even though you clicked thru the ad to get to the exact item they advertised. If you don’t buy the ridiculously overpriced junk they were hawking, they will keep showing you new item prices for other items at a fraction of their true cost, but then say you are ineligible to receive the discount because your not a new customer. They will continue to show these prices on every item and won’t honor the price. The real price is typically about 10x that price, for inferior quality goods with slow shipping and using mail fraud in order exploit a niche in postal rates. This makes the goods effectively non-returnable. Product pictures are frequently altered and aren’t the real product. They also sell your info to anyone and everyone and won’t delete your account even though you’ve instructed them to, opening you up being hacked. Months later and I am still being sent verification codes for an account that I asked to be deleted and all info purged.

And, the classic saying “you get what you pay for” applies here, as it does everywhere. Be smart. If you want high quality clothes, don’t buy them here. If you want beginner art supplies to try stuff out, or stamps, or trinkets or tools or hair stuff - and can wait 10-14 days - give it a whirl. Think online dollar store quality stuff. Know what you’re getting yourself into. Just made my first larger priced purchase, so I’m interested to see how if the quality increases as the prices increase.   I’ve been surprised at how well things arrive given the distance and wrapping - which is basically just a heavy plastic bag - but even glass things have come intact so far. And they’ve arrived within the guaranteed delivery window every time. I’m also a fan of the price adjustment option, which gives you store credit if prices go down within a window after purchase.

However, Temu is outrageously cheap about the “games”,”coupons/discounts”, and “rewards” they promote. You can spend all the time you want playing along but you will never actually get to a collection that meets the reward requirements. You can share and send out links but all the sudden you’re not advancing the same. You start getting only fractions of what you did before. Which is okay considering maybe days from now I’ll get the 0.35 cents I need left and then I can unlock the whole set up. GUESS WHAT THEY RESTART THE GAME PROGRESS and there’s no way to avoid it. Almost like they don’t want you to actually win anything?🤔 which is why they compensate all the data mining you sign up for with actual products….oh wait they still get all my info and I get absolutely nothing. Hmmmm sounds like a bargain cause you don’t get any of that time you spent checking in for “water”,”fish food”, or “stars”.

You can't see a small item you like and get it for a couple dollars, you're forced to spend $20 every. Single. Time. You want something. Which means you're forced to buy a bunch of stuff you don't actually want, or you have to wait forever until you have $20 worth of stuff you want. So it'll be months before you get your stuff... Recently they've also stopped accepting returns from me. They make me send the item back, where they used to let me keep the product and give me my money back in the form of credit. I understand why they'd want the items back, but that's just going to turn me away. Items here are extremely hit or miss. 50% of what you buy is nothing at all like the item description. I'm not going to the post office every time I need a return. That's so annoying. Plus it costs me money to get the box and packing materials, probably more money than the product itself!

I’ve noticed a pattern in the automated-sounding reviews, because they are all titled the same thing. Despite them being different, they all sound like they are sent from one singular person because the writing style is the same. All the reviews are structured very alike, and the usernames are fake. I hope you actually soak in this review instead of replying with some automated response. I hope you realize this is a serious matter, because it is illegal to give yourself reviews. The FTC comes after businesses that do this, and if you don’t quit it now, I’ll make sure they hear of it. I’m not trying to be rude or shut down your business, this is for your own good.  Hi Temu! I’ve come back to check on your reviews, and it seems you’ve taken my advice. I haven’t seen one fake review anymore. Thank you. I just need to mention- the app is good enough so you don’t have to fake reviews. The company is already TT famous. To everyone who reads this- get the app. No substantial money can be lost on cheap items because not much was paid anyways. Another thank you, Temu.

Since babies grow so fast, I can’t justify spending a lot of money on their clothes.  But getting like to all the pro’s about Temu, their prices are affordable, the order’s always comes before the delivery date they give me and returns are easy and are never questioned. Occasionally, if something is damaged, they will ask for pictures which makes total sense to me. Yes, some of their things are cheaply made but I’ve never had a problem with those things because, for me, they were silly signs I was hanging outside anyway and no sign outside last forever unless you paid big bucks for it and sometimes they don’t last either.  My only con would be the packaging is not the best and you most likely won’t be able to return an item in it. I always save my smaller boxes for situations like this. Temu will email you a mailing label and returns are always free.  So thank you Temu for being such a great company for me. I really appreciate the affordable prices, quick deliveries and easy free returns even when it’s my fault. ❤️",Great item at a bargain

I have had absolute success on receiving all my orders, in good condition, now I normally wouldn’t buy out of the country because of my experiences before, like taking 2 to 4 months to receive something. However a couple of weeks isn’t bad at all , that I can do! Almost everything has been great , I’ve decided that the woman’s clothes with a few exceptions just don’t work for me. I enjoy the daily gift box with credit, I don’t like being rushed to hurry and close my purchases in fear of my items running out , it causes me to make mistakes on my orders, like doubling and tripling the same items.

It’s a good app, you do get your stuff for a cheap price but you have to have at-least $5 worth of items to do so. The most irritating thing about Temu is the “free gifts.” It’s constantly trying to give me free stuff, and it always gives me the best reward EVEN when I press the X to leave. It always gives you the best gift but practically makes it impossible to get it. It also lied to me and said I would get 30 points for inviting a knew person, and I only got 10! They also constantly notify you of “deals” that arnt real, even after I turned notifications off for this app. Along with farmland, they made it really easy to get wheat in the beginning but once the end started to come it got really hard. It went from giving me around 30% of the wheat grown with one water to only giving me .11% for each drop of water! It’s making me really upset because I had 195 water to use on my plant and it’s the LAST ONE.

Click on the reviews and what you will see are reviews for a whole bunch of items, not just the item your looking at.  Second, start reading the reviews.  Countless reviews are clearly negative, yet it shows that the person gave the item 5 stars which is impossible.  Simply put, this is fraud and needs reported to Apple so their app is removed from the store.  After reading the reviews, it is very clear that their “review” grading system is a lie as well.  Further, when you double check that the things I am writing are true (and they are), report it to your attorney general.

I seriously recommend it. you can do giveaways, which can give you free items that you don’t even have to pay for, and it helps me and my family. not only that, whenever I got my package  it came at the right time. It told me it was going to come on dec 15 and it said that if it was late will give me a five dollar credit off my next order. My package also came with a little surprise, with it also coming quick.

They’ll have you thinking it’s attainable and it just isn’t. Here’s an example: I just started Farmland today. While a large chunk of the price of items is gone, everything else about it is a scam. Stating “up to $2 per wheat” (you won’t understand that until you’re in it and see it for yourself). Not once have I received $2 per wheat. Same with Fishland. As you go through it the value reduces significantly. They’re only removing .05 CENTS every time I “make a move” in Fishland. That’s not getting items for Free as suggested by Temu. That’s being forced to do menial, time wasting tasks while they mine information, under the disguise of “free”. I couldn’t give it a single star because I do enjoy the prices. But don’t assume you’ll get free items when they tell you that you will.  Update: October 2023 I have permanently deleted Temu. Account, the app, etc. All my family will be following suit.

Long story short, it is now the 3rd of January. I have contacted them almost everyday since the 27 because there hasn’t been a single update to shipping since the 24th.

I have asked for my money back multiple times, and have been told to wait an additional 15 days, and if I don’t receive an update to the tracking by then, they will refund my money.

The great thing about the return process was they gave me a credit for the items (I was able to get a credit toward my next purchase or, they credit my debit card) the are so reasonably priced & everything was such a good quality & did not look cheap. The jewelry was amazing many rings I ordered were either sterling silver, platinum or 14 carat gold filled & it’s crazy because I paid less the. $5 for each item.

I am sure with Christmas coming it will slow up a bit but it puts some of my domestic subscription boxes to shame for shipping times, I am not even kidding you. I timed a certain subscription box I get with a Temu order I did that sent the same day and I received the Temu order 2 days before the subscription box. Wild!!!!. I can not say enough good stuff about Temu. I have had 4-5 shipments and nothing has come damaged. One box it came in looked sad and I was wondering because items are usually loose, but nope everything was happy and safe inside. Some of the items inside were in their own puffy pouch too. So it depends.  As is now I have nothing negative to say! I have not had to deal with customer service yet. So I don’t know how well that goes.

It’s well worth the experience and getting things for affair, sometimes ridiculous price as cheap as they are.","At first, I was skeptical, thinking about Wish or other apps"
5,2023-07-12 09:04:53,"I wasn’t going to jump on the Temu train but I had some creator friends who I trust with reviews share their hauls and I had to try them out myself. I am so glad I did!!! Let’s start with the “cons” though…the shipping is a bit confusing. Because some items have to be cleared through customs, orders may be separated in the delivery process which can be harder to track. I am not a fan of the coupon codes or giveaway sales pitches, they just give the wrong vibe and Temu is fine without needing to use so many selling ploys. And the clothes run small.  Now the pros!! Shipping was actually really good!!! Everything arrived on time and since I signed up to get delivery alerts, I was kept informed throughout the entire process. The prices are unbelievable and unbeatable and the quality is AMAZING!!!! I am extremely pleased!!! I love the lightning deals!!! Even though the clothing runs small, they provide a chart so you are able to find the perfect size, so anyone getting the wrong size didn’t use the chart!   I am a Temu fan!!!! Thanks Temu for the great products, trustworthy shipping, and fabulous prices!!! 🥰",Honestly surprised!!!
5,2023-05-27 20:50:17,"I’ve been buying from this app for over a month. So far I’ve had absolutely no problem with any of the products. I purchased tools for miniatures I purchased craft and art supplies. I purchased electronic gadgets and I’ve purchased household items. Everything has been exactly as I expected. Everything has been delivered within the timeframe that they’ve told me it would be actually they’ve been delivered the first day of their estimate when shipment even arrived early, I get no annoying ads I get no request to invite other people to download the app for bonuses. Nothing like that. The only mistake I’ve seen so far is that I had ordered 10 S hooks and they shipped me five I called customer support and they are re-shipping the missing five hooks no needing to make this shipment up to $10. No shipping charge no questions the woman I talk to was very professional and cheerful overall I am extremely happy with this site. The quality is better than I expected. I had used wish before and gotten totally scammed, so needless to say, I’ve been pleasantly surprised with my experience with Temu.",Love this app
5,2022-11-25 21:24:52,"So I was very skeptical about this app when my fiancée told me about it. I thought it was just going to be like another Wish where your items break 2 minutes later and it takes like three months or more to get your items. I don’t know how but somehow the prices are even cheaper than wish but the products are better quality. And the part I love the most is every few hours you can get free shipping on your entire order. And delivery is very quick. They usually ship your item out the day after or two days after you place the order and depending on where you live it usually gets to you within a week or so. We have like four orders each that we ordered on different days and we’ve already gotten 3 of the packages. I am very pleasantly surprised you’re not only with their items, but with the shipping. Also, my fiancée got the wrong color of something and they very quickly gave her a credit to get the other color within three minutes and as soon as it was about to ship. Very fast and friendly customer service! Love you TEMU!!!",Very pleasantly surprised!
4,2023-06-12 22:41:59,"Most of my purchases have been as expected, I have ordered quite a lot and try to always check the sizes before I buy to prevent dissatisfaction, so I shop wisely. Some of the items exceed my expectations of quality and most others are at what I expected. I have an order with a pair of leggings coming and it will be my first clothing purchase, so at this time I can’t comment on clothing. I have ordered diamond art and have been very happy. My makeup purchases have been above what I hoped for. I don’t order large or electronic items, I am not much of a risk taker. I did just get a electronic bark stop device for my insane barker Yorkie dog. I am not expecting success but will let you know later, instructions say up to 2 weeks to work. My biggest complaint would be a lot of the products instructions are not in English or are very poorly written and just contain no instructions at all, but I know for the prices I am paying I feel it is what should be expected and some frustration is going to be part of the game. Also the low prices are enticing me to spend too much! LOL, my own fault. Over all I am happy with your company",Quality of purchases
5,2023-04-24 22:27:39,"I got this app a few months ago, and now I'm addicted. Everything on here is so cheap, and all the time, Temu launches a big sale, some coupons, or even free gifts altogether. Some of their items can be a little sketchy, but as long as you're careful, you're practically guaranteed great products for the cheapest price out there.  What I've heard about Temu recently is completely the opposite from what I've personally experienced. All the products I've received have good quality, or at least acceptable for the price. I've only ever had one package come late, and when it did, they reimbursed me $10! Extremely rarely, you may find an item or two missing, but it's never anything detrimental.  While you may find something missing, or maybe an item doesn't work, you can still apply for a refund. In my case, they gave me a full refund and allowed me to keep the items, and I could donate it as I pleased! They have great customer service and I literally couldn't ask for better! Thank you Temu for the great products and cheap prices!",Never shopping anywhere else again!

I love that I can get decent quality stuff for low prices. I've spent quite a lot because so many things are so cheap. Temu is smart because they use games where you can win products or store credit, to keep you coming back. (Instead of buying a bunch of stuff once and then never using the app again.) Even smarter, the games often require you to complete tasks like browse for thirty seconds, make purchases, or interact with existing users or recommend new users. Here's the issue. They made the games ridiculously easy to win for the first few months, even without referring a new user, and EVERYONE was cashing out. Then they changed all of the games to be rigged so that you can't win without recommending someone new. But a lot of the games pretend to be chance/luck based. Spin the wheel types, but it's not really luck or chance at all. It's obviously calculated to be unwinnable and it's really frustrating and a bit insulting. I wish they would make the games ACTUALLY chance based, even if that means offering smaller prizes. The way they do it now makes them seem really skeevy and scammy, and damages the trust of their users.",Great shop BUT
1,2023-10-15 17:26:17,"Played this game for about 3 months, started playing because of the puzzles it starts out easy with just a small commitment each day. Not even super fun, but then I joined an alliance and started making friends in the game. I never spent money in the game and for to level 27 before deciding I had to quit. It takes more and more of your time and gets super addictive, till all you want to do is play. Each level is more difficult to achieve without spending real money, although you can play and have fun as long as you're part of an active alliance. You will end up paying with time instead of money. There is strategy involved, but you'll never reach where you want to be when vou reach on goal there's another just out of reach. The game also has a steep learning curve, if you decide to really play you'll spend hours trying to figure out generals, buff, debuffs, research, ghosting, battlefield, server vs server, and everything else. There's always more to do to compete. I'll say I enjoved while I played I made lots of friends had a great server, but in the end it took too much of my time so be aware what you're signing up for.

When i wished to checkout and place the order, I clicked on one of the credit cards that I had on file and a message from Temu popped up and said I and my financial company(who was that?) were disputing Temu charges so Temu was making changes to my account. I checked with my credit card companies and there was no such dispute. I and my credit card companies weren’t disputing anything. My credit number is 812! Meanwhile Temu sent me several messages saying the merchandise I wanted was selling out and that I should place the order. I tried, and they wouldn’t process the order. I tried contTEMU AND IT WAS A BAD JOKE. THEy kept asking ne what the order number was. I didn’t have an order number because Tenu wouldn’t process the order. So I am done with them.

5,2022-10-06 23:54:12,"Just purchased 14 items for $12, so we’ll see what the actual price points are like after the new user discount disappears. Seems similar to AliExpress, but with better shipping time, smaller range of products and competitive prices. Two things to be mindful of: 1, There is no favorites or wishlist option. If you want to save something, you have to put it in your cart. You do have the option of selecting and buying just one item, but there’s also the option of sleepily emptying the cart or purchasing everything when you’re just trying to do one of two items. 2, The ratings when you click on a product seem to be for the entire store. When I clicked the reviews to read others opinions, they were filled with other items, to the point that I never saw the item I was looking for in any of the review sections. Will try to remember to come back and update rating based on the quality of the products. I’m not expecting top-notch quality, but I would like to get a few uses out of each item before it possibly breaks.",Pretty good so far
5,2023-03-29 19:33:42,"I have to say of course I was skeptic like everyone else but I also happily once ordered off of Wish so I expected honestly nothing special. I was wrong. I ordered twice now from Temu and both times the product I ordered was exactly as described and I personally couldn’t be happier with the products I ordered. This second time I really really didn’t expect my order ( especially a 4-6 piece order) to be delivered in less then a week. I leave for a trip in less then 15 hours and wanted to take my items with me and am estatic they came in time! Honestly, I recommend this to anyone who like me wants to be able to actually be able to shop for items comfortably price range wise. Before the  pandemic was honestly the last time I was able to even think about shopping for anything that wasn’t 100% essential. It really is a nice feeling to get some new clothes that actually fit me and won’t set me back 5 paychecks to catch back up to where I was. Honestly, thank you Temu.

HOWEVER with apps like these it’s safe to assume if it seems too good to be true it probably is. I don’t expect any of the items I got to be that high quality given the price and how these business models work. I would like to warn y’all of the “Freebies” they offer where you go through hoops to spins prize wheels, get energy (through inviting others), and then take a random chance to spin again for the prizes. It says you can invite 3 peo and it’s up to 2 energy per person but what they don’t tell you is the amount of energy you earn goes down with every person. They give you enough energy to get everything but one price on the wheel preventing you from winning all 3 things free. It leaves you 5 energy short and asks to invite others. The first person you invite gives 2 energy, (dope only 2 more invites and I can win my free stuff) but nah. The second invite gave me 1, then .5, then .2. Definitely a scam to get you to raise their downloads and users and I personally will be deleting it once I receive whatever it is I bought.",Honestly too good to be true

I have ordered several times and literally not one  single order has came where something wasn’t missing, broke, and one of my orders the whole entire order said it was delivered but not to me they delivered it to my address just in a different city about 5 hours from my actual house. The one thing about temu that gets on my nerves is the rigged games. I’m really starting to believe they are lying about real people actually winning these “free gifts” and whatnot . The games are literally rigged to where no one is going to win and the one time where some how I managed to actually win the $50 credit they didn’t give it to me In the game I had to go back and forth with customer service about it and thankfully I screen record everything and was able to show them that I won and then they had no choice but to give it to me.

They didn’t not just give me the option to take it as temu credit but told me afterwards that I had to ask before they proceed keeping mind I did, also it hasn’t been processed because it said the it will take up to 5-14 businesses days for the refund so it be processed, and then up to 30 days so I can receive my money back. After I spoke to 2 agents + 1 specialist they said it has already been processed and that it’s up to my bank when I receive the money. They said it would take DAYS but out of the nowhere when I ask if it would just be changed into credit they said it’s been processed in minutes? I have screenshots of the conversation, people should read at least some of the terms and conditions on things like the refund policy. It hasn’t even been half of the 30 days policy for me to get a refund, and it took like 15 minutes for me to get a refund so I don’t want the “you’re too late” excuse. I followed every rule and same as the policies but they send a random message “repeating” what they said about the order refund, but didn’t repeat they just changed the whole thing on which I was promised.",Changed policy mid conversation
5,2022-11-27 17:38:33,I was very skeptical of this site. I'm not a risk taker. But I was board and thought I'd start small and just purchase a few items. Well that turned into 3 hours of shopping in the comfort of my cozy home. My first order was 5 identical Christmas outfits for my preschool class. The deal was amazing and the picture of the outfit was soooooo darling. The total was $30. I was prepared to be disappointed. When I opened that package I felt and seen the outfits. I was in LovE!!!! They are the cutest!!!! I'm so excited to gift them. The next day I got my big order of about 40 random things. My daughter and I made a game out of it. First let me tell you this is the daughter that yells at me for buying junk or over priced items on Facebook . So she was in full mode ready to laugh at me!!! We opened and took one item out at a time. Said if it was quality or junk and then I made her guess the price I paid. She guessed higher on most everything!!! She was smiling and said okay mom you did good 😊. It's just a fun and addicting site. I give it 5 stars!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,Pleasantly surprised!!!

When I first ordered I was very  skeptical and didn’t expect much for the price I was even warned by a few people to not buy from Temu because it was all junk but I decided to take a chance anyway. I ordered a few little inexpensive things and figured “what the heck” if it’s junk I only lost a few bucks but much to my surprise the stuff was actually pretty good! I think only one item was defective, a small clock that was not working when I received it but Temu kindly gave me a refund on the clock. I’m beginning to purchase more items on Temu and I keep being pleasantly surprised at the quality of the items I order. Now I’m sure every now & then I’m going to order something that may not be of the best quality but so far so good. At the prices they sell things for I can’t really complain if an item turns out not to be of the best quality. So far I’m happy with the items I’ve purchased on Temu and I will keep buying from them.

1,2023-07-12 00:36:49,"When using the app, there’s too many pop ups for discounts. What really frustrated me to write this review is that Temu was offering 5 free items of your choice from a list of items as long as you sent referral codes. After going through a series of about 5 pop ups to get money off to obtain the “free” items, it states to invite a friend and get the final $3 off to obtain the “free” items. I sent the link to a friend right next to me, whom never used Temu before. They clicked the link, downloaded and created their account. They were then bombarded with several pop ups. On my end, the app stated that my referral link had been used. It said that I could check the use under “invitations” which didn’t provide any information or indicate my link was used, however, I was given $1.20 off for inviting my friend. Temu then asked me to invite another friend to get the remaining $1.80 which is confusing since it told me I would get $3. Temu is playing a game, and therefore, I do not recommend because they aren’t making it easy to just shop. I don’t want to jump through hoops to buy clothes. I did spend $200 on some items for my daughter, however it hasn’t arrived yet so I can’t speak on the quality. I can only review the app at this time.",Too many fake discounts…

Additionally, if they do ship your items, they are all poorly packaged and arrive severely damaged — even to the extent of not being able to use the item.

They are pretty good about giving you your money back when something arrives broken. I received one pair of pants that were good quality and another that were made out of the cheapest paper feeling fabric I’ve ever seen. If what you need is a piece of plastic that doesn’t do anything you could probably trust that item. Like Legos figures, they snap together and look like the real thing but definitely don’t buy anything you need to rely on. We bought a chicken coop door with an automatic open close feature with a timer. It only worked for a month and crapped out. We bought solar phone chargers that were supposed to mega capacity and it can’t charge a small desk fan for a few hours. I also heard on Reddit that Temu uses child labor to keep prices low and shipping fast so I’m not a fan of abusing children to make plastic crap cheaper. A dragon figurine I bought spears to have been painted by a child or a very sloppy adult. The “prizes” they give you are just a ploy to unload more plastic crap and make you buy more to get it.

Because you can find the same items through Shein with more discounts, and ship faster but the more important is their package come with safety. I shopped twice times on this app and both times the delivery was awful, and all products were mistreated and it always comes in a regular bag, not as they show in their advertisements in boxes, I think that they only do this with the influencers to be able to sell and that is the wrong attitude from Temu to customers since we are the consumers by paying them not them, even if the products are free for them I don't recommend this app unless you don’t care the safety your products. ¡La verdad es que Temu no es una buena aplicación! Porque puede encontrar los mismos artículos a través de Shein con más descuentos y enviar más rápido, pero lo más importante es que su paquete venga con seguridad. Compré dos veces en esta aplicación y las dos veces la entrega fue horrible, y todos los productos fueron maltratados y siempre viene en una bolsa normal, no como muestran sus anuncios en cajas, creo que eso solo lo hacen con los influencers para poder vender y esa es la actitud incorrecta de Temu hacia los clientes, ya que somos los consumidores al pagarles, no a ellos, incluso si los productos son gratuitos para ellos.

4,2023-01-28 16:24:06,I give this site 4 stars mostly it is a good site to find some good items at great deals. My issue is a couple things when things go on sale like really high like 50% to 90% off they inflate the price and put a slash through it and say it’s normally this price and it’s marked down from the inflated price x amount and these are the items you see regularly and know that they are like always 22$ but on this super sale they will be 90$ slashed thru and be 32$ for example and then they go back down when the period is over to they’re regular price second issue is the games u play where invites are the key to getting free stuff never will a spin or pick a hat or card etc… whatever the game is it will always get u the best prize the first two and then make u struggle for the last three dollars or whatever to get the prize I think we should be able to pay for more coins or somthing because they don’t let u spam invites and must do so to even get the prize all in all its an ok site if u know how to work it and or if u just want to buy stuff,Some things good Some things bad.

My daughter made me download it after she saw reviews on TikTok and her friends had made purchases. The products are for the most part better quality than you typically would get from a website like Wish or SHEIN…. At least what we have gotten so far. Also, the tracking and order processing updates are great. If there is a delay, they let you know and credit your account! I had one item that was broken when it arrived, but they were quick to refund my account in mere minutes. I honestly haven’t done a lot of the games or referrals for freebies— but I’m just satisfied with getting the products I am at good prices. There is something there for everyone— check it out, and read reviews. Also, if you do shopping on Etsy, I recommend checking on this site that the same product isn’t being sold on Temu for less than half the price it’s listed on Etsy.","My daughter made me do it, and I’m glad she did!"
1,2023-10-19 21:49:12,"I joined fetch a few months ago, thought it was super fun. It takes a long time to earn a rears- which is why we all download this app. But, I scanned daily all of my receipts and earned my first gift card. Used it and was estatic! Then, worked diligently to earn my next one. I earned it, went to use the e gift card at Tjmaxx , and when the cashier tried to scan it, it didn’t work. The cashier tried three times. I noticed when I left that the ap needed an update- so silly me thought that was the reason it didn’t work. Updated the app and went back to T.J.Maxx and it still didn’t work but this time it said it was redeemed. Things happen- I’m assuming because the app needed to be updated ( thought this because it said, some things may not work due to an upgrade needed) was very upset when I reached out to fetch that I first got a generic response that they couldn’t do anything. Wrote back several times and basically got told there is nothing they can do to help me. To say the least, I’m disappointed in the customer service. They should see my history and how I snapped re iota every single day. Great hobby- or so I thought until this happened. I am now moving on to other recipe apps like this.",Very disappointed in the customer service

Sometimes items come in the wrong way that doesn’t mean to take it out on the rest of the great stuff that comes out of this company. I would say the prices are great and a lot of everything works out just also sometimes the material is a little weird and it’s not something I always like but the company is great about returns and how they deal with it as well as refunds the refunds which I really appreciate the customer service is always very nice and pleasant,  The shirts are soft and they feel nice,here and there a little Problem with the sizing, sometimes too small as well as too big, but most of the time it is just right, and the company is always very good at taking care of the situation and you feel like they’re there to help but overall like I said before the company is good, it’s great when you have a budget.👍👍",Temu
3,2023-08-09 21:34:20,"So far, I’ve experimented with the experience of using the app and while the whole experience is based around users impulsively spending money and inviting more people to download the app, the app also offers a bunch of free stuff. The only catch is, you better be in it for the long game because there's plenty of opportunity for them to 'get you' and drain you of your time and energy in the meantime. It's very misleading and they continue to change the rules and how their games are played. For example, there's a mini game called Fishland and you have to feed a certain amount of fish to win free goods, except the fish gradually become harder to feed and take more food to feed them, It also get gradually harder to get fish food and takes longer and longer. It's a constant dangling of the carrot. It's meant to frustrate you and make you break down and just buy what they're offering.   I'll give a higher rating when the mini games and free offers feel less like a carnival game and make it worth my time.. probably would incentivize me to buy more by not feeling gyped all the time.","Pretty cool, but the free stuff isn’t all that free"

It’s using this information you give it such as your adeeess phone number and name, but have you noticed it asks for permission for your location and the ability to track your browsing across other sites, social media profiles, and ( you would never know) but it is stealing your texts conversations too. ALSO THEY HAVE YOUR CREDIT CARD!  “Ok, your conspiracy theorist” you might be saying, but just realize, this is made by the same company who created the app pinduoduo, which is a whole other can of worms, but basically you needed to reset your entire phone if you ever downladed it, because of the malware it enstilled once downloaded. yeah. Temu has not been proven to have stolen as much info orenstilled as much malware as pinduoduo (as of yet) but the other stuff Temu stole id proven. Who knows what else thé have stolen?

1,2023-07-04 12:14:34,Are the prices extremely low? Yes. Is the quality of the things your getting any good? Yes. Is it even real? Yes. BUT. The customer service and the third party carriers they use don’t make any of those things worth it. I have ordered from Temu multiple times and I’ve only received one of my orders. The package tracking is inaccurate. The communication between Temu and any carrier they use seems like next to none. I would check up on my packages. Track them. I would even call customer service for Temu and what ever shipping handler is supposedly delivering my order.  The first time I ordered from Temu I never even go my package. Even tho my address was correct in the app they still sent my package to the wrong address. They told me they’d fix it and I’d be receiving my package. 4 days later I get an email stating my package was already sent back to the sender. It was irritating and frustrating.  If I’m going to buy from your company have better communication with your carriers. At this point I’m deleting my account. It’s not worth it. After the 4th time that I’ve not received anything I’ve bought it doesn’t make the hard to believe prices worth it. Absolutely ridiculous. Do not buy from Temu.  Worst experience I’ve ever had.,DO NOT USE TEMU
3,2023-11-02 21:57:14,"Honestly, the app is great. I love how I can find stuff for pretty cheap here that anywhere else would be more expensive, so no problems with the quality of the products that they have. The only thing I’m not too just about is the courier service. Seriously the last few packages in a row have been delivered by CDL and they don’t even update on time when the package is out for delivery or when it has arrived. So the package will sit wherever it is placed for a while before it’s retrieved or stolen. The notification does not come at the time that they drop it off or whatever so if it’s not on secure area that is a window of time that it could’ve been stolen before the recipient even gets it. And I get that the company doesn’t choose which career service as courier services may depend on what service is available at that time. But never in a time that I’ve been ordering till now have I consistently gotten the same courier service each time. I just wish they would look for another service that may be available because honestly USPS, UPS, FedEx, or DHL is a lot more reliable than CDL is right",Great app but…

I really wanted the shoes though. Now my biggest issue is I haven’t received my refund for the of $54 dollars and some cents. I received a email or notification if you would like to say either one, 3 to 7 business days. It has been over 7 business days and have not received the refund back on my card at all.

Everything came in tact, within a week, and it gave me constant updates on where my packages were. It’s insanely cheap, so I was definitely skeptical, despite a bunch of my friends/family have confirmed it’s legit. It does have a $10 minimum for each order, with free shipping. I’ve seen some people complaining about that, but like let’s be real $10 is reasonable considering they’re giving you free shipping & crazy cheap stuff. They need to make money too! lol. The “free gift” stuff is kind of a give or take. I have quite a few friends who have actually gotten those 5 free gifts, but you need to have A LOT of friends (who don’t have temu) in order to get them and it takes a decent amount of time. they make it difficult on purpose which is annoying, but then again who would make it easy and give millions of people free things everyday?

My mom got a pair of shoes in the mail and told me she only paid $4.50 for them. So I said “From where?!“ And she said “This company called Temu“. I was EXTREMELY suspicious bc I had never heard of them but I had to try it out. I bought a pair of shoes for get this…$1.18!!!!! It was a new user discount (never got my new user gift cards though) And I was so surprised by the quality! I can’t wear them because they are half a size too small, but that was my own fault. They refunded me the money even though I wanted to exchange the shoes. Anyway, I have since become addicted. I am waiting on literally four different orders right now. And I’ve already had three more come in since I bought the shoes. The shipping is WAY FASTER than Wish.

4,2023-04-09 00:45:03,"Tbh,  I am extremely impressed with TEMU the first 3 months that I have been ordering from this site/app. Shipping is/was extremely fast (for items coming overseas) but lately, there has been majors delays on their shipment. Very unusual.  However, what I love from it is that it gives you automatically $5 credit if there is a delay from their 14 range for delivery.  Normally it takes a day or two longer.  Also, I like the constant offering of coupons for $12 less if you order $60 or more.  So far I had spent over $600 in a large amount of items.  I had invited friends and family alike because of the great prices.  I used it use Ali  x pre ss but it has taken forever to ship items to USA. Over a months to some of them. Also, I still have a problem with a seller that doesn’t want to honor a price on their site, I never going back to that place.  So far, TEMU has been a breath of good initiative and quick response….

However, right away you could tell the hand wraps were cheap made from low quality fabric. One of the wraps was damaged without even being used. They both went to the garbage. I figured because I paid for what I got - cheap unusable stuff. My second order included 4 items. The package came in a month later. I was at the point where I was ready to dispute the charge on my credit card. Just like the first order, everything looked horrible and went into the garbage. The app asked me for reviews. When I was trying to put a one star review, a message popped out asking me to contact the customer service. I contacted the customer service through the chat and told the person what happened to the items received. Without any hesitation, the customer service representative offered me a full refund and I received the refund instantly on my PayPal account which was only positive experience I had with TEMU.

1,2023-04-26 14:33:29,"I was doing the ‘Hat-Trick Draw’ game to win a number of items, but they make it incredibly hard to actually win. After getting all the free energy points, I needed about 16 energy left within 24 hours, and the only way to get more energy was to invite friends. Here’s where the scam takes place. They report you can have up to 3 existing accounts  accept your invite for 1-3 energy a piece, or have new users register using your generated game link for an unlimited amount of times which would give you 1-5 energy a piece. Issue is that when your needed energy goes below 12, it doesn’t give you 1-3 or 1-5, it gives 1. One. A single energy. So after 24 hours of soliciting my friends and family to download an app that’s promising me a free item bundle, I make it down to only 1 energy needed (meaning I have more or less needlessly got 10-15 of my contacts to click a sketchy link just to help me) when the hard stop timer resets and kills my game. Because Temu lied about how much energy they would ACTUALLY give you per successful invite, I wasted 24 hours of time and annoyed relatives and made them think they were risking their internet security to get literally nothing out of it.

When I inquired with customer service why this would happen, I got zero real response. My chat experience started at 2:06 pm. I finally received communication from Darwin, offering to help at 2:35 pm. Whatever, it's days before Christmas, and they had a convenient queue countdown letting me know I started at 252 in the waiting line. I wasn't particularly in a hurry, so I waited it out. I asked Darwin why my order was refunded, and I got the same stock answer twice: ""In order to protect the safety of your funds..."" Listen, Darwin, I heard you the first time, and you still haven't actually told me why my order was refunded. PayPal was happy to pay it, as was American Express. So anyway, Darwin was no help. He told me he had informed a supervisor and ghosted me. The customer service did not get better from there.

Don’t do it guys. Less you got like a whole family who are going to the “new Temu users who have NEVER downloaded the app before”. Cuz the existing user is limited to 4. So basically, you had to start inviting new users at one point to cut the price. But by that time, each person you invite will cut less and less. In my case, I have 60 cents left after my 4 existing users. So I thought one new user would be enough to go to zero. But when I got that new user, it only cut the price by 20 cents. And the next one, would cut by 10, and less and less. Basically, as I said, less you got a whole family or friends who are going to be new users, you ain’t gon get it y’all.

It’s takes like months if it gets delayed it will take even longer it took my stuff like 3 months I literally i almost forgot I ordered it the thing I wish they would get rid of the 10$ you have to spend it’s honestly annoying and they would have more games cause most of the time the people I share with already played the games or people could make games of their owns for people to play and the delivery doesn’t take forever 😑,Package wasting issue and lack of games to play and delive takes forever

1,2023-05-03 00:13:45,"Go to the Better Business Bureau if you want to see true reviews of Temu. Customer support is basically nonexistent for Temu, and they don't assist customers at all. Temu needs to use trustworthy shipping companies that don't lose huge orders. All of the hours out of days that I spent to find the items that I needed and then order them are down the drain! The order was lost and now Temu expects me to go back through and find the items all over again because the order link does not separate the lost items from the delivered items. It shows that it does, but whenever I click on the shipped but not delivered link, it only takes me back to the entire order altogether. It's far too inconvenient and too time-consuming to do this all over again. Also, on the Wish app, I can save over 1500 items within my wish list. It's the same for the wish list in the Shein app. Temu needs to allow much more to be saved on their wish list because this would make re-ordering items that Temu lost so much easier and much quicker.

However, there are “games” where they say “earn $$$” or “earn $$$ credit”, but it’s pretty impossible to do. And when you try to back out they give a pop up that says “this person earned $$$$” and put up an impossible amount of money!!! I tried a cookie jar game, where it says “invite new players to drop cookies faster.” I did this, it says “100 cookies = $1”… but guess what!!! After you hit the redeem button you then have to spin to earn the money! 1000 cookies equals 1 spin.. and the closer you get, the less you get.. first couple spins was 20 vouchers of 100, but once i got to 93 vouchers of 100, suddenly i was only getting pennys.

The app itself is designed like a microtransaction pay to play game, with all of these little gimmicks trying to get you to “win money” or “get free items” but they are all designed to make you spend even more money. There’s one where they promise a free item and let you choose it. But then you have to earn it by grinding on this app day after day, sending links to friends, pretending to feed these fish, and the closer you get to your goal the harder it makes it, where every drop in the bucket “feeding the fish” contributes less and less. It’s all a cheap scam. By the last day you’re able to do the event, each feeding contributes to 0.01% of the total for the one fish. It’s manipulative and a waste of time. If you want to buy the stuff, just use the website. The app also has built in ad trackers so they’re tracking your views and purchases and selling that information, just like Facebook and others do.

I did not realize this when I decided to try temu, I wish I had known.  And you get what you pay for…of the 25 items I ordered, 11 were so bad I returned them or threw them away. Some were totally defective (like a meat tenderizer that the silver finish rubbed off and turned my hands black when i tried to wash it with regular dish soap), some were  not as pictured/described (weird gathering stitches on a blouse, ‘stretchy’ shoelaces that weren’t actually stretchy at all, shorts where the fabric in person is shiny and stiff instead of matte and drapey the way it looked in the photos), some seem possibly dangerous (a dog cooling mat that was cool but must have some weird chemicals on it b/c my dog who loves to lay on EVERYTHING refuses to go near it).  So basically it seems too good to be true and it definitely is. The one good thing is returns were easy and customer support was helpful when I had to contact them.

The limit for being able to check out is also frustrating because it goes up everytime we/i buy something. It’s hard to go up to that limit when we don’t know what to buy. There could be a feature where on the weekend we could have no limit on purchasing items without having to worry about the spending limit. The games are sometimes rigged and it’s hard to get new users. I wish there was a bigger limit for existing users. If the games are luck based I think it will be better because there’s more chances than actually getting new users. I understand that new users are important because new users equals more people using the app and buying stuff.

The shipping is fast for what is probably coming from over seas. maybe a week or little more. They will text you a lot of times with updates on your order so you are never left in the dark wondering where your package is. I love getting a deal so Temu is my kind of place to shop. I recommend looking around on the site for the best deal because many times they will have it chеaper from a different seller I suppose because there are multiples of similar items.

I like to wait til they send me a coupon to place an order. Try it you will like it. Warning most the time when they offer free gifts you are going to have to get friends to sign up and you will play games to get the points then you will need more points to win and you will need friends to sign up to actually win the prizes you have!!",Great prices and so many items to choose!
5,2023-10-16 03:14:44,"So i've been using temu for a little while now,and I can say it's pretty good really. It's really cheap,kind of like shein but a little better i guess? The gifts are legit,too. I got 15 dollars from playing on paypal but trust me it may take a while and you need a bunch of people unless you have a lot of friends. But overall,it's a good app. But you still have to be careful with some of the things in this Temu app because some people also get scammed or robbed. I'm not saying it's a bad app and you shouldn't get it because it's pretty good for a online shopping app tbh. I like the app but i think it should improve the little ""free gifts credit"" thingys because it is a little bit rigged. Yes,it may be a peramid scheme but i've never seen any better and almost every online shop does that right? But yeah,it's good! But please also be aware that the games are rigged like I said. Some of the games (or all tbh) have this trick that if you shared and got all the cutting prices then when you share and invite other people not only they lower the prices for you to have less time,but they give you only 1-3 days to finish. Now i'm not saying it's not that much or anything but still,it may take a while to do this because not that much people have a lot of friends like other people do. So they should really fix that and they are lucky I gave them 5 stars. (which i guess?? they deserve idrk). Have a great day!! Have a great day!!!!",Marvelous place to find almost anything your heart desires!

I finally took a chance on some clothing and for the most part the items were like the photos, but there have been a couple of items that came in that have made me scared to buy clothing from them again without reading lots of reviews first. This new thing online of advertising a clothing item prototype then shipping something way different is really irritating. For instance in fashion how the fabric falls, the drape,a proper cut, fabric texture, and of course blending colors in the pattern are key to a beautiful item. A dress made out of cotton or a cotton blend will flow and drape more more flattering than a poly blend. So if the model is wearing a flowing caftan dress, generously cut but also more fitted in the bust (more complimentary), in a textured cottony fabric, in a vibrant color coordinated pattern, you know how that might look on you. But when you receive a similar item of thin shiny cheap material, cut very narrow not flowing, shorter in length and shorter sleeves, with a printed on pattern that has odd color combinations, you feel cheated. So far I have received 3 such items from Temu but I’ve also received 4 that were exactly as they were portrayed.

The quality of merchandise can vary a lot but I have been very impressed by a few items, like a cotton canvas purse that is thick, durable, washable, and looks great. My favorite items so far has been the neat little bucket washing machine that gets my socks and underwear cleaner than a regular washing machine and rechargeable motion sensor lights that detect day/night (that's a lot of cutting edge tech for $7.50!) These little inexpensive items improve your quality of life, like a drain hair catcher that saves me money on plumbers, a nice quality purse to replace an old one, car blind spot mirrors that can save my life, sanding discs fo repairing paint scratches on my car, dishwashing steel wool, adhesive hooks for jackets, clips that hold my shower curtain in place so it doesn't stick me uncomfortably, and several amazing Apple watch band knockoffs that look like the real thing and cost less than $10!

5,2023-11-10 09:38:08,"There is finally a company that understands the economical struggles, and aspects of where we live for the majority of the populace , being poor to middle class. Temu offers wonderful and bountiful products. you need temu has it. You want it you’ll be hard-pressed that Temu doesn’t have it and so much more!and Temo does not have to have statement of we understand that is hard to get by in  today’s economy to get what you need let alone be able to get a little something that you want. All you have to do is look at the price and know that Temu gets us and expresses that understanding without saying a word, because they know it’s the dollar we’re looking for and the amount is price that reflects their understanding of the economy who the populace is that keeps it running. It is the working classes. Temu  struggles that come with the working class understands how economically hard it is for the working class.  Temu allows us the working class the strugglers to get the things we want and need for ourselves our children, and family family at very very affordable prices, and with those prices we can order almost like in bulk, but we need, if not most of it unlike other stores and online shopping at website store keep up the awesome work good quality products and you’ll have a repeat shopper until I cannot shop anymore",Love Temu because this company understands the working class.
5,2023-05-10 14:38:20,"Temu is very entertaining.  I drop in for a quick visit and end up staying.  Like most bargain shopping sites you have to pick carefully on items you are seriously wanting to use and go hog wild on the cheap fun stuff.  Be cause most items are relatively inexpensive it’s a great place for trying out stuff to see if it really works.  No biggy if it doesn’t and hurry and buy a bunch if it does.  What I do is go through and click buy on stuff I think I can’t live without then I go through and rethink and delete or keep.  Since I can’t order huge amounts of stuff I go through and pick some of what I want the most and order.  Then hopefully   I can order some more when I can afford it.  A lot of the items sell out pretty fast so you have to decide while they are available.  No pressure! Ha ha.  When I look at all the reviewers of Temu  on all the different sights and what they say I’m pretty impressed.  Just remember it’s still someone’s personal opinion, but it does give you an idea of what an item looks like on real people and how an item is used and what you probably shouldn’t buy. Ihave many things from Temu that I am happy with, many on a regular basis.  Just remember the choice is yours.  Today I am wearing a Temu dress, headband, bracelet, and steriling ring all purchase at low prices.  About $20 for it all, not bad. Have a great day!",So much to see……so little time
5,2023-07-27 22:15:04,"I learned about TEMU by accident recently, and first ordered a small fan to cool my laptop computer. It was very inexpensive and was sent postage paid. Next, I ordered an electronic kit to build an signal generator, which was also inexpensive and works as I expected it to do. Most recently I ordered an ac motor speed controller to slow down my Dremel tool. It came fully assembled, and works as described, Again it was sent postage paid. I also, on another order bought some electronic components, and last was a small boresight camera that I plan to use when cleaning my chimney. So far, every  purchase was postage paid, was in excellent condition as received, and all were at bargain prices. Only one arrived late, but it was only one day late, and I was given a $5 credit for that. The only complaints I have deal with information about the products on the internet, on their app, and included with the products. Often there is not a word of any kind to tell how to use it, though the camera did come with a foldout ""manual"" that gave what was needed to use it. And that required a magnifier for my old eyes to read it. Overall, that is minor, but I think TEMU will have more sales if it gives better descriptions on its website and included with the product when it is purchased.",TEMU is an excellent source of low cost items of quality.
3,2023-09-04 18:44:11,"Ok so I started using Temu and have gotten quite few items. Quality is ok some are cheap, some are actually good. The deals are just ok. They offer coupons and discounts but I notice they also raise the price when you are using a coupon (I notice everything)  As for the stupid games that gives you “free stuff” farmland, fish land and the others are purely a fake. Towards getting close to finally getting your gifts, they raise to even .01 % for every feed. Meaning you need more food or water to complete 100%. I added users and also made a purchase to get 600K in fish food and those 600k didn’t even get one fish to 100% so I think they only do it to keep people buying more and inviting users but to get to finally get the “free gift” will come harder and harder. I read the rules and they can even come to 0.01 cents contribution! I’ve been in .07 cents away from my gift for a month and finally now it’s only .05 cents. Wow I won’t spent months trying for this. So TEMU please change that and if you offer a free gift then do it, don’t fool people around by having to feed fishes or water for the rest of your life to get a gift in about 50 years from now.  Aside from that, returns have been ok, no hassle that way, delivery is also good and ok timing. They provide with tracking info and it’s helpful. I would pay close attention to the prices and when they offer you a “discount”  Don’t fall for the games, it’s a waste of time","Products and deals ok, Games are not ok"
4,2023-05-11 06:34:26,"I’ve been pleasantly surprised with my shopping experience at Temu and only have a couple of suggestions.   I have purchased a number of clothing items through the app and have found discrepancies between the material description listed for a few items versus the actual material found on the tag once I received the items.  When I made Temu aware of my disappointment,  I have to acknowledge they were more than happy to provide me with a full refund, very promptly.  Hopefully they will be more attentive to making this information accurate.  Secondly, when trying to find a pair of cargo shorts by waist size, many times the size shown (S30 for example) is not really a 30 inch waist.  When you tap on the S30, the app brings up additional sizing information and I have seen waist sizes ranging between 28 and 32 as the actual waist measurement for the S30 size option.     I do realize that international sizing can be rather inconsistent and that Temu may not be able to do anything about this issue.  I would just have to suggest that you be careful to determine your correct size when ordering clothing.  Lastly, and this is just a personal preference for myself, I wish that Temu had more boys/mens cargo shorts available in a smaller waist size (28-29 inches) that also have a button closure.

I have been stuck on this last .02 cents I PROMISE I’ve been playing it daily since around September, definitely October 🎯 yet I get this close then y’all put a time restriction on it after I played the game for months, daily. How can u allow us to Win all 4 prizes in less than 4 minutes but takes MONTHS to •feed the fish• then it expires 👎👎👎 the frustration, aggravating to work on it for months to have it swept out in front of u😂😂😂😂😂😂😂insanity!!!!!! Cause after all that , I still love to shop. Just would be nice to actually receive the FREE items . Y’all think I’m lying, check it out when the tell u pick 5 items , then share,,, EVERY-TIME they tell u to spin always hit the X button on top right. U DONT have to share , hit the X instead of sharing, IT STILL GIVES you the coins, pearls… u can take the total all the way down to 1.00 then ur stuck.. don’t believe me, try it !!!

5,2023-09-29 20:41:36,"I have ordered my lines from other online company’s for my catfish and bass rod and reels that I refurbish and resell, but this was my first time using Temu. The ads were very informative and the pics shown are exactly what the lines they sent look like, what was the icing on the cake was no shipping costs involved. So I ordered 2 reels of line, 1 orange for my catfish reels and gray for my bass reels. Spooling them on today and excited about first fishing trip using them. So far Very pleased with the ordering, shipping & the emails with updates as to delivery dates and other deals with the same types of line I had ordered. I will be ordering from Temu again seeing that I refurbish reels and always offer them with new braid already installed. Great results so far from Temu, looking forward to buying from them again Dan Update on this review I spooled the orange 20 pound braid on one of my catfish reels, tried it out to see if handled and casted good. Results did not catch a catfish but did catch and reel in to the dock so I could release it was a 20 pound plus soft shell turtle, this one had a neck as thick as my left fore arm, and the line did outstanding results. What Temu says in the description about this braid was spot on. In fact so pleased with it I ordered 4 more colors of this braid, this will be on all the reels I refurbish and resell.",First order
5,2022-11-25 22:26:08,"So I did not have high expectations for this app. However, the items that I have purchased have been really well made and good quality. I have purchased so far, a bread shaped eyeshadow palette, a beanie, creature bookmark, hair clip. They were all awesome.  Before purchasing I made sure to read reviews and would not buy the item without seeing pictures that people have uploaded during their review. I think that really helped me to get good quality products. I have made another larger purchase since then. Just waiting to receive it. The  first order arrived in less than two weeks, so my second order should arrive in a week or so. That being said, there are some items I don’t know if I would purchase just because I don’t have the extra money to spend  to have it not work or be the quality I wanted to, so I definitely think it’s a great day. I will continue buying from the app. Black Friday Shipping currently is free which I absolutely love. I’m super stoked for my next order to arrive..  some people have compare this to “Wish” which maybe there are items that would be comparable. For me, so far with what I have received, I definitely think that Temu is much better and shipping is quick in comparison.",Exceeds expectations so far!
4,2023-10-06 04:54:15,"Don’t get me wrong I LOVE Temu and I have placed SEVERAL orders(atleast once a week) BUT I have been playing the fishland and farmland games for literally MONTHS now and on fishland I have been down to $0.01 for almost a month to get my free stuff and while they give you certain amounts of fish food per day when you first start playing the food feeds the fish FAST but when you start getting to where you are about to earn your free stuff the amount of time you have to spend playing, or money buying stuff just to get free food you may as well just buy the stuff you are trying to get for free! And we all know that it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to share with a “new user” bc of the fact that the app is already out there and popular! So to me it isn’t really fair to make us spend a ton of money to get items for free when the prices are so cheap we may as well just buy the stuff! Plus they only give you free fish food certain times of day and if you don’t catch it then you won’t get it and seeing as how we are adults and have jobs it is also nearly impossible to get the free food! Then the fact that they don’t send you the “match” challenge until you are already almost out of food! Challenges should be easier and cheaper seeing as how I’m sure this app already makes PLENTY of money off of their products!",Ask too much to earn free stuff
3,2023-06-28 10:39:25,"Don’t fall for there free items. , fake advertisement! Temu will require you to send out a bunch of invites and it gives you points towards your free items but it makes you pick 5 or 10 items and you can only win them by getting enough points or money cut off for all of them. When I got to the end 8 points away I had to invite one more person every time I invited someone the points needed stayed the same. I contact customer service they said the people you invite need to down load the app and participate in a free event. If they don’t use your link or already customers then it won’t count. Even though every time I sent a link and shared it I got points / money towards the free items until it was almost filled I mean like 95% done. So beware of that or will waste your time and effort for nothing . It’s a false advertisement loop hole at its best.! When it says spin this to claim a reward then says you have won 5 free items pick it , after you pick the you have to pay with sharing your invite link and make sure they sign up and probably then they still won’t give you it it will come up with another stipulation like you need spend this amount in store to receive free items then charge shipping by telling you you need to invite 5 more people and not let you pay shipping your self, so you tell me is that a scam? …",If something seems to good to be true it usually is. There’s no free items
4,2023-09-17 17:44:16,"I would like to start off by saying that I like Temu. Prices change on a regular basis. You can get your money back if something goes on sale once you have purchased it. I have won free gifts for playing games but once you win the chances of winning again get higher. They always want you to invite when we only know so many people. They should give you more credit for being a regular customer and repeat purchaser. Not to mention the number of times you have shared. The coupons run out to fast and some are for amounts that most people wouldn’t even spend at one time. Therefore they become no use. If you are like me I was skeptical about ordering for the 1st time and wouldn’t place an order for a long time and once I did I placed a very small order (under $20) to be on the safe side. That’s over 2 hours of work I was willing to take a chance on. Some of the items are good quality with good prices and others are very cheap quality and not worth it. I believe they need better descriptions actual photos without edits to be posted and a photo when item is in edit form or fluffed etc to show its potential giving insight on how many was used to get the same effect. I prefer cotton clothing and it’s very difficult for me to find. Need photos of front , back and both sides.",How I feel about the app
4,2023-02-09 01:54:16,"It is better than Wish, quality-wise, though some of the items are the same. It feels like AliExpress but you get your order in less than 10 days (my first one came in 7) as opposed to 1-2 months. I AM glad I gave it a try and hope I don’t blow all my expendable income on it because, while there are a few things I need, most of it is just stuff I want. They do honor the initial 90% off gift and if you have time to play their popularity/annoy your friends game, you can get some great deals. The coupons don’t last long enough at all. The other day I had a $16 off $40 coupon but it expired in 24 hours when I was still building my next cart, so I find myself waiting to make the purchase until I receive a good coupon. I have tried the referral thing to win free items and credits but I’m lame and antisocial so I don’t know enough people and I also don’t have the time to peruse reddit for hours looking for strangers to “click for click” with. It makes me a little frustrated (and obviously just jealous) when I see people who have received 100+ free gifts they’re going to resell just because they are kids with no jobs and spend their days being “influencers” on tik tok-In that regard it feels like a tween’s app, but again, I’m just lame so you may have better luck with the whole “Team Up Price Down” thing.",Legit & Addictive
4,2023-10-02 15:59:15,"Had some issues with an order- I was sent someone else’s order. There was no problem getting my order refunded and they let me keep the other that was sent to me so I didn’t have to hassle with a return at all. But the refund was issued as a TEMU credit. I would have preferred they just sent me my original order or sent the money back to my debit card. The only other issue I’ve had is with a third party shipper that they used- Lazer Ship, that company is trash. Had so many issues getting my package and their customer service is literally non existent. There’s a button you click to reach someone on their website, which is a total lie. Your message goes nowhere, nobody reads it. I understand that isn’t TEMU or their company, just warning anyone that has to use them for their packages. They are awful. Again, I am overall satisfied with my shopping experience. Do not be scammed by the games- farmland and fish land seem like fun ways to win or earn free products or coupons but the closer you get to the goal, the harder they get to reach. Very time consuming and all the “free gift” boxes they tell are exclusive to you, are not. The prices never change. It’s just consumer manipulation and again, just a waste of time. Stuff is still super cheap and you get what’s advertised. Still worth using",Overall satisfied
3,2023-09-18 14:29:32,"I absolutely love temu. Their prices are out of this world affordable, and their products are actually good quality unlike some other online shop pining websites. But what I don’t understand is how they make it a 10$ minimum for orders because they want to conserve how much plastic they use, but at the same time they cover they entire thing with tape! I also don’t understand that if you have credit and you have enough to get a free item why you can’t just get that item that is under 10$ and not have to add something else? It would be amazing if you guys could change that policy or at least make it that once a week you don’t have to do a 10$ minimum and that there is no minimum. Other than those two things it’s a great app and I definitely recommend if your looking for some cheap home decor or cute jewelry and clothes!   Edit:  The games that are suggesting it’s easy to win a couple free items as well are totally not worth it. I don’t recommend wasting your time on a game trying to get a free item when it is literally impossible to win them. Temu does not give you even a close amount enough of food to be able to feed your fish or water your grass to win the items so instead of trying to get a free Nintendo switch or cargo pants just buy it or wait until you ACTUALLY notice the price went down.",Don’t understand the 10$ minimum
5,2023-09-20 03:57:29,I love this app so much. I cannot believe that all these sellers are on here and sellers such great products at great prices too. I know some cannot use the app but for those who can it is even easier in the app and you can do so much on here. It’s not some store app that is boring it is exciting and they seem to update it all the time. This is my first year shopping with Temu and I am just wondering who thought up this wonderful app and what took so long???  I think everyone needed a store they could shop with and get amazing offers for some really amazing items. I had a issue with a couple of my orders and I must say it was even easier in here then it would have been on the phone. Also I ended up getting connected to a woman banned carrie and she helped me tremendously. They made good for the trouble I went through and in the end everything worked out. All these sellers on here selling direct I love it. I also especially love the games I as of late have according to my husband become addicted to winning lol. I just have to spend a very small amount of time winning items and well I’ve gotten so many people in My family And friends circle on this app. They love it just as much.

1,2023-09-02 03:11:08,They probably won’t let me put screen shots but if you come by a lady names Gail on customer service and even send screen shots supporting your issue she will completely go around the actual problem. I’ve had two issues with being shorted on the side games where you can get (FREE) stuff supposedly. Funny how I get a price adjustment and my side game completely freezes saying I got refund on my orders which I didn’t. That lady never fixed my issue just tried giving me a coupon to shut me up. Then I finally unfreeze my account my self placing an order to replace the 200g they took back for my order and I’m now not getting my whole grams like I should. Funny because I’m super close to getting my free items. so I ended up with Gail in customer service lady with my current issue and she’s completely going around my issue even though my screen shots clearly show that it says ten grams and then shows I only received 1 gram she starts babbling about how I can get grams of water. Like no lady the game is not giving me my full grams. Then try’s to tell me that you can’t harvest plants on fish land and I screen shot her that you indeed can. Needless to say she said I wasn’t responding to her after I gave a rating of 1 on the chat because she was no help and she ended the conversation. Temu was great up until it wasn’t. Deleting app after my last orders come in. If what I’m paying is funding her job I’ll gladly stop funding it.,Had an issue and it wasn’t resolved 2 times in one day.

A pain with extra clicks just to find anything. A cppl days ago it was suddenly back to how it used to be which was awesome! Now it's back to the 🤬 way. Just put it back & leave it alone!! I look at reviews for everything & used to make reviews but no more bc if you do a review from then on it adds another step to click on to see price adjustments etc. Stop ""fixing"" something that's NOT broke!!  #3 - When it takes near 1000g & over 3wks to get a fish from 70% to 100% y'all are getting beyond ridiculous! My 1st rnds of Farmland & Fishland when placing an order that was, say, $32 I purposely added $8 to make it a $40 order to get 800g. Now that I've realized once you get down to 2 fish / 2 wheats 800g is nothing I'll save my $8! ** For anyone that hasn't played the stupid games just know when you FINALLY win you have like 48hrs to place a $100 order to be able to use the $40 off coupon you spent gawd knows how long winning. Btw, you have the same 48hrs to place another $100 order to use $30 off coupon.

My favorite items so far has been the neat little bucket washing machine that gets my socks and underwear cleaner than a regular washing machine and rechargeable motion sensor lights that detect day/night (that's a lot of cutting edge tech for $7.50!)  These little inexpensive items improve your quality of life, like a drain hair catcher that saves me money on plumbers, a nice quality purse to replace an old one, car blind spot mirrors that can save my life, sanding discs fo repairing paint scratches on my car, dishwashing steel wool, adhesive hooks for jackets, clips that hold my shower curtain in place so it doesn't stick me uncomfortably, and several amazing Apple watch band knockoffs that look like the real thing and cost less than $10! It's being able to buy all these items that life starts to feel a little more affordable. Thank you Temu for helping people's paychecks stretch a little further!",Love this app!
1,2023-05-05 14:29:47,"I have been using this app for a while, however I have had many issues with the quality of these clothes. I bought a pair of sweatpants and as they arrived they looked nothing like the pictures. They had a strange seam line going down them, which wasn’t on the picture. Oh well, I’ll just contact them. I was given a refund, no problem, however I was still a little upset with the situation as it left a bad taste in my mouth. So, I go ahead and make another purchase, buying two pairs of pants and a shirt. The shirt was poor quality, but it was pretty cheap, so I was not too mad. But the pants were the problem. I received a pair of jeans that were blue and looked NOTHING like the picture.  And as I opened the package, I discovered they were WET. They were in the package in a secure plastic bag, so I have no idea how they were wet. I can’t imagine it was a shipping issue, because nothing else was wet. And the other pair of pants I received looked nothing like the imagine. Angry with what I received, I contact Temu about the two pairs of pants. And they told me there was nothing I could do without a refund. Here’s the thing - I don’t think I should be forced to use my gas money (I do not live near a postal box) to return my LOW QUALITY items that are NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE of them while they’re wet!!! This is a horrible business. I’ve recommended so many people to this app, but these Temu does not care. I am BEYOND angry with this experience and in disbelief.",HORRIBLE experience
1,2023-06-24 21:58:32,"They advertise profusely using prices that are a fraction of the real price, sometimes with a notation only for new customers (but usually not). But even new customers don’t get that price as they will say the item doesn’t qualify even though you clicked thru the ad to get to the exact item they advertised. If you don’t buy the ridiculously overpriced junk they were hawking, they will keep showing you new item prices for other items at a fraction of their true cost, but then say you are ineligible to receive the discount because your not a new customer. They will continue to show these prices on every item and won’t honor the price. The real price is typically about 10x that price, for inferior quality goods with slow shipping and using mail fraud in order exploit a niche in postal rates. This makes the goods effectively non-returnable. Product pictures are frequently altered and aren’t the real product. They also sell your info to anyone and everyone and won’t delete your account even though you’ve instructed them to, opening you up being hacked. Months later and I am still being sent verification codes for an account that I asked to be deleted and all info purged.  Whatever you do, don’t give these people your credit card info, you will regret it. Scam City. Apple really needs to remove this from the App Store.

The prices are great and the quality is decent and if you can sweat through the shipping time, there are some steals here! And, the classic saying “you get what you pay for” applies here, as it does everywhere. Be smart. If you want high quality clothes, don’t buy them here. If you want beginner art supplies to try stuff out, or stamps, or trinkets or tools or hair stuff - and can wait 10-14 days - give it a whirl. Think online dollar store quality stuff. Know what you’re getting yourself into. Just made my first larger priced purchase, so I’m interested to see how if the quality increases as the prices increase.   I’ve been surprised at how well things arrive given the distance and wrapping - which is basically just a heavy plastic bag - but even glass things have come intact so far. And they’ve arrived within the guaranteed delivery window every time. I’m also a fan of the price adjustment option, which gives you store credit if prices go down within a window after purchase. Overall, I’m pretty pleased and am way too tempted by these deals.",It felt like a gamble but I’m pleasantly surprised. Just be careful.

However, Temu is outrageously cheap about the “games”,”coupons/discounts”, and “rewards” they promote. You can spend all the time you want playing along but you will never actually get to a collection that meets the reward requirements. You can share and send out links but all the sudden you’re not advancing the same. You start getting only fractions of what you did before. Which is okay considering maybe days from now I’ll get the 0.35 cents I need left and then I can unlock the whole set up. GUESS WHAT THEY RESTART THE GAME PROGRESS and there’s no way to avoid it. Almost like they don’t want you to actually win anything?🤔 which is why they compensate all the data mining you sign up for with actual products….oh wait they still get all my info and I get absolutely nothing. Hmmmm sounds like a bargain cause you don’t get any of that time you spent checking in for “water”,”fish food”, or “stars”. Which brings me to this other point I need users to understand REGARDLESS of how many pop ups you get about a double reward or discount or whatever you’re not actually gaining anything from this.

Sure you can get individual items here for cheaper, but you now have to spend minimum $20 to be able to check out!! You can't see a small item you like and get it for a couple dollars, you're forced to spend $20 every. Single. Time. You want something. Which means you're forced to buy a bunch of stuff you don't actually want, or you have to wait forever until you have $20 worth of stuff you want. So it'll be months before you get your stuff... Recently they've also stopped accepting returns from me. They make me send the item back, where they used to let me keep the product and give me my money back in the form of credit. I understand why they'd want the items back, but that's just going to turn me away. Items here are extremely hit or miss. 50% of what you buy is nothing at all like the item description. I'm not going to the post office every time I need a return. That's so annoying. Plus it costs me money to get the box and packing materials, probably more money than the product itself! Either give consistent quality and trustworthy items or let me return it without a headache. Deleting after my current order ships to me, and never coming back!

I’ve noticed a pattern in the automated-sounding reviews, because they are all titled the same thing. Despite them being different, they all sound like they are sent from one singular person because the writing style is the same. All the reviews are structured very alike, and the usernames are fake. I hope you actually soak in this review instead of replying with some automated response. I hope you realize this is a serious matter, because it is illegal to give yourself reviews. The FTC comes after businesses that do this, and if you don’t quit it now, I’ll make sure they hear of it. I’m not trying to be rude or shut down your business, this is for your own good.  Hi Temu! I’ve come back to check on your reviews, and it seems you’ve taken my advice. I haven’t seen one fake review anymore. Thank you. I just need to mention- the app is good enough so you don’t have to fake reviews. The company is already TT famous. To everyone who reads this- get the app. No substantial money can be lost on cheap items because not much was paid anyways. Another thank you, Temu.

Since babies grow so fast, I can’t justify spending a lot of money on their clothes.  But getting like to all the pro’s about Temu, their prices are affordable, the order’s always comes before the delivery date they give me and returns are easy and are never questioned. Occasionally, if something is damaged, they will ask for pictures which makes total sense to me. Yes, some of their things are cheaply made but I’ve never had a problem with those things because, for me, they were silly signs I was hanging outside anyway and no sign outside last forever unless you paid big bucks for it and sometimes they don’t last either.  My only con would be the packaging is not the best and you most likely won’t be able to return an item in it. I always save my smaller boxes for situations like this. Temu will email you a mailing label and returns are always free.  So thank you Temu for being such a great company for me. I really appreciate the affordable prices, quick deliveries and easy free returns even when it’s my fault. ❤️",Great item at a bargain

I have had absolute success on receiving all my orders, in good condition, now I normally wouldn’t buy out of the country because of my experiences before, like taking 2 to 4 months to receive something. However a couple of weeks isn’t bad at all , that I can do! Almost everything has been great , I’ve decided that the woman’s clothes with a few exceptions just don’t work for me. I enjoy the daily gift box with credit, I don’t like being rushed to hurry and close my purchases in fear of my items running out , it causes me to make mistakes on my orders, like doubling and tripling the same items.

It’s a good app, you do get your stuff for a cheap price but you have to have at-least $5 worth of items to do so. The most irritating thing about Temu is the “free gifts.” It’s constantly trying to give me free stuff, and it always gives me the best reward EVEN when I press the X to leave. It always gives you the best gift but practically makes it impossible to get it. It also lied to me and said I would get 30 points for inviting a knew person, and I only got 10! They also constantly notify you of “deals” that arnt real, even after I turned notifications off for this app. Along with farmland, they made it really easy to get wheat in the beginning but once the end started to come it got really hard. It went from giving me around 30% of the wheat grown with one water to only giving me .11% for each drop of water! It’s making me really upset because I had 195 water to use on my plant and it’s the LAST ONE.

5,2022-11-27 22:37:37,"What this company is doing is illegal.  If you don’t believe me, go through the reviews.  First, they make it extremely difficult to see an items reviews.  How?  Click on the reviews and what you will see are reviews for a whole bunch of items, not just the item your looking at.  Second, start reading the reviews.  Countless reviews are clearly negative, yet it shows that the person gave the item 5 stars which is impossible.  Simply put, this is fraud and needs reported to Apple so their app is removed from the store.  After reading the reviews, it is very clear that their “review” grading system is a lie as well.  Further, when you double check that the things I am writing are true (and they are), report it to your attorney general.  Listen, I’ve ordered off Temu quite a few items and have been happy with most of them (not all—some clothing items have a strange fit).  Even so, a companies business practices must be on the up and up and if not, they should be forced out of business.  Transparencies led to Amazon’s success.

This app is not a fake, it’s probably hard to believe it but it’s really not. I ordered some stuff for myself as a Christmas present and it came in amazing condition and  nothing was broken. Everything was as it seemed on the app. You can share this app with some of your friends and get points that you can use for coupons to get money to taken off of your order, which always helps because I LOVE saving money. this app is an amazing way to do that. I seriously recommend it. you can do giveaways, which can give you free items that you don’t even have to pay for, and it helps me and my family. not only that, whenever I got my package  it came at the right time. It told me it was going to come on dec 15 and it said that if it was late will give me a five dollar credit off my next order. My package also came with a little surprise, with it also coming quick.

They’ll have you thinking it’s attainable and it just isn’t. Here’s an example: I just started Farmland today. While a large chunk of the price of items is gone, everything else about it is a scam. Stating “up to $2 per wheat” (you won’t understand that until you’re in it and see it for yourself). Not once have I received $2 per wheat. Same with Fishland. As you go through it the value reduces significantly. They’re only removing .05 CENTS every time I “make a move” in Fishland. That’s not getting items for Free as suggested by Temu. That’s being forced to do menial, time wasting tasks while they mine information, under the disguise of “free”. I couldn’t give it a single star because I do enjoy the prices. But don’t assume you’ll get free items when they tell you that you will.  Update: October 2023 I have permanently deleted Temu. Account, the app, etc. All my family will be following suit. I am absolutely disgusted with the amount of time I spent on this app playing “games” with the promise of “do what is required, win the rewards”. It’s a scam. You’ll waste time.

So Dec 15th I ordered a bunch of stuff with an expected arrival date of dec 20th-29th. I was a bit concerned about getting it after Christmas but whatever. Couple days isn’t a big deal. Long story short, it is now the 3rd of January. I have contacted them almost everyday since the 27 because there hasn’t been a single update to shipping since the 24th. Which didn’t show up in the tracking until the 30th. I have asked for my money back multiple times, and have been told to wait an additional 15 days, and if I don’t receive an update to the tracking by then, they will refund my money. So basically, as long as the tracking is updated every 15 days, you could never receive the package, but they won’t refund the money, because the tracking is updating. What a croc!

The great thing about the return process was they gave me a credit for the items (I was able to get a credit toward my next purchase or, they credit my debit card) the are so reasonably priced & everything was such a good quality & did not look cheap. The jewelry was amazing many rings I ordered were either sterling silver, platinum or 14 carat gold filled & it’s crazy because I paid less the. $5 for each item.   People actually thought I purchased them from a jewelry store because even the rings that were cubic zirconia looked so real.

I am sure with Christmas coming it will slow up a bit but it puts some of my domestic subscription boxes to shame for shipping times, I am not even kidding you. I timed a certain subscription box I get with a Temu order I did that sent the same day and I received the Temu order 2 days before the subscription box. Wild!!!!. I can not say enough good stuff about Temu. I have had 4-5 shipments and nothing has come damaged. One box it came in looked sad and I was wondering because items are usually loose, but nope everything was happy and safe inside. Some of the items inside were in their own puffy pouch too.

I know because my cousin has the one that is over $100 and my battery last longer than his. So if you have the time to just scroll through all of the items and just pick up a couple of things you need, I’ve never spent over $40 and I always got a lot.

Because some items have to be cleared through customs, orders may be separated in the delivery process which can be harder to track.

5,2023-05-27 20:50:17,"I’ve been buying from this app for over a month. So far I’ve had absolutely no problem with any of the products. I purchased tools for miniatures I purchased craft and art supplies. I purchased electronic gadgets and I’ve purchased household items. Everything has been exactly as I expected. Everything has been delivered within the timeframe that they’ve told me it would be actually they’ve been delivered the first day of their estimate when shipment even arrived early, I get no annoying ads I get no request to invite other people to download the app for bonuses. Nothing like that. The only mistake I’ve seen so far is that I had ordered 10 S hooks and they shipped me five I called customer support and they are re-shipping the missing five hooks no needing to make this shipment up to $10. No shipping charge no questions the woman I talk to was very professional and cheerful overall I am extremely happy with this site. The quality is better than I expected. I had used wish before and gotten totally scammed, so needless to say, I’ve been pleasantly surprised with my experience with Temu.",Love this app
5,2022-11-25 21:24:52,"So I was very skeptical about this app when my fiancée told me about it. I thought it was just going to be like another Wish where your items break 2 minutes later and it takes like three months or more to get your items. I don’t know how but somehow the prices are even cheaper than wish but the products are better quality. And the part I love the most is every few hours you can get free shipping on your entire order. And delivery is very quick. They usually ship your item out the day after or two days after you place the order and depending on where you live it usually gets to you within a week or so. We have like four orders each that we ordered on different days and we’ve already gotten 3 of the packages. I am very pleasantly surprised you’re not only with their items, but with the shipping. Also, my fiancée got the wrong color of something and they very quickly gave her a credit to get the other color within three minutes and as soon as it was about to ship. Very fast and friendly customer service! Love you TEMU!!!",Very pleasantly surprised!
4,2023-06-12 22:41:59,"Most of my purchases have been as expected, I have ordered quite a lot and try to always check the sizes before I buy to prevent dissatisfaction, so I shop wisely. Some of the items exceed my expectations of quality and most others are at what I expected. I have an order with a pair of leggings coming and it will be my first clothing purchase, so at this time I can’t comment on clothing. I have ordered diamond art and have been very happy. My makeup purchases have been above what I hoped for. I don’t order large or electronic items, I am not much of a risk taker. I did just get a electronic bark stop device for my insane barker Yorkie dog. I am not expecting success but will let you know later, instructions say up to 2 weeks to work. My biggest complaint would be a lot of the products instructions are not in English or are very poorly written and just contain no instructions at all, but I know for the prices I am paying I feel it is what should be expected and some frustration is going to be part of the game. Also the low prices are enticing me to spend too much! LOL, my own fault. Over all I am happy with your company",Quality of purchases
5,2023-04-24 22:27:39,"I got this app a few months ago, and now I'm addicted. Everything on here is so cheap, and all the time, Temu launches a big sale, some coupons, or even free gifts altogether. Some of their items can be a little sketchy, but as long as you're careful, you're practically guaranteed great products for the cheapest price out there.  What I've heard about Temu recently is completely the opposite from what I've personally experienced. All the products I've received have good quality, or at least acceptable for the price. I've only ever had one package come late, and when it did, they reimbursed me $10! Extremely rarely, you may find an item or two missing, but it's never anything detrimental.  While you may find something missing, or maybe an item doesn't work, you can still apply for a refund. In my case, they gave me a full refund and allowed me to keep the items, and I could donate it as I pleased! They have great customer service and I literally couldn't ask for better! Thank you Temu for the great products and cheap prices!",Never shopping anywhere else again!
1,2023-07-10 03:32:12,"Update: I have now heard from two people that their cards/accounts linked to Temu have been drained. So yeah one star. If you don't have it yet, don't get it. Stay safe.  I love that I can get decent quality stuff for low prices. I've spent quite a lot because so many things are so cheap. Temu is smart because they use games where you can win products or store credit, to keep you coming back. (Instead of buying a bunch of stuff once and then never using the app again.) Even smarter, the games often require you to complete tasks like browse for thirty seconds, make purchases, or interact with existing users or recommend new users. Here's the issue. They made the games ridiculously easy to win for the first few months, even without referring a new user, and EVERYONE was cashing out. Then they changed all of the games to be rigged so that you can't win without recommending someone new. But a lot of the games pretend to be chance/luck based. Spin the wheel types, but it's not really luck or chance at all. It's obviously calculated to be unwinnable and it's really frustrating and a bit insulting. I wish they would make the games ACTUALLY chance based, even if that means offering smaller prizes. The way they do it now makes them seem really skeevy and scammy, and damages the trust of their users.",Great shop BUT
1,2023-10-15 17:26:17,"Played this game for about 3 months, started playing because of the puzzles it starts out easy with just a small commitment each day. Not even super fun, but then I joined an alliance and started making friends in the game. I never spent money in the game and for to level 27 before deciding I had to quit. It takes more and more of your time and gets super addictive, till all you want to do is play. Each level is more difficult to achieve without spending real money, although you can play and have fun as long as you're part of an active alliance. You will end up paying with time instead of money. There is strategy involved, but you'll never reach where you want to be when vou reach on goal there's another just out of reach. The game also has a steep learning curve, if you decide to really play you'll spend hours trying to figure out generals, buff, debuffs, research, ghosting, battlefield, server vs server, and everything else. There's always more to do to compete. I'll say I enjoved while I played I made lots of friends had a great server, but in the end it took too much of my time so be aware what you're signing up for.

When i wished to checkout and place the order, I clicked on one of the credit cards that I had on file and a message from Temu popped up and said I and my financial company(who was that?) were disputing Temu charges so Temu was making changes to my account. I checked with my credit card companies and there was no such dispute. I and my credit card companies weren’t disputing anything. My credit number is 812! Meanwhile Temu sent me several messages saying the merchandise I wanted was selling out and that I should place the order. I tried, and they wouldn’t process the order. I tried contTEMU AND IT WAS A BAD JOKE. THEy kept asking ne what the order number was. I didn’t have an order number because Tenu wouldn’t process the order. So I am done with them.

5,2022-10-06 23:54:12,"Just purchased 14 items for $12, so we’ll see what the actual price points are like after the new user discount disappears. Seems similar to AliExpress, but with better shipping time, smaller range of products and competitive prices. Two things to be mindful of: 1, There is no favorites or wishlist option. If you want to save something, you have to put it in your cart. You do have the option of selecting and buying just one item, but there’s also the option of sleepily emptying the cart or purchasing everything when you’re just trying to do one of two items. 2, The ratings when you click on a product seem to be for the entire store. When I clicked the reviews to read others opinions, they were filled with other items, to the point that I never saw the item I was looking for in any of the review sections. Will try to remember to come back and update rating based on the quality of the products. I’m not expecting top-notch quality, but I would like to get a few uses out of each item before it possibly breaks.",Pretty good so far
5,2023-03-29 19:33:42,"I have to say of course I was skeptic like everyone else but I also happily once ordered off of Wish so I expected honestly nothing special. I was wrong. I ordered twice now from Temu and both times the product I ordered was exactly as described and I personally couldn’t be happier with the products I ordered. This second time I really really didn’t expect my order ( especially a 4-6 piece order) to be delivered in less then a week. I leave for a trip in less then 15 hours and wanted to take my items with me and am estatic they came in time! Honestly, I recommend this to anyone who like me wants to be able to actually be able to shop for items comfortably price range wise. Before the  pandemic was honestly the last time I was able to even think about shopping for anything that wasn’t 100% essential. It really is a nice feeling to get some new clothes that actually fit me and won’t set me back 5 paychecks to catch back up to where I was. Honestly, thank you Temu. Thank you thank you!",Ok ordered twice and both times couldn’t be happier!
2,2023-07-15 16:48:49,"Now before y’all read the rest of this just know I have yet to receive my items (i only ordered them a couple days ago) So I can’t speak on shipping or quality. HOWEVER with apps like these it’s safe to assume if it seems too good to be true it probably is. I don’t expect any of the items I got to be that high quality given the price and how these business models work. I would like to warn y’all of the “Freebies” they offer where you go through hoops to spins prize wheels, get energy (through inviting others), and then take a random chance to spin again for the prizes. It says you can invite 3 peo and it’s up to 2 energy per person but what they don’t tell you is the amount of energy you earn goes down with every person. They give you enough energy to get everything but one price on the wheel preventing you from winning all 3 things free. It leaves you 5 energy short and asks to invite others. The first person you invite gives 2 energy, (dope only 2 more invites and I can win my free stuff) but nah. The second invite gave me 1, then .5, then .2. Definitely a scam to get you to raise their downloads and users and I personally will be deleting it once I receive whatever it is I bought.",Honestly too good to be true
2,2023-07-02 20:48:44,"First i am going to say some of the products that you buy from Temu are really  awesome and the price makes it even better. But there have been a few times I’ve ordered something and the item i received was not anything like what was pictured. I have ordered several times and literally not one  single order has came where something wasn’t missing, broke, and one of my orders the whole entire order said it was delivered but not to me they delivered it to my address just in a different city about 5 hours from my actual house. The one thing about temu that gets on my nerves is the rigged games. I’m really starting to believe they are lying about real people actually winning these “free gifts” and whatnot . The games are literally rigged to where no one is going to win and the one time where some how I managed to actually win the $50 credit they didn’t give it to me In the game I had to go back and forth with customer service about it and thankfully I screen record everything and was able to show them that I won and then they had no choice but to give it to me.

They didn’t not just give me the option to take it as temu credit but told me afterwards that I had to ask before they proceed keeping mind I did, also it hasn’t been processed because it said the it will take up to 5-14 businesses days for the refund so it be processed, and then up to 30 days so I can receive my money back. After I spoke to 2 agents + 1 specialist they said it has already been processed and that it’s up to my bank when I receive the money. They said it would take DAYS but out of the nowhere when I ask if it would just be changed into credit they said it’s been processed in minutes? I have screenshots of the conversation, people should read at least some of the terms and conditions on things like the refund policy. It hasn’t even been half of the 30 days policy for me to get a refund, and it took like 15 minutes for me to get a refund so I don’t want the “you’re too late” excuse. I followed every rule and same as the policies but they send a random message “repeating” what they said about the order refund, but didn’t repeat they just changed the whole thing on which I was promised.",Changed policy mid conversation
5,2022-11-27 17:38:33,I was very skeptical of this site. I'm not a risk taker. But I was board and thought I'd start small and just purchase a few items. Well that turned into 3 hours of shopping in the comfort of my cozy home. My first order was 5 identical Christmas outfits for my preschool class. The deal was amazing and the picture of the outfit was soooooo darling. The total was $30. I was prepared to be disappointed. When I opened that package I felt and seen the outfits. I was in LovE!!!! They are the cutest!!!! I'm so excited to gift them. The next day I got my big order of about 40 random things. My daughter and I made a game out of it. First let me tell you this is the daughter that yells at me for buying junk or over priced items on Facebook . So she was in full mode ready to laugh at me!!! We opened and took one item out at a time. Said if it was quality or junk and then I made her guess the price I paid. She guessed higher on most everything!!! She was smiling and said okay mom you did good 😊. It's just a fun and addicting site. I give it 5 stars!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,Pleasantly surprised!!!

When I first ordered I was very  skeptical and didn’t expect much for the price I was even warned by a few people to not buy from Temu because it was all junk but I decided to take a chance anyway. I ordered a few little inexpensive things and figured “what the heck” if it’s junk I only lost a few bucks but much to my surprise the stuff was actually pretty good! I think only one item was defective, a small clock that was not working when I received it but Temu kindly gave me a refund on the clock. I’m beginning to purchase more items on Temu and I keep being pleasantly surprised at the quality of the items I order. Now I’m sure every now & then I’m going to order something that may not be of the best quality but so far so good. At the prices they sell things for I can’t really complain if an item turns out not to be of the best quality. So far I’m happy with the items I’ve purchased on Temu and I will keep buying from them.

1,2023-07-12 00:36:49,"When using the app, there’s too many pop ups for discounts. What really frustrated me to write this review is that Temu was offering 5 free items of your choice from a list of items as long as you sent referral codes. After going through a series of about 5 pop ups to get money off to obtain the “free” items, it states to invite a friend and get the final $3 off to obtain the “free” items. I sent the link to a friend right next to me, whom never used Temu before. They clicked the link, downloaded and created their account. They were then bombarded with several pop ups. On my end, the app stated that my referral link had been used. It said that I could check the use under “invitations” which didn’t provide any information or indicate my link was used, however, I was given $1.20 off for inviting my friend. Temu then asked me to invite another friend to get the remaining $1.80 which is confusing since it told me I would get $3. Temu is playing a game, and therefore, I do not recommend because they aren’t making it easy to just shop. I don’t want to jump through hoops to buy clothes. I did spend $200 on some items for my daughter, however it hasn’t arrived yet so I can’t speak on the quality. I can only review the app at this time.",Too many fake discounts…

Additionally, if they do ship your items, they are all poorly packaged and arrive severely damaged — even to the extent of not being able to use the item.

I was sent wrong size, or it did not work, but I was refunded it in a timely manner and they said keep it.   That made me happy because I hate returning things or having to drive to the post office.   Surprisingly every thing arrived on time but once and this time I was refunded $5.00, without even saying anything about it.      In USA even some stores only let you return with a restocking 30 percent fee of what you paid for the item.   No driving all over town looking for what you want.   I do wish they had some more expensive items, in many things.   Overall I still give it a 5 stars.      Remember they send you discounts OFTEN so check your mail for promotions.

They are pretty good about giving you your money back when something arrives broken. I received one pair of pants that were good quality and another that were made out of the cheapest paper feeling fabric I’ve ever seen. If what you need is a piece of plastic that doesn’t do anything you could probably trust that item. Like Legos figures, they snap together and look like the real thing but definitely don’t buy anything you need to rely on. We bought a chicken coop door with an automatic open close feature with a timer. It only worked for a month and crapped out. We bought solar phone chargers that were supposed to mega capacity and it can’t charge a small desk fan for a few hours. I also heard on Reddit that Temu uses child labor to keep prices low and shipping fast so I’m not a fan of abusing children to make plastic crap cheaper. A dragon figurine I bought spears to have been painted by a child or a very sloppy adult. The “prizes” they give you are just a ploy to unload more plastic crap and make you buy more to get it.

Because you can find the same items through Shein with more discounts, and ship faster but the more important is their package come with safety. I shopped twice times on this app and both times the delivery was awful, and all products were mistreated and it always comes in a regular bag, not as they show in their advertisements in boxes, I think that they only do this with the influencers to be able to sell and that is the wrong attitude from Temu to customers since we are the consumers by paying them not them, even if the products are free for them I don't recommend this app unless you don’t care the safety your products. ¡La verdad es que Temu no es una buena aplicación! Porque puede encontrar los mismos artículos a través de Shein con más descuentos y enviar más rápido, pero lo más importante es que su paquete venga con seguridad. Compré dos veces en esta aplicación y las dos veces la entrega fue horrible, y todos los productos fueron maltratados y siempre viene en una bolsa normal, no como muestran sus anuncios en cajas, creo que eso solo lo hacen con los influencers para poder vender y esa es la actitud incorrecta de Temu hacia los clientes, ya que somos los consumidores al pagarles, no a ellos, incluso si los productos son gratuitos para ellos.

4,2023-01-28 16:24:06,I give this site 4 stars mostly it is a good site to find some good items at great deals. My issue is a couple things when things go on sale like really high like 50% to 90% off they inflate the price and put a slash through it and say it’s normally this price and it’s marked down from the inflated price x amount and these are the items you see regularly and know that they are like always 22$ but on this super sale they will be 90$ slashed thru and be 32$ for example and then they go back down when the period is over to they’re regular price second issue is the games u play where invites are the key to getting free stuff never will a spin or pick a hat or card etc… whatever the game is it will always get u the best prize the first two and then make u struggle for the last three dollars or whatever to get the prize I think we should be able to pay for more coins or somthing because they don’t let u spam invites and must do so to even get the prize all in all its an ok site if u know how to work it and or if u just want to buy stuff,Some things good Some things bad.

My daughter made me download it after she saw reviews on TikTok and her friends had made purchases. The products are for the most part better quality than you typically would get from a website like Wish or SHEIN…. At least what we have gotten so far. Also, the tracking and order processing updates are great. If there is a delay, they let you know and credit your account! I had one item that was broken when it arrived, but they were quick to refund my account in mere minutes. I honestly haven’t done a lot of the games or referrals for freebies— but I’m just satisfied with getting the products I am at good prices. There is something there for everyone— check it out, and read reviews. Also, if you do shopping on Etsy, I recommend checking on this site that the same product isn’t being sold on Temu for less than half the price it’s listed on Etsy.","My daughter made me do it, and I’m glad she did!"

Sometimes items come in the wrong way that doesn’t mean to take it out on the rest of the great stuff that comes out of this company. I would say the prices are great and a lot of everything works out just also sometimes the material is a little weird and it’s not something I always like but the company is great about returns and how they deal with it as well as refunds the refunds which I really appreciate the customer service is always very nice and pleasant,  The shirts are soft and they feel nice,here and there a little Problem with the sizing, sometimes too small as well as too big, but most of the time it is just right, and the company is always very good at taking care of the situation and you feel like they’re there to help but overall like I said before the company is good, it’s great when you have a budget.👍👍",Temu
3,2023-08-09 21:34:20,"So far, I’ve experimented with the experience of using the app and while the whole experience is based around users impulsively spending money and inviting more people to download the app, the app also offers a bunch of free stuff. The only catch is, you better be in it for the long game because there's plenty of opportunity for them to 'get you' and drain you of your time and energy in the meantime. It's very misleading and they continue to change the rules and how their games are played. For example, there's a mini game called Fishland and you have to feed a certain amount of fish to win free goods, except the fish gradually become harder to feed and take more food to feed them, It also get gradually harder to get fish food and takes longer and longer. It's a constant dangling of the carrot. It's meant to frustrate you and make you break down and just buy what they're offering.   I'll give a higher rating when the mini games and free offers feel less like a carnival game and make it worth my time.. probably would incentivize me to buy more by not feeling gyped all the time.","Pretty cool, but the free stuff isn’t all that free"

It’s using this information you give it such as your adeeess phone number and name, but have you noticed it asks for permission for your location and the ability to track your browsing across other sites, social media profiles, and ( you would never know) but it is stealing your texts conversations too. ALSO THEY HAVE YOUR CREDIT CARD!  “Ok, your conspiracy theorist” you might be saying, but just realize, this is made by the same company who created the app pinduoduo, which is a whole other can of worms, but basically you needed to reset your entire phone if you ever downladed it, because of the malware it enstilled once downloaded. yeah. Temu has not been proven to have stolen as much info orenstilled as much malware as pinduoduo (as of yet) but the other stuff Temu stole id proven. Who knows what else thé have stolen?

1,2023-07-04 12:14:34,Are the prices extremely low? Yes. Is the quality of the things your getting any good? Yes. Is it even real? Yes. BUT. The customer service and the third party carriers they use don’t make any of those things worth it. I have ordered from Temu multiple times and I’ve only received one of my orders. The package tracking is inaccurate. The communication between Temu and any carrier they use seems like next to none. I would check up on my packages. Track them. I would even call customer service for Temu and what ever shipping handler is supposedly delivering my order.  The first time I ordered from Temu I never even go my package. Even tho my address was correct in the app they still sent my package to the wrong address. They told me they’d fix it and I’d be receiving my package. 4 days later I get an email stating my package was already sent back to the sender. It was irritating and frustrating.  If I’m going to buy from your company have better communication with your carriers. At this point I’m deleting my account. It’s not worth it. After the 4th time that I’ve not received anything I’ve bought it doesn’t make the hard to believe prices worth it. Absolutely ridiculous. Do not buy from Temu.  Worst experience I’ve ever had.,DO NOT USE TEMU

I love how I can find stuff for pretty cheap here that anywhere else would be more expensive, so no problems with the quality of the products that they have. The only thing I’m not too just about is the courier service. Seriously the last few packages in a row have been delivered by CDL and they don’t even update on time when the package is out for delivery or when it has arrived. So the package will sit wherever it is placed for a while before it’s retrieved or stolen. The notification does not come at the time that they drop it off or whatever so if it’s not on secure area that is a window of time that it could’ve been stolen before the recipient even gets it. And I get that the company doesn’t choose which career service as courier services may depend on what service is available at that time. But never in a time that I’ve been ordering till now have I consistently gotten the same courier service each time. I just wish they would look for another service that may be available because honestly USPS, UPS, FedEx, or DHL is a lot more reliable than CDL is right",Great app but…

I really wanted the shoes though. Now my biggest issue is I haven’t received my refund for the of $54 dollars and some cents.

Everything came in tact, within a week, and it gave me constant updates on where my packages were. It’s insanely cheap, so I was definitely skeptical, despite a bunch of my friends/family have confirmed it’s legit. It does have a $10 minimum for each order, with free shipping. I’ve seen some people complaining about that, but like let’s be real $10 is reasonable considering they’re giving you free shipping & crazy cheap stuff. They need to make money too! lol. The “free gift” stuff is kind of a give or take. I have quite a few friends who have actually gotten those 5 free gifts, but you need to have A LOT of friends (who don’t have temu) in order to get them and it takes a decent amount of time. they make it difficult on purpose which is annoying, but then again who would make it easy and give millions of people free things everyday?

My mom got a pair of shoes in the mail and told me she only paid $4.50 for them. So I said “From where?!“ And she said “This company called Temu“. I was EXTREMELY suspicious bc I had never heard of them but I had to try it out. I bought a pair of shoes for get this…$1.18!!!!! It was a new user discount (never got my new user gift cards though) And I was so surprised by the quality! I can’t wear them because they are half a size too small, but that was my own fault. They refunded me the money even though I wanted to exchange the shoes. Anyway, I have since become addicted. I am waiting on literally four different orders right now.

4,2023-04-09 00:45:03,"Tbh,  I am extremely impressed with TEMU the first 3 months that I have been ordering from this site/app. Shipping is/was extremely fast (for items coming overseas) but lately, there has been majors delays on their shipment. Very unusual.  However, what I love from it is that it gives you automatically $5 credit if there is a delay from their 14 range for delivery.  Normally it takes a day or two longer.  Also, I like the constant offering of coupons for $12 less if you order $60 or more.  So far I had spent over $600 in a large amount of items.  I had invited friends and family alike because of the great prices.  I used it use Ali  x pre ss but it has taken forever to ship items to USA. Over a months to some of them. Also, I still have a problem with a seller that doesn’t want to honor a price on their site, I never going back to that place.  So far, TEMU has been a breath of good initiative and quick response….

However, right away you could tell the hand wraps were cheap made from low quality fabric. One of the wraps was damaged without even being used. They both went to the garbage. I figured because I paid for what I got - cheap unusable stuff. My second order included 4 items. The package came in a month later. I was at the point where I was ready to dispute the charge on my credit card. Just like the first order, everything looked horrible and went into the garbage. The app asked me for reviews. When I was trying to put a one star review, a message popped out asking me to contact the customer service. I contacted the customer service through the chat and told the person what happened to the items received. Without any hesitation, the customer service representative offered me a full refund and I received the refund instantly on my PayPal account which was only positive experience I had with TEMU.

1,2023-04-26 14:33:29,"I was doing the ‘Hat-Trick Draw’ game to win a number of items, but they make it incredibly hard to actually win. After getting all the free energy points, I needed about 16 energy left within 24 hours, and the only way to get more energy was to invite friends. Here’s where the scam takes place. They report you can have up to 3 existing accounts  accept your invite for 1-3 energy a piece, or have new users register using your generated game link for an unlimited amount of times which would give you 1-5 energy a piece. Issue is that when your needed energy goes below 12, it doesn’t give you 1-3 or 1-5, it gives 1. One. A single energy. So after 24 hours of soliciting my friends and family to download an app that’s promising me a free item bundle, I make it down to only 1 energy needed (meaning I have more or less needlessly got 10-15 of my contacts to click a sketchy link just to help me) when the hard stop timer resets and kills my game. Because Temu lied about how much energy they would ACTUALLY give you per successful invite, I wasted 24 hours of time and annoyed relatives and made them think they were risking their internet security to get literally nothing out of it.

When I inquired with customer service why this would happen, I got zero real response. My chat experience started at 2:06 pm. I finally received communication from Darwin, offering to help at 2:35 pm. Whatever, it's days before Christmas, and they had a convenient queue countdown letting me know I started at 252 in the waiting line. I wasn't particularly in a hurry, so I waited it out. I asked Darwin why my order was refunded, and I got the same stock answer twice: ""In order to protect the safety of your funds..."" Listen, Darwin, I heard you the first time, and you still haven't actually told me why my order was refunded. PayPal was happy to pay it, as was American Express. So anyway, Darwin was no help. He told me he had informed a supervisor and ghosted me. The customer service did not get better from there.

Don’t do it guys. Less you got like a whole family who are going to the “new Temu users who have NEVER downloaded the app before”. Cuz the existing user is limited to 4. So basically, you had to start inviting new users at one point to cut the price. But by that time, each person you invite will cut less and less. In my case, I have 60 cents left after my 4 existing users. So I thought one new user would be enough to go to zero. But when I got that new user, it only cut the price by 20 cents. And the next one, would cut by 10, and less and less. Basically, as I said, less you got a whole family or friends who are going to be new users, you ain’t gon get it y’all.

It’s takes like months if it gets delayed it will take even longer it took my stuff like 3 months I literally i almost forgot I ordered it the thing I wish they would get rid of the 10$ you have to spend it’s honestly annoying and they would have more games cause most of the time the people I share with already played the games or people could make games of their owns for people to play and the delivery doesn’t take forever 😑,Package wasting issue and lack of games to play and delive takes forever

1,2023-05-03 00:13:45,"Go to the Better Business Bureau if you want to see true reviews of Temu. Customer support is basically nonexistent for Temu, and they don't assist customers at all. Temu needs to use trustworthy shipping companies that don't lose huge orders. All of the hours out of days that I spent to find the items that I needed and then order them are down the drain! The order was lost and now Temu expects me to go back through and find the items all over again because the order link does not separate the lost items from the delivered items. It shows that it does, but whenever I click on the shipped but not delivered link, it only takes me back to the entire order altogether. It's far too inconvenient and too time-consuming to do this all over again. Also, on the Wish app, I can save over 1500 items within my wish list. It's the same for the wish list in the Shein app. Temu needs to allow much more to be saved on their wish list because this would make re-ordering items that Temu lost so much easier and much quicker.

However, there are “games” where they say “earn $$$” or “earn $$$ credit”, but it’s pretty impossible to do. And when you try to back out they give a pop up that says “this person earned $$$$” and put up an impossible amount of money!!! I tried a cookie jar game, where it says “invite new players to drop cookies faster.” I did this, it says “100 cookies = $1”… but guess what!!! After you hit the redeem button you then have to spin to earn the money! 1000 cookies equals 1 spin.. and the closer you get, the less you get.. first couple spins was 20 vouchers of 100, but once i got to 93 vouchers of 100, suddenly i was only getting pennys.

The app itself is designed like a microtransaction pay to play game, with all of these little gimmicks trying to get you to “win money” or “get free items” but they are all designed to make you spend even more money. There’s one where they promise a free item and let you choose it. But then you have to earn it by grinding on this app day after day, sending links to friends, pretending to feed these fish, and the closer you get to your goal the harder it makes it, where every drop in the bucket “feeding the fish” contributes less and less. It’s all a cheap scam. By the last day you’re able to do the event, each feeding contributes to 0.01% of the total for the one fish. It’s manipulative and a waste of time. If you want to buy the stuff, just use the website. The app also has built in ad trackers so they’re tracking your views and purchases and selling that information, just like Facebook and others do.

I did not realize this when I decided to try temu, I wish I had known.  And you get what you pay for…of the 25 items I ordered, 11 were so bad I returned them or threw them away. Some were totally defective (like a meat tenderizer that the silver finish rubbed off and turned my hands black when i tried to wash it with regular dish soap), some were  not as pictured/described (weird gathering stitches on a blouse, ‘stretchy’ shoelaces that weren’t actually stretchy at all, shorts where the fabric in person is shiny and stiff instead of matte and drapey the way it looked in the photos), some seem possibly dangerous (a dog cooling mat that was cool but must have some weird chemicals on it b/c my dog who loves to lay on EVERYTHING refuses to go near it).  So basically it seems too good to be true and it definitely is. The one good thing is returns were easy and customer support was helpful when I had to contact them.

The limit for being able to check out is also frustrating because it goes up everytime we/i buy something. It’s hard to go up to that limit when we don’t know what to buy. There could be a feature where on the weekend we could have no limit on purchasing items without having to worry about the spending limit. The games are sometimes rigged and it’s hard to get new users. I wish there was a bigger limit for existing users. If the games are luck based I think it will be better because there’s more chances than actually getting new users. I understand that new users are important because new users equals more people using the app and buying stuff.

Every thing was there but 1 item had a piece missing.  I went into my delivery email and I was able to report it and this company immediately initiated a refund.

Except getting the free stuff part, you have to invite friends and do a bunch of other things just to get a few things for free. But overall I love to shop on here because even though it’s cheap, the products are still amazing and look almost like they should cost more than what their worth.

For example: if I purchased an item and got a $100 coupon bundle; you can’t choose it and spend it with items you’ll purchase.

I'm not understanding why I wasn't given more than 30 on the new user I inivited. & then when I invited the other two users I was only given 15 tokens all together which leaves me 5 tokens away from spinning the wheel. Except now I would have to invite yet another new person in order to actually spin the wheel when the app keeps saying I was only 1 invite away from winning. You guys have a way of making people think they have a chance at actually winning when they really don't. Oh and not only that when you get to needing only a few dollars like $3 for example to win the wheel purposely only allows you to win $1 instead of $2, $3, or $5. It's completely set up to get people to constantly keep inviting others. It's not meant for you to actually win so it's quite unfair.",Wish I could give this app a negative star rating
5,2023-06-13 17:43:43,"I ordered a bunch of stuff off of temu thinking it might be a scam, but I was pleasantly surprised to see a good amount of quality in the items I got! I got some airpods in a cute case for a few dollars and they work great and have a super cute case that apple could never provide. I also got a really sturdy and elegant case for my iPad, along with a few other small things. There are some downsides of course, like how the bag I received my items in was rather messy, and one of my items, (a shoe rack made with some plastic) was broken on arrival. I got a refund though and I didn't need to send the item back. The refund I chose was for temu store credit but you can also ask for an actual money refund if you are willing to wait for a good month or so. The shipping took a couple of weeks but I could track my package in the app and receive text alerts for its status. Overall, why not try it?

I have to get help with them, only for a couple of cents. Those are pretty much not worth it. I was supposed to get $20 off my first order, it didn't say that there were any limitations or anything like that, as long as I use the app to place my order. I still spent $21 and something cents, and if I went by the terms of what I could read in the coupon, I should've spent a Dollar somehthing. a lot of it doesn't make any sense.

5,2023-04-05 06:46:10,"Very good quality items for the price and are as shown in the app. Bought several ties, suit vests, and collectibles from here at incredible prices! Aside from shipping times ranging from 2-3 weeks, the price and selection here is fantastic. You can find anything from 99 cent jewelry to entire gaming consoles!   The free gift system, like the money tree and the fishing game in the app, is very much geared towards getting new users to sign up. Although they do offer several free items, it’s very difficult to attain said items. Makes sense, especially considering the already low cost of the items sold. I wish they would adjust this system to allow for more chances at these “gifts”, even if it involves less gifts.   Overall the app performed better than expected, items were as shown and the new selections they have every day make me genuinely excited to purchase more items. This app has made gift giving an adventure once again!",Very Impressed
5,2022-12-25 01:24:30,"I was introduced to Temu through an ad on FB. I quickly went from there to it’s website to it’s app. I’ve never downloaded a shopping app or ordered from one. But this one immediately caught my interest. Temu’s shops carry EVERYTHING. Interesting jewelry, enamel pin, art prints, tarot cards, fingerless gloves, colored pencils, and wonderful scrapbooking/journal supplies.   Despite the ridiculously low prices and free shipping that screams “SCAM!,” I decided to order. I received my order and I can’t complain about what arrived. Several things that I ordered, I had ordered from other sources. I chose them as gifts and to compare quality. They passed the test, except for one necklace that looked cheap. Of course, it was cheap. The most frequent complaint I’ve encountered here has been the size of item. Of what I’ve ordered, the jewelry, prints, gloves, all have been the size expected. The scrapbook material often runs small, but I’ve experienced that from other vendors.","Well, I’m enjoying it."

And even if people burly have the app to accept your request, it’s not gonna work sometimes which is a scam because once they accept your request they can’t accept it again then your gonna have to ask someone else to download the app and it’s not gonna work and what if it takes a long time or if it’s damaged or something that makes the problem cause some anger because you wasted your whole time on something that you really wanted.

The sheer variety and quality of their offerings combined with their competitive prices are a shopper's dream come true.  Temu has consistently impressed me with their commitment to affordability. They've managed to strike a balance between quality and cost that's truly commendable. Whether I'm looking for tech gadgets, accessories, or everyday essentials, I've found their prices to be incredibly reasonable.  But it's not just about affordability – it's also about the fantastic products they offer. The range is vast, and I've discovered unique and high-quality items that I wouldn't have come across otherwise. It's like a treasure trove of practical and fun finds.  What's equally noteworthy is the user-friendly shopping experience. Their website or app is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through their product offerings and place orders. Plus, their customer service has been responsive and helpful in case I've had any questions or concerns.  In summary, Temu has been my go-to destination for affordable and fantastic products. It's a place where you can shop with confidence, knowing you'll get excellent value for your money. If you're looking for a budget-friendly and enjoyable shopping experience, I highly recommend giving Temu a try.

Then came TEMU! Sometimes I order two or three times a day! I will sit down for a minute and in the past I never picked up my cell phone. Now I pick it up to just browse through Temu, not to buy just to look and see what is new! I am not a browser never have been. I am a buyer and every time I sit down I pick up my phone and find more things I HAVE to have! So, I order again! I never did before but I think now I know what the word addicted means!

I’ve even found some nifty household gadgets, as well as some tech gadgets for my husband. if you’re looking for a great place to shop, then you need to download this app!

1,2023-08-18 20:49:25,"Temu has been lieing and scamming a lot. First off all, a lot of the products are fake and aren't what it shows and it is actually something much more expensive or not even in the app. Secondly, they say they have ""free gifts"" when in reality they don't. They make you send an unreasonable amount of invites to people you know to ""cut-off"" money from a FREE gift, and you have to get it all the way to zero, you can't get have anything left. I sent countless invites, and downloads, but it just got to the point where i had $1.20 left but it made me cut a couple cents off per people downloading the app... What a scam! Thirdly, they have been doing very illegal activity and the devs of the app store really needs to ban Temu, because they been commiting false advertisement, and they been putting fake reviews. About 90% of Temu's 5 star and 4 star reviews are fake, in reality this app has more 1 stars than anything. I seen someone complain on this app about some of the stuff I said, and they gave Temu a one star, but then Temu came and hacked them and changed their one star to a five star, they will most likely do the same to me (or now they might not cause i said that).",Wish I could give 0 stars...
2,2023-05-15 23:00:19,"Here’s the thing. There are some really cool things on the app for cheap; however, there are a few things that could be improved. 1st, everyone should be a able to have a wish list. All of the app’s competitors allow all their users to have one, and it diminishes the experience of shopping with Temu that they don’t give one to everyone. They also have a minimum check out amount that other competitor apps do not have, if I am specifically looking for one thing, I don’t want to spend more than I need to. My other complaint is actually with their free gifts. Most are impossible to get unless you have a social media following. Not many people know a new app user or have a bunch of people they can share the link to. Also for many of the games, they purposely make it incredibly difficult or impossible to obtain. I get it, it’s a free gift, but some of their information is incredibly misleading or inaccurate. I’m not sure it’s worth spending the time on their free gift programs. I recently was finally going to get a free gift and then the app mysteriously timed out. Coincidence, maybe, maybe not.",Well…

I received two of the 6 items i ordered. One was a Stanley cup that came chipped all over the sides and the description said it came with a straw but it didn't. i also ordered an led light light strip that didn't work. the packaging was terrible and ripped up so i requested a return. it was ""accepted"" so i sent my stuff in the mail and explained how i didn't even receive the other 4 items in the little reason for return box and i wanted a refund and the next day my card had no refund, no email, and my app suddenly crashed and i couldn't open it anymore i tried redownloading and every time i log into my old account it ""doesn't exist"" and when i make a new account all of a sudden it works. point is its a scam it may look all exciting but its all fake. its been weeks and i still havent heard anything.",terrible fake app

4,2023-05-02 08:46:39,"I love Temu…almost too much! It’s great for customers that are okay with knockoffs. For some things like arts and crafts, they’re amazing. The silicone molds for example are great deals along with natural stone beads; however, there are a lot of misleading products and flat out false representations too. I’ve purchased various stone jewelry where they’re not the actual stone but an image with resin on top like their agate earrings or a glass bead with iridescence atop being sold as moonstone. You have to use common sense and sometimes heavily rely on reviews. Their customer service and return policies are awesome. So awesome it’s questionable like they know they’re selling you crap… there are some decent dealers on here though and it’s worth looking around. I’ve purchased items for personal, birthdays, holidays, and resale. Do yourself a favor if you’re purchasing in bulk and don’t just assume what they’re saying is true or what the package says is true. Investigate it. They have great deals for a reason.

Googled the company, read reviews online and here in the App Store, and decided to take a chance. I ordered a diamond painting kit, 3x Golden Snitch spinners, a red diamond painting tray, a retro NES game system, a diamond painting storage tray, and neon stickers. The red tray is foam, and got bent up in shipping in the bag with the other items, but I’ve placed it under a book to try straightening it out. Everything came within 10 days of ordering, and I think I spent just over what I would have given for the NES retro system alone. Granted, it’s not the officially licensed system, but it’s enough to give my kids a taste of my childhood to see if investing in the throwback is something to do. So far I am satisfied, and will order again. I just wish there were wishlists, instead you add everything to your cart, deselect what you don’t want currently, then what you don’t order stays there.

I went to their customer service and told them I put everything in the package and they kept me waiting for a long time and then told me the warehouse told them they didn't receive it!  To be honest, all I can know is that I sent it out, and I should not be responsible for whether there are too few items or not, right?  I don't know what their customer service is.  !

Well I am happy to say I am up to now 3 bigger orders and so far all have been excellent. Even bought some shirts which have been TRUE TO SIZE I know right!

They compress everything so it’s like a bunch of vacuum storage bags… and boy did they plump up… I couldn’t get the clothes back into the box! I got 2 very nice winter coats for my grandkids and they fit perfect. I will say you need to pay attention to the sizing charts for each item. That includes purses or toys…EVERYTHING. It does tell you their measurements.   I have since made 2 more larger purchases. One came yesterday and unfortunately I have to return 2 of the items. 1 pair of jeans and a dress w/hoodie. They are just too big. BUT : it was very simple to do the return. They send you the postage slips to print out and you just drop at the post office, super easy!  Waiting on my next order as we speak.

That was especially interested in how there’s a variety of items that you can get from the platform. Some are winners and some are less than desired but it’s incredibly nice and quite fantastic. The only detail that I saw was that you must have a $10 minimum so that everything can come very fast to your home.

You literally have to share this app with 5+people in order to actually win. And when playing the games they lessen your chances of winning each day, they only way to really gain the tokens, water, or whatever you need you must purchase items for $20 or more , or invite a new user to use the app constantly. But other than that shopping on here is pretty cool and you can’t beat the prices!",It’s actually really good!
5,2023-08-26 16:16:09,"So I’ve had this happen with some of the little games they have on there and I’m a little upset. For the longest time I have been doing farm land ,sending link so people can accept them and I can get my free items. It says each time you either get 1$ or 2$ and I’m to the point where I only get one dollar each wear I harvest n now that I was at 1 dollar left before I could get them all free,i harvested a wear plant and only got 50¢. I was like ok that’s fine i guess I’ll just harvest another wear plant and get another 50¢. I only get 30¢, this is what really te the frosting on the cake because it took me almost 1/2 weeks jus to get to the end and only get half of what I need, don’t get me wrong I love the app but not the little games they have that make it seem all scam-ish. The app isn’t a scam but it’s crazy someone can wait all that time jus to get a little portion of what they need. I LOVE THE APP THO🤍",Upset a little but love the app
3,2023-02-17 18:04:54,"I was referred by a friend of mine and my friend was supposed to Hera free gift afterwards but never did. I’ve purchased some things from here and some things seem like good quality then others are made cheap. I’ve tried many of the games to win free items and honestly they all seem like a scam. For the “hat draw” game regardless of what you choose the first two are it and the 3rd isn’t and then they want you to share. For the price cut one, you’ll always wind up getting the highest amount off but then you can get it unless “you refer someone” which even then you still probably won’t. Fishland and farmland seem a bit less sketchy but what I realized with Fishland when you have less fish it takes a lottttt more food to feed them. Like sometimes 10g of food won’t get go up 1%. All and all ik this is getting long but I have gotten one free gift (not from a referral nor a game). There was this deal if I spend more than $45 or something I can pick a free gift which I am waiting for my order to be delivered.",It’s cool but has disadvantages
5,2023-05-16 21:27:43,"I heard about Temu, I’m not sure how it was on TV I think or a friend maybe the news I don’t know. But it had me curious so I downloaded the app and checked it out. I bought two bags. The first bag was $13 the second bag was $83. Both bags came on the same day. I bought everything from magic erasers to a six dollar drone. My package came quick took about a week. I was updated and I could track my package. That was cool. It was super inexpensive for the amount of things I got. I was cautiously, optimistic, thinking that most of my purchases would probably be trash. I was wrong. Every single thing I got, and I cannot emphasize that enough, every single thing that I got was far better than I expected, and it exceeded all of my expectations the price is so incredibly low. I don’t know how these people are doing it, but keep doing what you’re doing because I am a believer. I am a lifetime temu’er!",First time Temu’er/ Why’d I wait this long?
1,2023-06-07 21:34:03,"I signed up because I saw an ad for Temu and it stated that new users could get a Nintendo switch for $7. I had to wait until 10:00pm to buy the switch as that was what time their flash sale supposedly started (even though that was never made known until after the sign up and download of the app). I set an alarm 5 minutes before so I could buy it immediately. I got the page ready and exactly when the clock turned to 10:00 pm (like to the millisecond), I tried to buy it and the app said they were sold out. And now, today, they are running the same ads, saying people can get the switch, new users only. They are advertising falsely. Either they are sold out or they’re not. There is a difference between being able to buy a switch for $7 and a slim chance at being able to do so. They a scam company and I plan to report them to the better business bureau. Maybe I can team up with other people and file a class action lawsuit against the company.  This is a terrible business practice. I will be returning all the products I purchased yesterday. I would suggest people stay away from this company.",False promises scam
5,2023-10-21 07:12:08,"I’m not the type of person to promote certain stores or websites. This all changed when I came across Temu. I know this sounds cheesy but let me explain. I am a diehard saltwater inshore and offshore fisherman. There is nothing more heartbreaking than losing twenty dollar lure s offshore fighting a large fish. This is why Temu excites me. Your lures and very similar as the expensive 20-30 lures at a fraction of the cost. When I say a fraction, I’m talking I can buy four or five big lures  from Temu for the cost of one at the popular box stores. Here’s the kicker. The ones at the box stores say “Made in China” and are probably made at the same facility as the ones Temu sells. I’ve been telling all of my fishing buddies and sending them pictures of what I’ve been ordering. They too started order mostly lures from Temu too. As long as the lures hold up, I’ll be buying many many more in the future. Thanks again Temu.",Spreading the news
2,2023-05-01 22:19:43,"Ima be honest i’d like to give it a 3 or 4 star but there’s a bunch of things i want to talk about. i’m not sure if anyone will see this but whatever. I know i’m not the only one who thinks Temu chooses the things for you when you play the games. For example; the credit game, it gives many options of cents, tickets, and then the big one which is 100 credits. I honestly think that’s a total rip off, and especially because Temu is cheap and that’s the reason why i like it and it has many things at such a good price yet the app is so like so bad. Plus, i don’t even know why they added a minimum of 10$ when you buy something. I tried buying something of 0.35 cents with the credits i earned by the games. When i saw it had to be a 10$ minimum, i was very disappointed. i don’t know if this app is a scam, or just likes ripping people off just to pay the price. Doesn’t even let me buy something with the credits i win. But overall, i guess i like it for how cheap it is and has many good things, the games are fun to earn despite the fact it choose for you though.",Temu App
4,2023-10-12 15:22:33,"I love Temu. I order almost everything I buy from here and am usually satisfied 90 percent of the time. You have to watch the size on things cause it may be behind a couch but be 8 by 19 but really did you think something that big was 2.98 ? They’re great about refunds and price adjustments if the price goes down in 30 days. All in all I have never ordered from a place that works so hard to please you. And if your order is late they compensate you 5 bucks! What?!😳The only reason they got four stars instead of 5 is because sometimes I feel like customer service gets a little persnickety with me but it’s hard to tell in a text. And they have a spot called earn credits I think where you can pick out a free item if you order. It gives you a bonus back an extra 5 percent off. Not to crazy about the games cause they start off fast but slow down to where it takes forever to get anything. But all in all,they rock!",Temu is awesome.
1,2023-05-18 04:35:33,"I actually was pleasantly surprised with this company after receiving a few things. We have now ordered quite a bit from household items, clothes, beauty, health and many many more categories. Shipping about 10 days, but free. Unfortunately, they also have games they encouraged to win rewards when goal reached. It’s great initially even when sending invite to temu app to people (expanding their customer base), which should be mutually beneficial and appreciated. However, at the end of game over weeks of time, suddenly problems from worst to the worst double talk excuses/reasons of issue, unresolved after a lot of time on chat, there reasons from “randomly”, “high risk”, “security reasons”. Yep, I think HLS might of trained customer service in unintelligible jargon in hopes it’s believable their app vetted for top level clearance and instantly blocked invites sent, never received at the end when reaching reward promised. I will not hold my breath waiting for supervisor to investigate and call me with a resolution. Just feel unethical to use good customers who bring more and losing them, as well as ones they brought with their practices shared.",Questionable Practices
5,2023-04-15 15:23:15,"I tried Temu for the first time about 6 months ago. I was buying silly little things for my kids, and honestly I couldn’t care less the “quality.” The price was unbeatable so I went for it. When it arrived I was SHOCKED by the items. They were exactly what I was hoping I would get. I ended up placing another order that same week and this time I was ordering things for me. I hate buying clothes online bc the cheaper they are, the cheaper they usually feel. I gave it a shot and now my favorite shirts I got from Temu. I have told all of my friends and family about it and I have placed multiple orders myself. The shipping is always free and arrives about a week later. You get step by step tracking. Their return policy is awesome! I tried returning one thing that didn’t fit well and I was refunded that exact second. I recommend you give Temu a try! You may find you love it too!",Absolutely impressed
1,2023-09-22 14:49:38,"This app is awful in every measurable way. Too good to be true is spot on. Customer support is a joke and the company they outsource local shipping with (OnTrac) is the least trustworthy company on the market. Drivers will just keep your package and say it’s been delivered. Nobody either with temu or OnTrac is ever held accountable. I have been digging around and I only see fake five star reviews and real ones (all one star) claiming they’ve either had their cc info stolen and never received their items or they have simply never received the items. Credible sources also suggest this company is using illegal child labor to produce goods. I find this hard to believe only due to the fact that nobody has been receiving their packages. If you want an honest review, go to temu’s reviews on the BBB (better business bureau) and you’ll see their true colors. This company is more than likely using illegal practices and should be shut down immediately. It’s a shame that the Apple Store is allowing this garbage app on their platform. I only pray that it’s removed before more innocent people are scammed like myself and everyone else.",Never received anything. Straight up scam
1,2023-05-24 22:17:49,"With misspelling being a common occurrence not only on the product items but also notifications and pop-ups themselves it’s hard to not sit and laugh when you go on any social media and see how hard TEMU tries to get people to spend money on the app. I refuse to buy anything on here cause it’s so sketchy looking. Hear mostly bad and some good about this app and the only good comes from people who were given compensation for hyping up the app. They also have a hard time doing math somehow. I wanted to get something and had a 40% coupon and a $30 cart. When I was looking at the checkout stuff it said the max amount you could save was $4? That or annoy all your friends and loved ones so maybe you’ll get $9 max with 90% off? Also had a family member try and take advantage of a deal and told they’re deal maxed out and a single digit amount. They also bought stuff and it looks like they just take whatever the package is and just shrink-wrap it around that item, have boxes bent up cause it’s not packaged right and somehow they’re more environmentally friendly even thought they use tons of plastic and other stuff?",Sketchy as ****
3,2023-05-19 00:55:24,"Although Temu is relatively cheap, also the quality of products are extremely cheap and poor. So far I had 3 missing items in my orders, but Temu has been good refunding me.  The time to receive the orders is too long, they should process stuff faster and give real and updated tracking information. Some packages will show the same tracking info for days, and then out of the blue is right your door. So no true tracking is provided. Sometimes is FedEx and sometimes other provider.  I waited over 1 hr and 45 mins online to actually chat with one of the customer service reps, since they do not provide any phone help. So I think Temu needs to have a phone number were as a customer will be able to call and get issues resolve.  Overall in my opinion Temu is to buy things that are not that important to you, since Temu stuff is poor quality. But if you really want something to last, for the long run, pay a little extra and get better quality somewhere else.",Not 100% satisfied
5,2023-03-18 13:24:12,"If you are thinking about ordering from Temu, but are concerned about we’re they are located, or trustworthy I’m here to tell you that I had the same concerns, but I took a chance and I am so glad I did. It took a little more time to receive my order but they kept me well informed as to when to expect it. What can I say about Temu, besides the fact that I love everything I received from my order, Great , Great pricing, ( with pricing through the roof these days, there prices are affordable) . They are in my opinion trustworthy, friendly, and sell very well made products.  I love everything about this company, and to date have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered. So it’s your choice, but I’m so glad I made the choice to take a chance. I’ve ordered from them three times so far and will continue to be a customer as long as they continue to be in my opinion a great company.",Don’t hesitate
5,2023-08-04 20:38:34,"I was expecting another Wish / Aliexpress kind of app, but I’m shocked at the quality! Of corse, the quality isn’t anything incredible, but for the price you are paying it’s totally worth it! Some items are even as good of quality of items you can buy in store for 2 times the price!! Shipping usually takes 10-13 days which is MUCH FASTER than most Asian websites and apps.  I’ve now ordered about 7 packages from Temu and I’ve never had a single issue with any of them! Literally haven’t ordered from Aliexpress since I’ve downloaded Temu, I 100% prefer this app to any others that are similar.  I’ve ordered items such as makeup, purses, clothing, shoes, jewelry and toys and each one has been a 5/5 stars! I haven’t had to return anything I have purchased yet :) Temu even gave me a $5 credit because one of my packages came a few days late, outstanding customer service!!",Genuinely Impressed!!
5,2023-06-06 22:09:10,"At first, when I saw the app I was very suspicious of the low prices. As I was scrolling through the products I saw that you could get 5 pairs of socks for a really low price of $2! I decided to buy a few things since if it came a scam, I still didn’t have to pay for shipping, and the products were really cheap. I decided to get the clear straws and smoothie cups. The order came in at a surprisingly fast rate of around a week. This was a surprise because normally products from China and around China take normally 3-4 weeks to arrive. The smoothie cups I got were exactly fit to the description as well as the straws. I have ordered many more things and do not regret it at all. Around 5 days ago I ordered SIX things for an amazing price of $10! I would definitely recommend for birthday gifts and to treat yourself to some cheap things!! Definitely an amazing find, 5 stars!",This app is not a scam!
5,2023-02-02 19:59:22,"I have been purchasing from Temu since the beginning of November 2022. I was skeptical at first, but all of their claims has been fulfilled. An order was two days late and I received a five dollar credit!   A pair of shoes I liked was not available in my size, so I submitted a request for my size and within a week it was available and I was notified via email.   Every day I go on, and there are new categories of items. It seems like anything I can think of is either already on Temu or will soon appear! Their customer service is amazing. I have not been compensated for this testimonial by any means. I am just an average American, who is amazed by the level of quality retail management. Although I do have one huge complaint. I find something I need and/or can’t live without every time I log onto Temu, LOL.  I am not typically a shopaholic, I do not buy like this from any other website.",TEMU is truly amazing!
3,2023-02-16 12:03:37,"I didn’t have that high of expectations for this app but it wasn’t honestly that bad but like one user I saw said, my phone was glitching a lot too. And this had never happened until I download this app. The deals they have on there and the games you could play to get prizes are really great but i feel like a lot of them are rigged. I was trying to get something for my older sister for her birthday and it was that 3 prize game and I picked the last prize which was the prize I was giving to my sister so I got really happy but my phone looked like it glitched for a second then it showed that I didn’t get it which I know I did. And the Fish land game I had 90% is what I was at and I leave the app for not even 5 minutes and I’m down to 50%. The things you can get on the app are really great I just don’t think I’m gonna download it again. It’s more like a marketing strategy making you invite more people cause you want a prize while it’s probably just bringing your money or percentage whatever it is down.",temu
5,2023-02-24 18:38:36,"I am loving Temu so much so far! I found Temu online when I was looking for cheap Lego dupes and ended up buying so much more😭 Temu has prices that you rlly can’t ignore and they have so many items that I haven’t seen in other websites before it’s so cool!! The products are really good quality! And shipping doesn’t take long at all! Their return/refund options are also so amazing! I had an item that i loved but was too big n so I wanted to return and order again in a smaller size, however they ended up fully refunding me & I didn’t have to return the item at all, I was ecstatic!😭 so far, Temu is the love of my life for online shopping and have recommended it to so many people I know get it!

Don’t change things that are gonna make your app go from good to bad pls!!😩🥲",I freaking love Temu!!!😩💕
4,2023-10-01 12:03:05,"Im liking what i see so far but the credits ad free gifts nonsense is driving me crazy, they lure you in and then it seems like everythings awesome but then aww your like 2 points away from the prize then you have to refer someone. So i do that and jackpot wow high hopes n all someone signs up and    Yup one darn point.  Then something else pops up. Hey your only one point away spin this and that and you will get the missing point. Three hours later progress is 99.5% from getting the last point, but again you have to send a referral and have somebody sign up😫 i only know a very few people and just by chance one happened to sign up now i gotta find another🤨  Sorry im rambling on.  Stick to just shopping and dont get caught up in the circle ads of promises and letdowns and youll be great. All in all    because of high hopes being flushed and a few hours wasted i gotta go a 4  star. Should be 3 mabey but my fault for falling for empty dreams",Temu credits and free gifts
4,2023-06-02 00:40:54,"So the whole free items stuff is legit! Like it’s real. But it’s harder than you think. I mean if you have a lot of friends and they’ll take maybe 5 minutes of there time for you then it should be no problem. You need to invite a certain amount of people depending on the items price. Then if you cut down that money then you get the item for free. But you need to invite people MOSTLY NEW! I got things but you know only once. And you get multiple items per order. ( 3 total ) Now to the iffy part. So if I want to order stuff like with irl money. You have to have an order over $10 which I get, it’s easy for the company but come on. I want to get a $5 item for my dog and I can’t without spending another $5 for it… you can gain points coupons very easy, but you know I want to be able to purchase a $3 order. But the good thing is most the time you get free shipping. Mostly good quality and you know, a good legit app. I suggest!",LEGIT! but……😕
5,2023-07-20 02:54:39,"After researching the background of the Temu app and the company, and learning all I could first,  I thought I’d give it a small test and place an order of various items.  Well, several months and many orders later I find this app (and all the rare items you can find in it) to be phenomenal.  I can get the kinds of things I used to count on the now long-gone Radio Shack stores for.  And the prices are unbelievably low.  Out of numerous orders with a huge array of products I’ve only had one occasion to return one item, and they made that experience super easy and hassle free.  I’m continuing to sing the praises of Temu to everybody.  And constantly finding things you won’t find anywhere else (or if they have it, other’s prices are exponentially more).  Especially small electronics and project-related items.  You will love this app.",Rare Finds At Prices That Seem Impossible
1,2023-01-16 23:50:23,Like you see in the title this app is very very hard to use every two seconds I have to invite people to get one free item it takes like two hours to finally be able to get the free item it throws ads in my face saying how other people got free stuff when I don’t care about other people I just want my free stuff but I can not get the free stuff because I have to wait two days to get rid of this coupon that’s trying to give me no delivery time when I did not ask for it and then to get no delivery time I have to pay a extra 40$ to get it although I didn’t do it I don’t appreciate that in order for the coupon to go away I have to ether pay the 40 or 30$ or I have to wait a day for the free stuff deal to end in order to get rid of the coupon and I closed out of the coupon because it’s a new user deal so basically I’m being forced to pay 30 to 40$ just for   A deal I don’t want and it makes me mad because then I have to get rid of the free stuff deal just so I can get rid of the coupon and I have to invite people to much way to much and most of the time people thinks it’s a scam to use,Very hard to use
1,2023-09-05 15:40:08,"Yeah, they have good prices not bad and they offer free shipping. That’s where they get you. Theymust find the cheapest none reliable company. Call Piggy Ship. They are employees must not know how to read because my package never make it to me. They do send a picture of where your package is. Dropped off first two times. I was able to locate packages 5 miles away five whole miles away wasn’t even close to what the street name was. The only thing similar on the address was the four in beginning of my address. Luckily one of the addresses I left a note in your mailbox asking if they got my package and two weeks later I got contacted by the owner of the house so they had it. They opened it up but whatever I wish I got it back. Funny thing is they re-ship me what was sent out to happen again with you even more expensive package and now they clean since the driver it was delivered to the correct address, they’re taking their word for it they even have a picture of the house which is clearly not my house.

2,2023-07-20 17:59:06,"Some of temu’s items have some quality in them but not too sure where it’s coming from or who made it exactly. My mother got a lot of spam calls after giving Temu her information but the delivery for me creeped me out. I was outside on porch with my daughter when a random SUV pulled up, a lady hopped out to give me the bright orange package which I then signed for. She got back in her truck and sat there for a minute. She then returned to my porch and asked via google translator if she could take a picture with me as she’s a tourist from Ecuador. I immediately said no because I don’t want pictures taken of my daughter and I. She said thank you and a few min later took off. My mind wonders what the picture would be used for now a days. I felt very uncomfortable to know she has my name and address now. The safety of my family is priority which is why I won’t order anything from this app here on out.  Aside from that, some of the things I ordered were low quality except for a few items. Please be careful out there, you really can never be too safe.",Odd delivery
4,2023-10-19 16:17:38,"The one thing I find irritating is that I run into great ads every time I’m on the web somewhere and When I click on the item, NO MATTER WHAT I DO, you cannot be delivered TO THAT ITEM on YOUR page. YOU ARE LOSING MONEY. MY MONEY. Why bother to spend $ for advertising of the link does not take people to the item that caused them to click in the first place? I just walk away. Every time. Because whose got time to try to figure out where in your entire collection that one specific item is located? I mean, my time is valuable ya know? This is not to say that I don’t like your app. I love it, but you guys have a problem with your online ads delivering results. Thanks for listening. Love TEMU and recommend it all the time.

3,2022-12-21 02:28:58,"The app is great, but there should be some fixer uppers done to it. Why do we have to click the back button 100 times just to get back to the search button. There should be a place where you can click home, or to your purchases/cart or anywhere else that’s a necessity. Also why don’t they have a “like” button! Like that’s the most important thing, when you’re going through the app from one item to the next, and instead of throwing everything into the cart you can add it to your liked page. That way you can get back to it without messing with the stuff in your cart. And have it there in case you won’t be able to purchase it right away, so it doesn’t get lost in all the back button pressing you have to do! But what would be EVEN BETTER just make a section where people can make lists. Like I’d make a section for the living room another for the kids, and one specifically for me. And then everything will be more organized👍🏼",I like this app.. BUT…
1,2022-12-18 05:13:54,I was so happy to receive the $200 and waited so long for me to redeem it and i didn't even get it because someone beat me to it you know how mad that made me I felt like crying so bad. i feel like they should at least do the top ten people so some of us I have a chance. It look so much time and patience for me to finally add up all those tokens just for me not to win. I waited till the very last second and it is so unfair how I couldn’t even get it. It is literally so late at night and I stayed up just to redeem the $200 and I couldn’t even get them😞😞At first I liked the app a lot because I like how it gives free items but now it’s just getting me mad how it takes so long to get one free item like for the 50 credit I would get 30 or 20 or 25 tickets from most people but now that K only need the 50 credit its just giving me one ticket per person and it really makes me want to cry. Like can we get at least 10-20 tickets per person please. It breaks my hurt when I don't win because im broke and I don't have money to buy nothing so please help a girl out. Especially on the $200.,The games are so difficult to win
4,2023-09-02 16:36:45,Temu is a great app everything is cheap and we get free stuff but there is something l think should be added so l share to my friends and then it says my friend needs to accept well that's okay but l wait for them to accept and they kinda take to long but it's obvious not your fault but l think when you leave the app you should save any changes on what progress they had because my phone sometimes turns off and l do something so I'm not bored and wait for my friend to accept and then l turn my phone on and all my progress is gone like l chose the 4 free stuff and needed 2 or 1 friend to accept and then my phone tuned off for a while because l was distracted by tried to look at my phone to make sure it doesn't turn off and when l turn in back on and go to the app all my progress of getting the free stuff is gone so l think there should be a save button to not lose all your progress.   Thank you for reading this♡,Kiyu's review
5,2023-06-11 00:32:03,"I definitely recommend this app to ANYONE, all you need to sign up is a google account, or a Facebook account, etc. When you first open the app TONS of free items are shoved in your face, and they are real, most items that are cheap are “ripoffs” but there are still SO many things that are high quality and real, I have so much fun looking through the deals and choosing the free items I want, some free items are surprisingly high quality, like the 168 pack alcohol markers I got for free, there are also fun games to play that add free items to the fun, again, I definitely recommend this to anyone, you may have seen a lot of temu ads on TikTok, which are fake, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t download the app, it is still very worth it, again, I recommend this to anyone looking for good deals, and thank you temu for all the free stuff","Best shopping app out there, but one problem"
5,2023-06-01 06:35:04,The prizes and money games on the back side of this app is literally a pyramid scheme they literally make it impossible to actually win anything and the prompts for getting a prize lie! For example i will be 2 dollars away from winning a supposed 150$ which would be 50$ in PayPal cash and 100$ in a store coupon I will be short 10 coins from being able to spin and a prompt will pop up saying send an invite and win 10 coins for your next spin well I’ll send the invite but won’t get coins and my invite will be for someone who doesn’t have the app but alas I don’t get the coins. Well what they don’t ADVERTISE is that they need that new user to join the app and game. And even if they do actually join they will not give the full 10 coins they will only give 5.  So your still short 5 coins to spin yet it just said send an invite and receive 10 coins,Pyramid scheme

1,2023-05-15 23:24:23,"Firstly, I must emphasize the extremely poor quality of customer service I received when attempting to resolve an issue with a recent purchase. Despite several attempts to reach out through various channels, including phone calls and emails, I was met with lengthy response times, unhelpful automated messages, and a general lack of empathy from your support representatives. This level of service is far below the standards I have come to expect from your esteemed organization and has left me feeling frustrated and unheard.  Additionally, I must express my disappointment with the Temu giveaway program. After participating in good faith, I have come to realize that it is nothing but a scam. The promises made were enticing, but the actual experience fell drastically short. The lack of transparency, misleading information, and an overall sense of deception have left me questioning the integrity of your company.  The website pages are not properly designed and loaded and when a customer clicks on a certain page it doesn’t lead them to that exact page. Thank you and that is all.","Terrible Service, Giveaway scams and more."
1,2023-05-06 01:18:48,Absolutely fraud and don’t even think of falling into their trap at all. It’s such a bunch of fraudsters who either sell defective non functional products or even to make it more worse they even don’t have any customer service. Also these days to “cut the cost” they have eliminated customer service person and started a method where you are compelled to CREATE A TICKET and then after few follow ups the ticket gets closed without any sort of resolution with some predrafted messages. In short it’s such a total fraud platform where you’ll surely be running into troubles and hassles and Ofcourse your hard earned money is at a stake. Be aware buyers don’t fall in trap of any flaw looking discounts or spinning wheels or any other foolish concepts they have on their marketplace. It’s all basically a trap to get your money in lieu of their crappy defective stuffs and to make it worse they even won’t sent them/meaning you even won’t receive it. If you read all the complaints here most of them are for non receipt of goods. So stay away and never even think of visiting or buying anything from here.,Absolutely Fraud Shopping Marketplace
5,2022-11-30 14:46:58,"The app is amazing, I went through and read the bad reviews.. and it seems those people are simply Karens and Kevin’s. I have invited hundreds of people and have received every incentive promised by the app. I have gotten over $1600 in free stuff! I have returned items (which is SUCH an EASY process) I have ordered over 400 products, and everything has came within a week time frame, and all of great quality! Outstanding compared to Aliexpress/SHEIN!.. some items take a bit longer but that’s normal with us coming up on a MAJOR HOLIDAY! People seem to forget that!   Customer service is amazing! I have spoken to several different Agents and they have assisted me wonderfully - sometimes they do take a moment to respond, but with the app being #1 in shopping charts.. I expected this to happen!   The review section isn’t bad.. sometimes it’s hard to find the exact review you’re looking for - but it’s because they provide ALL reviews from that particular seller.. (sometimes we as customers have to do homework, and scroll a bit more for the review we want - isn’t rocket science people)  If I could give the app more than 5 stars, I would.   Inflation is HOT and this app has seriously covered my entire Christmas Shopping! Will continue to refer friends to download it, and use it.. and I’ll continue to purchase!",Ignore The 1-2 Star Reviews Given!
5,2023-07-23 17:00:16,Alright I’m not one of those people trying to get the 150 or whatever but Temu in my opinion is amazing! My sister and mom on the other hand have gotten terrible things. Take my advice before purchasing GO THROUGH REVIEWS this will help you 100%. The items on this app is a hit or miss. Their customer service is good to me but wasn’t to my mom and I don’t know why. I have taken things back and it’s not a big deal and I’ve gotten money back. Some very insignificant items they will let u keep free to donate but you get your money back for the refund. I personally love this app it’s cheap and worth the price you pay. Just please be cautious before your decide that’s the item you want. Also make reviews so that you can help others out! I have gotten bad items and review it so people know not to waste their time because it is very helpful to others. Have fun shopping!,Great but
1,2023-09-24 10:52:34,"I have been a customer of Temu for a couple months now. For the most part I am happy with my purchases, I can note that the majority of clothing is made from the same polyester “blend” The prices can’t be beat and if not satisfied you can return for free! I recently started “playing” this silly game to earn a reward but it’s all a hoax to get you to bring more customers to them or make more purchases….. mind you I’ve been ordering at least once or twice a week from them! Do yourself a favor and don’t get sucked in thinking your going to earn a credit or reward since it’s a total waste of precious time!! Makes me reconsider if I want to continue shopping here 😡 Also just wanted to add that the silly fish you are feeding in the stupid game seem easy to collect ( in the beginning ) once you get into single digits needed for the reward these fish take 2-3 days of feeding to collect!! It’s rather funny that the developers think people are this stupid! I even have screenshots of the % that BARELY MOVES when you feed one of these fish!  Seriously BE HONEST TEMU!! This really makes me want to shop elsewhere",Be careful
5,2023-06-15 23:26:51,"Absolutely no complaints! I’ve placed 24 orders so far and every transaction has gone smoothly. My husband downloaded the app and is hooked now too!  It’s kinda like an online dollar store. Just be mindful of your purchases. Meaning - read descriptions thoroughly, read feedbacks thoroughly, especially PAY ATTENTION TO MEASUREMENTS! Can’t emphasize that one enough! Examples - my husband is an XL on American sizes but on Temu he needs to order XXL or XXXL. Also, most of their photos are enlarged so don’t judge something by the image but the measurements. If a listing doesn’t specify “glass or plastic” then it’s most likely plastic.  When I’ve had a few items that weren’t exactly what I wanted or didn’t fit etc., Temu resolved my concerns promptly!  Overall, it’s a fun app to shop with without breaking the bank. Especially if you’re into crafting, have small children or a really cheap husband 😉",Shopping like a socialite!
5,2023-03-11 16:55:24,So for the free gifts thing temu only lets us accept on invitation per day and what if other people want me to accept theirs too like at least do 5 people per day. lAnd don’t get me started on the games if you play it it will be easy in the beginning but like once your close to getting the gift it will be hard for example the fish game it got me to three fish so easily and I needed four fish but once it was at 95% of getting the fish 10 fish food will only get you 0.01 and then it got so annoying bc it was my last day too soo just gave up and just started buying but no when I wanted to order it couldn’t accept it bc I had a visa gift card and it kept on saying try again later or the payment couldn process or something like that but I heard good things about and i got one free gift which was enough for me pls temu just add more updates and then maybe I rate it a 5,Rigged

I just wish they add a fav and save later button instead of putting everything in the cart. Although you can unselect items, once you have hundreds of items in your cart it is just a mess trying to go through all of it.   Love how many different sellers they have available. So many items to choose from it is overwhelming at times for me.  There is Always a sale going on, it’s definitely addictive, so pace yourself! Love that they also allow pay in four because i don’t always want to pay all of it up front. I’ve had great experiences with 99% of my purchase. And if there was an issue they didn’t hesitate to offer refund. Shipping is usually a week or two. Only once it was delayed and they gave me credits for my next purchases. I plan to buy plenty more especially if the price and quality stays good.",Prices unbeatable!
5,2023-02-22 16:34:18,I hesitated months before ordering from this site because there’s so many scammers out there and I’m very skeptical about many things and people when it comes to money and cc payments. So as with so many other sites I checked into it with the better business bureau and found it to be a legitimate site with so many high ratings so after months of hesitation I decided to give it a try…well let’s just say after receiving my first order I couldn’t wait to share your website and show off my beautiful purse and other items with my family & friends at our Super Bowl night gathering. They are already ordering. They know I do my research before sharing information. My sister has many items coming..just hoping to get them before her husband sees them.

5,2023-10-18 22:12:04,I am secretly running away from my apartment due to a bad relationship I got myself in. I am leaving most of everything behind to my ex. I needed new of everything but I am super low on money. I hate waiting for months for things to ship and I heard that this app doesn’t take as long to ship. I downloaded it and I got myself everything I need under $200. 😭😭😭😭😭it said it will ship everything to my work just before I move in - in a week. It snapped me out of depression and got me excited about my new place that i am moving into and all the cute things that are arriving soon put a smile on my face. I feel good and excited again. I am 28 (still young) so I want to focus on designing my place how I want and it’s become a hobby now instead of focusing on my past.

Just make sure you send a picture or a video and no problem. I have not had a problem yet with customer service.

2,2023-09-10 05:06:12,This app is not fake I did get all my stuff for free BUT when I tried to get free stuff the second time around I had to do it by dollars and for one person it only gave me 0.01 CENT. Keep in mind I had to make $10 total to get all my free products but with getting only 1-10 cents each person that was impossible to achieve. For one thing I ordered it looked completely different from the pictures. It wasn’t even the same color and it didn’t even have the same gems it said it would. I also tried to order press on nails but it kept taking it out of my cart. When I tried the first time it said I would get 5 items free and pat $5-$10 for the rest but it wanted me to pay for almost all products. It said I would only be getting 3 free items and I had to pay for the rest. This app is a scam but not fake. I still got my free products but 2 out of the 3 were damaged and different from pictures shown on the app. I would say it is a scam but I can’t say it’s fake. Please fix this and don’t let this app take your money.,Good and bad
5,2023-05-29 13:56:21,"I admit my expectations were low. You usually get what you pay for.  But I was really surprised at the quality of most of the items.  I bought two tshirts. The material was fantastic but didn’t really fit. I wear 3x and ordered 5x as suggested.  I could put them on but they were to tight for me. The material and workmanship were great and I was disappointed I couldn’t wear them.  Then I bought $190 worth of little gadgets, fun things, things to use at school etc.  I had coupons for $140 so I paid $59  and it was fun and enjoyable going thru the box. Out of all of it there was only one thing that didn’t work that was a suction cup thing to take dents out of your car.  I also bought one of the rompers. I loved it again size 5.  It fit but in me was tight in the wrong places. I gave it to my niece who wears 1x-2x and it looked great on her but a little long. So have fun.",Shopping was fun and easy
5,2023-03-24 04:59:09,I got an item while it was fully in stock and after a week I was told I couldn’t get it because it was out of stock?? I’d already placed my order and waited a week for it to not even be fully packed when I was under the impression it’d be arriving around this time. They gave me a free $5 of store cash but I just want my package. I understand that issues come up but I’m just wondering why I already confirmed I was getting an item and now I’m being told it’s out of stock after a week? I got refunded the amount I paid for the item itself but I’m wondering why it didn’t say “out of stock” before I ordered it. If someone has an explanation I’d be happy to listen but at the moment I’m severely disappointed and upset. I was really looking forward to that specific item and it’s the whole reason I ordered in the first place.,Item out of stock after I placed my order a week ago?
2,2023-05-23 05:45:39,"New to Temu placed my first order. Half my order came in but the other half sent to wrong address with usps stating it’s labeled wrong.  Contacted customer service about the issue in which they kept stating that’s it’s shipped and that i will be given credit if it’s late. Didn’t care bout the credit just wanted to know that if the package is labeled wrong, am I even going to get the package or not?  After I stated never mind I was going to write a review on this then it asked if I want to speak to someone.  Kind of late already and when the agent entered the chat I stated I didn’t need help anymore they stated, “I seen your concerns and we will work on it have a great day, thanks for the positive feedback”.  What made me write this was the inefficiency of the customer service to acknowledge the problem or even direct me to someone to speak to about the problem, and also my concern of whether or not the package will be in or not 🤦🏽‍♂️.  Both of which irritated me enough to write this review.",Half of order sent to wrong address/ customer service was no help🤦🏽‍♂️
1,2023-09-17 06:23:48,"I used to like the app and bought things from it. Now. Decided never to use it again cause it’s fraud. Trying to get people to use this app by showing free gifts. But end up asking you to invite people over and over again. Only $2 dollars to go you thought you can get it easily by inviting only 2 or 4 people. But it breaks the $2 into $1 and $1, then break the $1 into $0.5 and $0.5. Then into $0.2, $0.3. Then $0.1 and $0.1, you thought it’s finally done, only $0.1 to go. Maybe invite another friend will help you reach the free gifts. But no! It breaks again into $0.05. I guess even you invite another friend, you only get $0.03, still $0.02. They are gonna break it into $0.01 and $0.01. Then $0.005? It’s actually never will be any free items. Bc there will be lots of 0s after the “.” Trust me. Don’t believe Temu. I heard they already owe the venders a lot of money and won’t pay them back. And the reason they trying to get you invite more people is to steal their information. Or even hack your phone.

5,2023-08-04 15:06:21,"Let me tell you something right now. All the little games they have? The real way you get free stuff is by referring people, ignore all the flashy animations engineered to make you feel like youre winning at a lottery or something. The only way temu will give you free stuff is referring someone, and temu WANTS PROOF thats this person you referring is using the app. That’s the only way. Its marketing at the end of the day, if you came to this app for the free stuff, you will leave disappointed. This aspect seems more appropriate to influencers n such so they can give decent stuff to fuel their brand.   Now on to shopping. They legit have good deals on homeware, kitchen stuff, and storage.

The best have been the clothing items although the fabric has not always been good- particularly for the man’s shirt.  Also had to return one woman’s top as fabric was unsatisfactory although print colors were good.  The very  inexpensive items are the worst for value and quality.  It is not worth returning them- so I am absorbing one or two that totally did not work as loss leaders for the many others that were satisfactory or better in quality.    All in all, Temu provides good products for far less than the equivalent in the domestic market.  The free shipping policy is also a plus as are the incentives for buying more from them.

I was very surprised and I have been using them ever cents. I love the fact that there’s no shipping fee usually and they do have such a variety of items they have anything and everything you could possibly want now.

3,2023-04-15 14:41:48,"To start most people don't realize that these items have to pass through customs.  That's where shipping gets delayed and becomes a waiting game.  This part is not actually Temu's fault.   Customs does things on their own schedule.   If you buy clothing, buy a size up.  The clothing runs small.  Same with the shoes and the shoes all seem to be narrow fit.  HAND WASH all the clothing you buy and do NOT put it in a dryer even on the delicate cycle.  One trip in the washer and dryer and the thread that holds the clothes together falls out. Happily I can sew. But still the clothing doesn't last long even if you hand wash it.  Expect to only wear the clothing you buy from here a couple of times unless you want to re-sew everything.  The household items are the same quality of what you buy in a dollar store.  But I'm not sure why anyone would expect anything different with the prices these items are.   I will order little things here and there but not clothes or shoes again.","Shipping, clothing and shoes"

How ever I don’t like how there are so many games and so many ways to win free gifts and things and yet they are all so impossible to win. I’ve spent months on the app. And I’ve learned each games time always seems to run out right when you’re about to win the free prizes. Maybe I just have bad luck. I’m not sure but it seems to never fail when I’m a few percentages away from growing the adult fish or a few bucks from the free gift or a few coins away from getting the last prize from the 3 hat trick game my time runs out and I have to start the game over. You’d think after purchasing so many items the games would become easier to win to keep costumers attention. Getting the free items would help boost sales.

For example the type of material the metal is and if it’s silver plated or chrome plated. Even the coins. Are these real or mass produced and made from what? I know you get what you pay for. Plus the fact something can not be vintage when it’s newly made. Thanks though.

I decided to spend about $25 on the app. The shipping was 10 Days. The only problem were, when my items finally arrived around 8pm at night. I was sure my package was about to get delayed but nope. I loved everything that I received. I made a video on me opening everything as well. One product was fine but the box was damaged .

The only thing that saddens me is that not everything is as expected or the fitting sometimes even though it says true fit it doesn’t always mean that I don’t like to return anything but unfortunately I have. I think if the website would have a description of what type material it’s made of. It would be easier for me in what not to pick and if you do, I can’t figure it out but if we can see it under the picture that you can click on it or something and it tells you what exactly the material is made of it would be a lot easier for me and I am sure for a lot of other people to make a decision and possibly not have to return anything because that is my goal to not have to return anything but unfortunately I have had to.

As an example I bought a Beauty and the Beast, Belle, dress for approximately $16 on Temu and what appeared to be the exact same style dress at Disneyland for $120.  The material and craftsmanship appeared the same also.  Generally speaking most of my purchases are dresses for 4-10yo girls and every item is well made, nice fabric, good fitting and exactly as shown on the app. Delivery is about 7-10 days and shipping has always been free.

Returns are easy though you'll have to purchase your own box or bag to ship it back in. Clothes can feel a little bit cheap but a lot of them also feel high quality, just read reviews before buying. They're definitely great if you're on a budget. Electronics have been a miss for me. I ordered an electronic skin scrubber and an electronic shaver and they had sent me disgusting, used items. Haven't tried again since then because you have to get everything electronic or battery powered delivered in a separate package than your regular items. Also got a sunset lamp that turned out to be a bust since the remote didn't work and there was no other way to change modes.

They have been exactly as advertised. And the prices are absolutely incredible. I had a problem with only one item, and it was taken care of immediately and very satisfactorily. The only thing I would say, is as far as clothing goes, always check the size guide to find out what size you should order. All the clothing does not run the same size. 1X on one shirt may not be the same size as a 1X in another shirt. But as long as you check the size guide you should not have any problem.

There are many different ways to pay with Temu so that is it is safe for you to use your card, I have found the most interesting things on this website at a very cheap price shipping for me usually takes about a week to a week and a half and it does come from overseas so you have to expect that it’s going to take longer for you to receive it other than that I have enjoyed my shopping experience on Temu and expect to continue shopping",Favorite

From the impeccable quality to the lightning-fast delivery, every aspect has exceeded my expectations.  One of the standout features has been the unparalleled customer service. The team’s kindness and responsiveness have truly set a new standard. On the rare occasions when I’ve made purchases that turned out to be too large, TEMU’s prompt refund process has been a welcome surprise. What’s even more impressive is that sometimes, there’s no need for a return, showcasing a level of trust and understanding that is truly remarkable.  TEMU, you have created something truly special. Your commitment to excellence is evident in every interaction. Please continue this outstanding work. You’ve won a customer for life.",Exceptional Experience with TEMU
5,2023-10-08 17:42:36,"This site, I Absolutely Love! It is a Very Well Trusted Site!!! unlike some sites out there, that you have to be very careful of. Whenever I buy any products on this site, and I have Bought A lot of,  I Always hit the “ track and updates “ because they are so Accurate and Honest and they ALWAYS keep you updated on where your product is and when it will be delivered. I have not found that on other sites that I have bought on. They will give you a Five Dollar Credit to use for future purchases if your product is late in arriving but all the products that I have purchased has either come on time or have come early!! I also Love this Site because it has such a wide variety of different kinds of products that you can view and purchase and for the fact that the prices are Very Inexpensive!!",Buying Products on Temu
5,2023-06-15 22:14:52,I have been ordering from TEMU for about 9 months now. I have never had any issues with receiving product. At first it took 3 weeks to receive but it seems the more often I order the better the delivery. At first I just ordered the princess dresses for my granddaughter which are fabulous by the way. Excellent quality and true to size fit then did other kid merchandise and then I started on earrings. The quality is fine and I have purchased at least 20 pair. Price is right. Then I though I would try plus size women’s clothing and was pleasantly surprised. As i said the quality is fine. Not cheap product. I have since purchased women’s shoes men’s shirts and various other products. Their silk flowers are fantastic. I have a friend who buys all his outdoor lighting from TEMU and it is great stuff.  It won’t hurt to give TEMU a try. I do feel like a millionaire lol,TEMU as a whole
5,2023-06-14 20:47:12,You’ll save so much as long as you don’t mind waiting a few days for delivery. Company has great reputation. If anything arrives damaged or wrong size Temu will issue a refund & thus far I’ve never had to go thru trouble of being asked to return anything. Temu trust it’s customer. You’ll really save on things like underwear & shoes. You’ll find cool stuff @ great prices you’re familiar with & interesting things you’ve never heard of but can’t live without. I especially love the pet supply section & the charge boxes for cell phones. Anything for a cell phone is much better priced here. Phone cases too. Many of the cases/products are the exact same as what’s on Amazon…except the price is always much better. If they are 1 day late on delivery they’ll issue a $5 credit & do so without asking. I’m cheap & Im always excited to have a package arrive one day late. 5 stars plus!,Amazing
5,2023-05-30 06:26:57,"I have been buying from Temu for the last three months. At first I was skeptic so I one bought one pretty little dress for my great granddaughter . Well it arrived in about 10 days and looked just like the  one advertised . Really pretty and good quality. So then I ordered a larger order of baby clothes,baby rattles and stuffed toys. Everything was good except one outfit. It was cute but I didn't like the fabric . No problem . I-was given a choice to get an instant credit or be refunded to my credit card . I took the credit to use on my next purchase as I already had selected items. The return was easy . Print a label, put it in a mailing bag, attach label and drop at UPS. Since then I have enjoyed  shopping on the Temu site! So much to choose from! I will continue to use them for many different items! Good quality! Good prices! Great customer service!",Wonderful Bargains
1,2022-10-13 22:05:25,Even though customer service is 24/7. Temu takes a long time to respond after getting a hold of someone. I had a problem with Usps shipping my package to the wrong address. I’ve checked the address I’ve had down and checked where it actually got shipped to. It was sent to a totally different state. I messaged Temu and they took forever to respond. Once they acknowledged my problem they told me they cannot do anything about it and said to contact Usps to get the package back and if I don’t get it then contact the sellers for a refund. Usps have delivered it to a persons front porch so there’s no way I’m getting my package. And of  course I had to message the four sellers I bought from. And two out of the four didn’t understand. One of them said I have to talk to logistics and I already did. The other eventually understood and so three out of the four sellers that understood said they will refund but who knows if it’ll actually be refunded. The reason I went to buy from Temu is because an influencer I follow on TikTok raved about it. And the items she had on were cute.,Customer service is not great
1,2023-10-17 18:04:52,"Nice items on temu but with a flaw items maybe not as described. I have had 2 orders either damaged in shipping or just completely different the website like really. First order was 3 items toothbrush set, electric razor, apple accessories 5 in 1. Out of which electric raze came damaged due to poor packaging. Then used my credit since temu was out of items I added to fishland so it gave me options to get credit or select different items. So I did for wireless charger 2 in 1 and the forgot to mention it's not going to work and you will be able to use it since it's usb c and if you don't have wall adapter u wont be able to use it. I got invested from a friend to play fishland and I have already invited 8 friends and family. People said it's good to be true you get free items for reffer people. Now I know what you get and condition and or spammed with different offers. It's like cheap crap for really cheap price or should I say cheap garbage.  P.S: latest update you have to refer 20 people and place $200 order to get a free items and takes 2 months for $25 dollars in items. Not worth it.",Nice but
