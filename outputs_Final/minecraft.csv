4,2023-09-20 19:49:57,"I have played Minecraft for a long time. Ever since this update came (the one where you can now crawl not in Bella) I have saw many things happening. The first one being is when placing/breaking blocks I see some black shadow come up and go out of my screen. Two. I’m not sure if it’s me or the game but when I use a repeating command block and try to put in where to TP too it just won’t work. What I mean by this is even if I put in the position it won’t work. Then last one 3. I’m not sure how to crawl because I’m playing on IPhone and not computer. This is all I have of the problems but in my opinion, I think some new things should be added. The first one is putting back where you can tame ocelots. 2. Maybe make like task you have to do to get free minecoins because I just don’t think you should pay for it and have to pay for the game. 3. Maybe make like a group/website, put in names of peoples user name,spin a wheel and whoever it lands on they give ideas to put in Minecraft. 4. Like I said earlier, I also don’t think it’s right to make people buy the game, pay for minecoins, and now have to make a Microsoft account with it just to be able to join servers and play with friends. And 5. Make different kinds or types of wolves. This is all I have now and I really think everyone should play Minecraft of all age. Thank you for reading this :)",Why I put in a 4 star rating
5,2022-08-03 17:27:37,So first time I went into survival it was hard so I went into creative mode and I Spond frogs since you’re allowed to and a few days later I made a house yeah it was fun in a few days later I realize something that I can get commands so then I got a barrier block it was pretty fun this game is very good for probably 4+ or if you’re older than probably better and then I saw the cutest little thing it was a baby bunny in Minecraft guess what I did I hit it and then I got rabbit Leg which is supposedly very rare but I get rabbit leg a lot so it isn’t really rare just like the title says it’s hard on iPad but once you get used to it it gets so much easier so definitely probably go on a PC it’s probably much easier sorry that this is so long this is probably the best game ever so I recommend you playing this🤩🤩☺️ yes it is that good so definitely play this game it is literally the best I’m trying to figure out how to get mods🧐🧐so yeah sometimes it gets laggy in don’t be alarmed if when you like play a different game on your device and it really sets the world on Minecraft it’s probably just making sure that it isn’t laggy or there isn’t like any hackers or something like that so if you don’t want any random people joining then just go to settings I mean you probably can’t go to settings you have to like press the pencil and then you can press multiplayer and there you go dang this is long bye have a good day,It is a little hard on iPad  i recommend creative
5,2023-07-11 22:25:01,I wanted to play this game because my brother played it all the time and I fell in love with this game after a few days. It is definitely a must play and is really one of my favorite games ever and if there is a top 5 best games this game will make sense if its on there🥰 There is some bugs that I have noticed but not as many as some other games that I played. If you want to be a builder this game is for you but it is also about crafting and fighting that is not that hard and it is really fun if you do creative and not as fun if you do survival but it is still fun! Also has rules for your first time like don’t dig straight down there might be lava under you don’t place a bed in the neither and end dimensions because it will explode and if you have a lot of stuff in survival mode don’t let a monster kill you because your stuff will fall out ( but it won’t fall out when you load your world and put the no falling out stuff when you die mode on.) And extra ones like don’t look into a endermen’s eyes (the endermen are the black monsters with purple eyes) and if you do it will get mad and try to kill you and don’t activate the skull sencers in the caves and if you do ( by making loud noises) the warden will spawn and try to elemenate you and watch out because it does lots of damage. And that was some stuff and tips that you now know about Minecraft and it is worth to play!,should be in the top 5 best games
5,2022-06-03 23:17:24,"I was in the App Store looking for another app till I saw this game,Minecraft. I have heard of it before,some people say it’s a awesome game so,I downloaded it! And just like other poeple said. ITS AWESOME!!!!! Usually I used to have it on easy and not noticing I can change the game mode. I was really scared of the lava,spiders,monsters, and the skeletons I hated them I couldn’t fight them! ☹️🙁 And how I learned I can change the game mode is when a spider fell on my face! 🕷😱😱😱 I can also spawn animals which I like to do that so I can tame animals like wolves and cats also pandas I love when I can feed the pandas it’s adorable if u wanna tame a cat use raw fish 🐟🤢🤢🤢 anyways sorry if this review is to long but if u have read this review u should totally download this!! Bai! :EDIT: This game is awesome like me from 5 years ago said!! ^^ Anyways,just 1 thing…for some reason when I hopped on Minecraft inside the game I was signed out and I couldn’t log in!! So I have no idea if I was hacked or something went wrong with minecraft or my tablet (maybe it was my tablet it was like made 7 years ago-) but I don’t know I’ll see if I can try to fix these..but please send me some information that could possibly help me get my account back!! Anyways my recommendation is……people who like exploring and like roleplaying with made up creatures made up worlds and likes making houses and survival games then….this game is for you!!!",Minecraft Mob 👁👃🏼👁
5,2023-10-08 07:18:41,I used to think that to play this game you needed friends and if you started a world it would force you to play with other people you didn’t know… that is not true! It’s very good game it good if you have friends it a good game if you don’t it’s a good game if you wanna play with people and it’s a good game if you don’t… it’s good for if you like parkour if you like bonding with people over jokes in the mines it’s a good game if you like participating in challenges it’s a good game if you like making a dream perfect house for your pets and yourself (and maybe friends if you’re feeling nice that day) it’s a good game if you like farming it’s a good game if you like telling stories through books and mysteries it’s a good game if you like building towns and family’s that don’t really exist it’s a good game if you like re-creating things in the real world and spending so much time on it (with or without help from other people) then look at it and just feel great that you made that it’s a good game if you like survival games where you can build an honest life (again with or without other people) it also has lovely music that I like listening to even when I’m not playing the game also the animals in the game are very cool and their still adding more to be amazed by! Over all very good game for almost everyone on this earth!  All the best no complaints October 8th 2023 at 12 in the morning            -✨Me✨,10/10
5,2022-08-07 23:05:39,"You must play this game. Why? Well, I have played Minecraft for over 6 years now and it’s great. You can play in creative if you are more of the builder, and doesn’t want mobs creeping up and killing you. But you can also play survival where you try not to die and fight your way to the end to kill the dragon steal the egg, then go home to your beautiful base or moving house to kill the wither to make a beacon. Or you can just have fun explore and play. You can be very creative in this game and creative cool inventions using Redstone. This game is very cool and you should try it out if you don’t like it then I’m sorry. In Minecraft you can install mods or make your own mods to go into the game! You can play with your friends and family and have a fun time! All the while trying not to die if you are in survival. In creative you have all the blocks you need! And there’s different “levels” or like types of how you want your game to be if you are a beginner and think that being on normal mode is to are you can go to easy mode, or if you think that normal it too easy you can go to hard mode! You can make the world to your pleasure and and even play on a server with other people. There is also a market place if you want to share your creativity with other people. But you should really get this game and try it out. Peace out hope you have fun. ✌️","Read me, b/c you must play this game. °v°"
5,2022-06-18 04:02:25,"I love the game, which is why I gave it 5 stars, but there’s this mod I want to talk about. So I already put a one star review on that mod, but I want to say this by review unless I can do it by email. *Inhale* so basically theres a mod in your marketplace that rips you off. (Im not going to say scam because the mod is free but it now takes up my space.) the mod is named Axolotl Islands: Slime Machines made by Tetrascape. I downloaded it because it seemed pretty cool (and also because I adore axolotls, I mean who doesn’t?!), the game wants you to find out how to work it yourself, it doesn’t even tell you what to do in the game or the description!! All you do in the mod is walk around and try to get through portals and look at axolotls in the middle of nowhere. A green arrow is above one of the axolotls, (the yellow and pink one) so I supposed I have to talk to it. There was no button that let me talk to it. The game is basically broken. Since the developer put you in creative mode I looked at the menu to see what items there are not knowing what I was doing, I thought I found something that would open the portals but nothing. The pictures of the game show that there are different islands you can go to, I looked around for an hour trying to find an island. Nothing. Nada. Tetrascape obviously did a terrible job on the mod and now takes up my storage. Thanks a lot.",Basically theres a mod that scams you
5,2020-01-02 20:24:41,"I’ve been playing Minecraft PE since 2011 and it’s awesome! But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let’s say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don’t know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it’s basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star’s second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can’t stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn’t do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do.",Weird custom skin glitch
5,2020-08-03 08:16:47,"Hi. So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It’s ultimately a great game. Here’s some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don’t need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone’s been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That’s all my requests for now. Thank you!",Addicted to this game!
5,2022-07-06 04:36:39,Minecraft PC is already good at this game just amplifies it and this game has some features that are not really NPC obviously most of the PC players after you get the updates faster but like you do when the update came out it’s already coming to my Ted walk I love you it’s a really good game all the updates keep you on your toes and if they’re saying besides the time that they had babies the size double like a Debbies but we can just blame that on my gang that’s all I absolutely love this game this game is probably one of the best to come out probably lost probably 2010 I don’t hold out with all the updates Worth that will be coming also I would like to suggest that the next update should be the end of August and then there would be a new type of armor and then that would be the last armor set in Minecraft also Minecraft does get a little boring at times like when they had bees update and we should probably get another realm even though you guys said that you were never put in another realm we need more roams like maybe like one more also there’s always a layout for one the one in the agency may make the make up you can like the portal when you get to an agency and then in there might be like some really good loot possibly even like nether right armor this is the best game download it now,The best mobile game of all time
5,2021-03-21 18:46:50,"I recall my days as a child in elementary school when this game first gained popularity. All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang. Thank you for changing my life.",A lifelong friend
5,2020-09-04 21:43:18,"Ok, I have been playing Minecraft for years. Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won’t unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the “loading terrain” screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Whenever I want to play a fun game, this will always be my first choice. With the endless building ideas, the challenge of defeating the bosses, and playing countless games and tests Minecraft is the best game out there and will make you play for hours.  A few animal ideas are: Bears, birds, snakes, frogs, mice, sharks, squirrel, elephant, lion, monkey, butterfly, crab, deer, penguin, kangaroo, koala, raccoon, alligator or crocodile and more types of dogs.  Thank you for reading!",Amazing but a few things...
5,2020-01-18 20:43:32,"(Keep in mind, this is the mobile version, PE) It’s such a great game and I love it, but recently it’s been getting more buggy than ever. A few glitches that I have experienced that get very annoying are things such as, when a friend joins, I’ll be wearing their skin, and they’ll be wearing mine (in their POV). It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I’ll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot. Keep in mind, I’ve tried everything. I’ve deleted tons of apps, cleared data from things, just to make sure that I have space on my device (and it’s not that). The most recent glitch for me, however, (which is why I’m writing this) doesn’t even let me into the game. I’ve tried purging all my apps again to clear even more space and I don’t know what else to do. It gets to the last couple of bars in the loading screen and freezes. It doesn’t kick me out, just freezes on that and won’t go into the game. I’m becoming impatient, waiting for it to go into the game and it still won’t. I swipe up the app then go on it again, only for the same result, over and over. No matter how many apps I’ve had before, it’s never done this and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to delete the app for fear of losing all my data and worlds. Anyone have any suggestions??",Great! But it won’t let me even open it.
5,2021-08-06 21:47:22,OK I love Minecraft and I know a really cool update that we should have I heard there was probably gonna be an update for Christmas so I thought it would be a great idea to.... have the update and be like seasonal so for Halloween you would get Halloween decorations and our Halloween stuff and then for Christmas we get Christmas stuff for Valentines you’ll get valentines stuff and everything could be celebrated I think that would be really cool and I can make Minecraft epic like I can’t wait for Christmas those items would be epic and then you could add them as real items to be there forever I think it would make it where everyone’s server would be really cool and more people would want to play and another update we should do is like furniture we could have a bit of furniture like regular furniture nothing too special we just want regular furniture that would be really cool so then everyone would actually be able to make couches and people could sit in their beds instead of having to put my cards in their beds and it’s really hard to do that stuff because it’s just like hard because when it gets messed up or your pets get it you can’t get them out unless you get rid of it and you have to restart your whole bed for couches I don’t know how to sit on them and it will be really boring if you can’t sit on your couch,New updates
5,2021-03-01 02:16:02,"Hi! I just thought of a few new mobs I would like for the developers to add into Minecraft! I hope they at least add in one of them. 1. Skele-Fish. It is a fish that can be found in all water sources in every biome, except for swamps. It can only spawn in when the world is in easy, normal, or hard. It can drop up to 3 bones when killed, it doesn’t attack you unless if you attack it first,  (just like when you hit a wolf in survival when it isn’t tamed to anyone in that world) it deals three hearts when it attacks you, and it has a body made of bones with no eyes. 2. Black Bear. A bear with a brown snout, brown belly, and all the rest is black fur. It can only be found in Taiga (spruce forest) biomes. It has the same body that the polar bear does. It eats raw fish of any type and sweet berries, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them (just like the foxes). They can spawn when the world is in peaceful, easy, normal, or hard. But when it is peaceful, when you attack them they won’t attack you back. But when it isn’t in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival. 3. Penguin. It only spawns in snowy plains and on icebergs. They eat raw fish of any type, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them. They have a white belly and the rest is all-black. They do not attack you when you hit them in easy, normal, or hard.",A few new mobs I would like to be in Minecraft
5,2022-07-02 16:53:36,"Ok I love Minecraft and there are some things that would be better, and or cool but I know this’ll get buried but still. With the wild update there was a “portal” in the ancient city and that’s so cool and I know how long it takes to build things like that because I build things like mansions a lot and it takes days, months, sometimes even years to finish because you may not be motivated enough. But I know there is more than one person on the building team. And I think (like many others) that it would be super cool to add a actual portal into the “ancient dimension” where there is a “warden king” or warden queen depending on the gender or just “warden god.” There would be trees and things like that and it would just look so nice and cute. The trees would be called (in my mind) wisteria trees and they would have purple, blue, yellow, and pink leaves. They would have those same colours as their leaves or just types of blue considering the wardens colours. There would also be ores but I don’t know what to call them. But the other thing is end ores too I don’t know what they would be called. I think it would be cool make them the same durability as netherite or more durability than netherite. That’s all for now I think this new update is so cool but it needs something more. Just thoughts to be honest nothing bad, just suggestions.",Love the game but…
5,2021-01-20 14:55:58,"Minecraft is one of my all-time favorite games to play! I love seeing all of the different updates that are added. Recently, I went at least 2 months without playing which really sucked (STAY IN SCHOOL KIDS) but when I did return to my Minecraft world, there was so much new stuff waiting for me to explore! I think survival is a fun mode if you’re up for a challenge. Then there are people like me. I start with creative and build everything I want (sometimes I get lucky and find a village) and stock up on everything. I mean EVERYTHING. From food to blocks to animals to weapons, I never want to be caught by a monster in survival without the proper weapon! The villagers are really fun to trade with. When I play Minecraft, I listen to the sound on my airpods and I love the noise that villagers make! I recently made a new world titled “Covid is killing my brain cells” where I used everything from the inventory. I have my own little zoo and a very enforced prison where I keep the monsters. Ok I didn’t use EVERYTHING. I didn’t use endermans because (1) they scare the heck out of me and (2) they could just teleport out of their prison cell and murder me ruthlessly in my sleep. I have an aquarium too with all the sea animals. Whoever thought to add dolphins is my new best friend! So what I’m trying to say is that I absolutely love Minecraft and would recommend it to everyone! ❤️",I love love love Minecraft!
5,2020-12-18 03:33:29,This is my fav game In my opinion there is not any other game that is better but I want to put a big thing I want as an update pls!! I love baby villagers I want the creater of minecraft to put a thing in the settings button that says something like any villager you want can turn into a baby forever. And that if you feed the baby’s potato’s they will be your kid so you can play roleplay where they act like real life babys like when they want something to get or some milk to drink they will cry and things but there should be a button on that in settings so you can turn it on and off or that if you click on the villagers you can pick things like this villager play as I baby in roleplay or I follows you and a button that says learn on him where you teach them to talk and walk and crawl. I am sorry that this is sooooo long but I want to be able to love baby villagers and keep them as babys and be there mom. I would also like if you could like if you eat something that you can find in villages and in timpels that if you eat it you have a big belly and one night you have a baby villager and you have to be it’s mom. But only add it for there is a button where you can switch it on and off. Sorry this is long pls respond back pls pls pls I really recommend getting this app it is the best EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER and a thousand more EVERS!lol!!😂sorry it is long bye get the app,Suggestions
5,2019-09-16 01:18:31,"I love Minecraft! I’ve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it’s come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It’s stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It’s a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn’t let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the “how to”, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won’t be able to stop playing! Trust me, you won’t regret getting it!!!💕💕",Minecraft is an amazing game!!💕💕
5,2021-07-21 00:55:10,"I started playing this when I was like eight on my iPad and I LOVED it. I would be playing almost all day and build the most complex things! I still love it today and play it on a regular basis, but it’s just so cool that you can build anything you want! You can make sliding glass doors, get behavior packs so you can ride dragons, play on different worlds, and even invite your friends to join you! Another cool thing about it is that you can play on creative, adventure, or survival! In creative you can freely get blocks out of the inventory with out mining or crafting them, and you also can fly without elytra, don’t have to eat, and can last indefinitely underwater! Then in survival, you get to fight of mobs, go mining, and maybe find elytra so you can glide instead of walking or riding a horse! (Idk what adventure setting is tho 🤷🏼‍♀️) you can also go to the marketplace and by texture packs, different outfits and items, and even pre-made worlds!(one of my favorites is a snowboarding one) also, although some people seem to have glitches and stuff, I’ve never had any problems playing, and have never encountered a bug of any kind or a glitch! I’m just saying that if your undecided about wether or not to get it, it’s worth every penny and you won’t regret it!  -Someone who is obsessed with Minecraft  👁❤️⛏🧵",✨✨I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH! ✨✨

Also we have dolphins but no sharks 🦈 we zero animals in the savanna I would love to see a elephants and some giraffes, zebras and snakes would be awesome 😎 like I would definitely rate this game five stars but I really want to see more animals also whales would be 👍 great .

Also can we please, please have spawn children I need a little kid running and causing chaos around my house, I’m a only child so I really want a sis and bro 😔🥺 and to get a kid! I had to spawn twelve different villagers just to get one kid!

5,2020-07-08 15:04:33,"Mojang, thank you so much for making the best game this planet has ever seen. I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I’ve been hooked ever since. I’ve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I’m so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don’t want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don’t massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don’t realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it’s simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn’t want a cave update, but I just don’t want Minecraft to become something else.   I’m sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I’ve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don’t strip Minecraft’s simplicity from it. This is the game we grew up on, please don’t make it a different game. Thank you, and have a great day.",An Honest Opinion
5,2020-09-18 18:06:58,Minecraft is like the best game ever you can play with friend play severs and do all that you can make whatever you want in your builds. You can even add mods but there’s something that I don’t like only one thing and it’s the I used to be a mobile player I still am but I play more on my xbox it is that I can’t get any mobs on my phone that seem to work I really wanted the kitchen mod but when I downloaded it nothing poped up it could be the app that I’m getting it from bet oh well what would be a really cool update would be sharks but I don’t think we can get them and it would be cool if MOJANG could at a icon that you can click on to take you to a website or something to simply download a mod or texture packs like that would be awsome I also have some ideals that could possibly be added like maybe more foods or like more pets like a dog update the dogs not worlds dogs that have cool skins like big dogs and small dogs 🐕 🐶 like that would be so cool that’s all but Minecraft is a awsome game and you can Choos it you wanna go in a game by yourself or with your friends or with people you don’t know in a sever and the best thing is you and find treasure is a ship and a jungle temple and a desert 🐫 🐪 temple and others and you get really good loot and MOJANG if your seeing this do you think you could add these mods???? Well I got to go I recommend getting this app!!!!😍😍😍😍,BEST GAME EVER
5,2020-12-04 02:04:38,"I don’t have long to write a review, but this game is amazing. I started playing from around age 6 and have enjoyed playing this game for 6 years. Even though I feel I’ve only gotten decent recently I think this game is really fun. Not matter your trying to survive the night with your friends in survival, or building the mansion of your dreams in creative, best game ive ever played and has sculpted me as a gamer and in real life from the way I think of architecture and design. I can still remember being scared out my socks when I was only a kindle fire and it was day in the desert, and I went into a cave, then it was pitch black, I started to spin, and then I was lost. No escape. I was in survival for the first time which made it worse. Then Im spinning trying to see a light going deeper and deeper and BOOM! Got blown up by a creeper, let’s say I stuck to creative for a bit lol 😂. I love going on the MC discord and looking at all the amazing feedback I get from other players now that I have some actual good idea of what I’m doing and I’m trying to figure out redstone. One thing I would suggest, stop advertising the game as a game for little kids because even though I’m a kid I know when I’m an adult if you keep updating I’ll still be playing! But great job mojang otherwise! Woah this was a lot longer than I anticipated. Keep up the great work! -Conor",A creative masterpiece
5,2021-12-12 00:14:56,"I have played Minecraft since 2014 and I’ve loved it. They is only 2 problems and a few things I would like to be added. My 2 problems are, it sometimes glitches if I have a lot of flowers around? I’m not sure why it does this it’s kinda weird but it’s fine, my next problem is it kicks me off for no reasons once in a while, my wifi, networks, and everything else is fine but it still does it. Now on to the things I would like to add! I would like a unknown biom, what’s in it you ask? Well it has strange builds that are colorful but can be deadly but you can also find looted chest that have really good things. Another thing I would like to be added is new mobs, like whales, bears, fennec Fox’s, zombie/skeleton fish. I think those would be really good mobs. So the whales would drop whale meat which gives you speed while in water just like the dolphins but for a longer time and only when killed, the bears would drop fur which can be crafted into a rug or drop hunny, the fennec Fox would drop bug meat and when you get close they would give you speed in the desert, and the Zombie/Skeleton fish would drop fish flesh if were zombie or 2/3 bones if skeleton when killed but can attempt to attack if frightened. I hope you can fix those problems and add those things!!      And keep up the good work!  18.2",L.O.V.E
5,2020-04-02 14:53:17,"Minecraft is truly an amazing game. Reason being, how it really makes you wonder about life’s unexplored lore, and a bunch of possibilities that may come across you in the future. I recently beat the ender dragon in the bedrock version, so I decided I wanted to to stay at the credits screen and read it all the way. Which actually happened. The way the credits screen was written out really had me speechless just because of how simply powerful the language makes you imagine about life, and imagining how far you may go.  I never really thought about life that deep before, when I was still very young, but now that a few years have passed, I definitely have developed a drastically deeper understanding for Minecraft. I believe that Minecraft just isn’t a sandbox game where you can let your imagination and creativity raise the bar as high as you want, but I honestly think it’s more than just a game. The credits screen feels like you’re living a dream come true, which I feel like it’s more than just a game. This is why I’ve been sticking with Minecraft ever since the past decade, and would definitely recommend this game to anyone that is into video games. If anyone actually read this all the way until the bottom, thank you for reading. If you just started Minecraft, keep playing, you won’t regret it one bit. 😇","Thank you, Minecraft"
5,2019-07-03 11:05:13,"This game is the best game I’ve ever played in my life. It helped me when I had to get surgery. It helps me when I get home from school. Hands down this is the best game ever, and if you’re reading this you should definitely get it. It has structures to explore, over 30 biomes, achievements to get, about 85, you can playin friends worlds, in your own worlds, and if you sign in to Xbox live you can pay on servers with players across the globe. You can play worlds in survival or creative, with cheats on or off. The 5 default servers are The Hive, Lifeboat, Mineplex, Mineville City, and Cubecraft games. But there are tons of other servers around too. It constantly updates proving it won’t go out of business for a whiiiiiiiiiiile. If you’re looking for an awesome game, get Minecraft.  Suggestion: 	Maybe in the create world slot you could add more textures and not just the default. You could add past tense, or future tense, or Realistic Minecraft, whatever you want. And possibly, could you eventually add more bosses. Knowing the fact when you beat the Wither and Ender Dragon, there’s not really anything else to do. Really you could just go to end city, get achievements, that’s really all that’s important left. And maybe you could add some guns in the game. There’s only a bow and crossbow, maybe you could have an AK-47, or a Sniper Rifle, really anything just please add guns.",Love. It.

5,2021-09-02 18:02:54,Hi Mojang I love Minecraft I’ve played it since it first came out and play it everyday with my friends I tried to go the the feedback website but it didn’t work I hope you will take the suggestions into consideration with that said I would love to see new potions including one where you can use glow squid ink sacks to make a glow potion to light the player up when drank I would also love to see new paintings in the game maybe in some new sizes me and my friend think it would be cool to add a baby dragon that you can ride on when you defeat the ender dragon we also think it would be cool to add new animals and insects like snakes and butterflies it would also be cool to have glowing dyed leather armor I also think it would be cool to add all or most mob heads to the game i would also be so so so happy if you added shaders and ray tracing on Minecraft switch  I also think it is unfair that most good texture packs aren’t available for switch I really want the minebricks lego texture pack but it’s not available for switch edition I hope you take these ideas into consideration I think a lot of people including me and my friends would be happy to see these in the game and on all platform of Minecraft like switch and I want to thank everyone at Mojang for making such an awesome game.,Suggestions for things to add
5,2020-03-26 17:16:06,"Many can agree that this is the app we grew up on. This app is amazing, along with its beautiful, tear-bringing soundtrack. As I look back on the app, it has changed so much. It sounds crazy, but I almost wish it was back to the days when you lived off of cows and used boats, but now it’s all cheats and crazy builds and bees. But my favorite part has to be the soundtrack. Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don’t even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us. I know this is long, but this game is so worth it. Great job, Mojang, and Notch, and all the others. You have created history.",Minecraft
5,2020-12-17 17:00:48,"So I love Minecraft. I’m obsessed with hardcore survival through never ending creative builds. I love the nether and the end. I hope the end gets updated but that is not what I am here for. 1st of, I want to make a whole new type of Minecraft world called service. This would be a pre-server world so that you can put the build in there into a server without the whole “24 7 hour update that I waste my day on.” 2nd, I want to make a new land called “the fade.” This area would be all faded. But it wasn’t always that way... if you find and defeat the forden (A small mob that is is visible but will fade if you look at it.) If you find the power source that causes this mob to fade you cow destroy it. That mob will drop something called the Fax enchantment to gloves (which y’all should add too) and you touch something the whole world will spring with life. Then a door will appear out of no where to take you back to the over world when you are ready. This will also contain Force oars and on and on. 3rd, A time traveler. If you kill a wither, enderdragon, and forden, they will drop something called Broken map. If you place the three pieces together it will unlock something called a time traveler. This can take you to places from When those shipwrecks weren’t shipwrecks to when the villagers actually LIKED diamonds. Thanks for reading!",I can make this game better
4,2021-03-22 17:44:52,"I want to prefece thsi by saying I love this game and always have I’ve been playing Minecraft for year and it’s only gotten better. Except there are many issues that have caused me grief, one being crashing if I leave the game and come back to it it kicks me off my world and nothing will work until I close the app and reopen it. Also realms is fun but many issues one being whenever I want to put kne of my own worlds on my realm it says error and won’t cooperate I’ve found ways to get around this but still it’s unnecessary also you can’t change much about your realm once it’s made like game setting such as fire spreads and more, however I do apretiate the fact that there is automatic backups of your world constantly so you don’t lose everything. Another issue is people getting kicked from the game when they are already in it just kicks them off for no reason that it says  But besides crashing this game is so much fun there  isn’t a day when I play this I don’t enjoy besides when it crashes. Also I have the newest iPhone the 12 pro max and have these issues but my close friend with an 8 plus can’t even launch the game without it crashing, and I can’t access marketplace nothing will load and my work is decent nothing will load and I can’t make purchases besides these issues I live this game and it’s worth the money 100%",Such a good game but some issues
5,2020-05-12 21:54:47,"Minecraft is the best game ever! It has so much do to. Fight off mobs with weapons, or build a horn your own creative way. Make farms for food, enchant your weapons, and explore villages. There is so much more to do! I’ve played this since I was 4 years old and I still do! It’s AWESOME! If people hate on Minecraft, then I’m very disappointed in them. Minecraft is a one of a kind game with so much potential that it has already given us. More cool ideas can always be added. It has an awesome community, lots of servers and cool mods, and even has cool stuff like Minecon for you to look forward to. Because of COVID19, this year’s Minecon might be cancelled. I really hope not. Anyways, that is off topic to this review. I have so many good experiences playing Minecraft. I can remember worlds that me and my cousins would play in. We would build hotels and make our own parkour courses. We tested out with redefine and command blocks, too. Seriously, games like Fortnite have NOTHING against Minecraft! I’m always gonna be a Minecraft fan. I can’t wait for the new nether update coming! It’s advanced the nether A LOT! It’s just awesome! Plus, Minecraft puts out 2 big awesome updates a year. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend Minecraft. Not scary, not boring, it’s VERY fun, even if your not a gamer, there is a 99.9% chance you are going to love it!

5,2023-05-22 16:45:33,Hello There! I’m a minecraft veteran playing for almost 11 years I’ve been experiencing minecraft for alot of years now and All i recommend To add is a new structure or biome in the ocean Since the aquarium Update came out it has been years the ocean is boring now I really like if you add new things to the ocean it’s useless now And also It could be cool if you add a new structure to the end to Like “Place Of the boss of The Nether” it could be cool if you add a mob In the nether that is boss of every mobs in the nether and owns the nether Also Few bugs I noticed since the Villager and pillager update came out some stuff I noticed is that sometimes when the villagers are sleeping there are on the ground? Like this is so strange it gives creepy vibes and I hope you Could add a new ore everyone has been dying for a new ore and we really need To Get torches in our other hands it’s so useful like Java People will be happy if you add it to bedrock edition to as a feature I hope you see this Developer! I appreciate Your company and Workers Minecraft Over the years you’ve done such a work I have been playing since it came out! I hope you could listen to the community Because some of these are valid and deserved to add! Have a good day or a good night hopefully,Minecraft veteran For 11 years but got some Realization
5,2021-07-21 14:23:31,This game is one of the greatest games ever OK show me so many people like it everybody likes it it’s literally one of the worlds greatest video games ever it’s like it’s just it’s a give you memories that type of stuff you build literally like the type of stuff you do do your first time beating the other dragon and less you have memories the second time that you basically just like because stop a village from getting pillaged what else and they said like a third time third time look what I mean by like third means I mean is that what the game is amazing and like I’m just trying to like tell everybody that this game is one of the worlds greatest games I mean it would be cool Diana like sharks or like a dolphins or like if the ice villager one or the ice Pillager or one but that’s besides the point also by the way everything is gonna sound weird because like basically I’m using that Siri thing like you talk to Siri on my iPhone 11 promax hear you got flex on but seriously seriously though this game that’s awesome so if you’re thinking about getting Minecraft if you want a cool way to be able to play Minecraft on your phone go to your settings click settings app and then press press some Bluetooth and you’ll see something that says exitSo,If you don’t like this game you must be buzzed
4,2020-04-18 07:12:12,I love this game but there is a few things wrong with it now the first problem the app and Game is amazing but the price that it is it’s 6.99 that’s 7 bucks down the drain just for some pixels  problem 2 even in survival mode it gets extremely boring fast so maybe add some more portals?more mobs like a....a duck are a lizard just pleas add more animals problem 3 whenever my iPod is like 20% I definitely need to charge it but when I get bored with Gacha life I play Minecraft but whenever I click out of Minecraft it has to reload and it takes an eternity (it’s Spanish for forever)to load then I pick my world  again it takes forever 4 why are all the skins in Minecraft so expensive like I had to make my character look as nice and me as possible without spending any money so can you also fix that problem your already erning a lot of money like over 2million I think 🤔 but still at least make more skins available and free and that’s basically it sooooo.........And I don’t know if I said this already but can you make the games free pls pls pls I’m tired of searching and searching for free Minecraft worlds it’s bad enough that the game itself is 7 bucks so pls make most games free pls it would mean a lot to me if you did but yea that’s it 🤗  By:Purple Cat Chan Hai and bai🤗 Stay home and you will be safe From the COVID-19🦠🦠🦠🤗,It’s great but.........
5,2020-07-10 20:04:06,This game is so fun! I love all of the updates and in my opinion the new update every one is complaining about is actually really good! But besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore. So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn’t think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn’t have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn’t working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‘Blackstone’? I didn’t even know that existed in the game! A lot other glitches have been happening I just can’t think of all of them right now. Those glitches stood out to me the most. Overall really good game!,I LOVE THIS GAME SM
5,2023-04-27 20:10:43,"Hi Mojang! Sorry for my hate reviews on this game. I was just upset that all my progress was deleted. I hope you can forgive me. I have some suggestions for your community mob votes and some useful information. Back in 2020, the glow squid won unfairly. A Minecraft YouTuber, Dream, convinced all of his viewers to vote on the glow squid. He was very popular and the glow squid only won because of him. I have nothing against dream I’m just saying that he rigged the 2020 mob vote. A lot of people (including me) wanted the other two mobs to win. So to make it fair, please add in the moobloom and iceologer. They looked super cool, and I’m sure no one would mind. Besides, we need more naturally spawning passive fantasy mobs in the overworld, so the moobloom would be neat. I have a few suggestions. Don’t make the mob votes so late. A lot of people can only do this stuff in the day. Don’t host votes on apps like twitter or discord. Only host them on servers. Also, please add the mobs that lost. Lots of us wanted those mobs, and the fans of the winning mob will get to keep their mob, to. Win-win. Finally, make more options for mobs in mob votes. We should have 5-6 mobs to choose from. Once again I apologize for my hate reviews…I really do like Minecraft. I got it on my computer so now I can play it without having to deal with the controls. Bye!",Hi!
5,2020-04-29 05:47:08,"I’ve been playing Minecraft my whole life it feels like, but something is wrong with the custom skins. Say you download this skin from one of the skin apps and your so exited about it. Well to bad for you, you can’t wear it. I checked a million times to see if it’s just a update or something like that but it’s not! It’s super glitchy too, me and my cousins usually play together but it’s been lagging a lot. Then randomly it kicks you out and doesn’t let you join back in unless you reset the whole thing. You guys say that you keep fixing the game- but your not, your making it worse. We love that you are adding new things to the game and I’m not saying that’s the problem...but maybe...it is? I’m so excited for all the new things! Don’t get me wrong, everyone is! But there was a few I didn’t like personally. It was the customize your own skin thing you guys added not to long ago. We are happy that you tried to make the game better, except I really think you made it worse. That’s might just be me but I loved the game where we didn’t have all this glitchy stuff and we can play without that. And without that confusing customize your own skin thing. Please fix it!

5,2020-03-17 22:23:30,"I’ve been playing Minecraft since I was 7. It’s one of my favorite games to this day and I still love playing it. But I still have a few things I really want added to the game. Backpacks would be an extremely helpful feature to add to the game. On long adventures I’ve run out of space in my inventory many times. Backpacks would help solve this problem. I’ve tried to download mods for backpacks but they never work. Flying creatures such as dragons that you can ride on would be so much fun. It’s a bit of a stretch considering the only dragon in the game is the ender dragon but honestly it would be a lot of fun. Instead of having them spawn randomly maybe it can be a quest to find a dragon egg and then have some specific way to hatch it. My last suggestion is different kinds of dogs. Cats come in 11 different kinds and I would be overjoyed if dogs did too. Maybe instead of taming wolves, dogs can be separate just like cats and ocelots. Preferably I would love breeds like pugs, collies, German shepherds, huskies, corgis, golden retrievers, poodles and bulldogs. Since dog breeds all vary in sizes I would suggest making them different sizes as well. I love what mojang has done over the years with the game and I hope these suggestions will come into consideration, please and thank you.",Minecraft is amazing but it definitely needs a few updates
4,2019-04-19 17:56:06,"Okay this game is amazing. We all know that. Though I think it can be better. I’ve played Minecraft all my life, it was the only game I grew up with. It’s become a part of my life and I can’t let it go. Therefore, I come from a period of Minecraft that was simple and didn’t have much to it. Which was what I loved about it. It stood out from Call of Duty and Halo. The only reason I won’t rate it a perfect 5/5 is because of one reason. This game has become too much. Don’t get me wrong, I love this game so much to stop playing. Although, I miss it being simple and not having so many mechanics... Back to when it was a simple game, just blocks, a few things. The amazing feel of inviting your friend that was right next to you into your world, just so you guys could goof off and build some awful world. That’s what made the game special. Now this game updates faster than half of the other Minecraft versions. It’s basically Minecraft Java, but mobile. I hate it. It doesn’t have that same feeling. Though, like said before, it’s not like I can just let this game go. So I’m still here playing it. I just wish that it was more how it was before. Before minecoins, the xbox live sign in, the new blocks that don’t even have a purpose.

4,2023-05-28 21:26:01,"Okay, I just want to say that Minecraft is an amazing game. But, when I was playing with my friend in a world and we were making a city, when i left a building i made, there was thunder and lightning but no rain. I get scared a lot but I knew it was a sign of Herobrine I told my friend to leave immediately and I did. But my friend said that the game said, “You cannot do this right now.” When he pressed save and quit. He had to stay in the game and then he literally saw me in the game when i wasn’t and he said that i had white eyes and I was just staring at him. I wasn’t even in the game when he said that I was there with white eyes. It creeped us out so much. And i get scared super easily. Then the game started making all of the mobs float up into the air, even the NPCs we made and they all fell down and died. Then my friend saw a whole bunch of skeletons and slimes and the world was on peaceful. Then and only then was when my friend was able to leave the world. Then he decided to make a copy of the world just in case. After that all of his battery went out on his Xbox and on his iPad at the same time. I’m just informing you about this because we worked really hard on the world. And i got super scared 😟 and it got him scared too. I’m also informing you about this because it might help you catch him.","This is such a good game, but i encountered Herobrine"

Sure, updates do take long, but don't blame Mojang! They are trying their best to satisfy us. So why don't we just take a moment to appreciate Minecraft? For all you good-rating people out there, keep being awesome to motivate and give happiness to this game and Mojang! 😇😇😇 That's all I wanted to say, goodbye!

I think you guys deserve a round of applause and take a break, it's really hard to develop! I'm one of the people who try to help people with their emotions. Thank you Mojang for this wonderful game!! :)  [Edit]  My only suggestion/reminder (for Mojang only) is the servers. When I played a very popular yet unofficial Minecraft server, it kicked me out 2 hours later because of an unknown reason. It said I had to wait 2 hours until I could join again, but I've been working on it for a year and it still says the same problem! Please work on it Mojang, it is very, very annoying.

4,2020-07-03 00:41:42,"I love Minecraft and have playing since it was on the Xbox 360, and I have loved everything about it! But recently it’s been laggy, glitchy and it even crashes when I try to play. Normally the game isn’t that slow but when ever I’m not on WiFi or have a poor connection , it takes 5 minutes to just to make the type of world that I want! Before the game would be a little slower than normal, but never THAT slow. I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash! And oddly enough when I try to pause the games it would take over 5 minutes for it to load the menu. Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection. The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers. The game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition. And the in-game shop has a few free skins, worlds and has deals that are often good. However, when there isn’t a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won’t have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins.   TL;DR Good game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates. Has some bad glitches but bearable.",On a scale of 1-10 it would be a 8
5,2019-03-23 21:29:50,"I’ve loved this game since I was really young. It is such a great way to be creative in more ways than just “placing blocks.” You can use math, science, art, architecture, music, and so much more in this incredible app. There are literally endless possibilities, and with the new updates, 2019 could quite possibly be its best year yet. My only problem is when it comes to texture packs, the really large and quite amazing ones like VanillaBDCraft don’t work on my phone. They cause the whole app to crash. I’m not sure if it’s a bug, but other than that, I have no problems with the game. The only other thing I wish would be changed is the variety of blocks. You have slabs, staircases, and full blocks, but there aren’t any smaller cubes aside from heads and you can’t have sideways slabs or staircases. I think this is a hug limitation in what is possible for art and architecture in Minecraft. With it, there could be so many more possibilities and overall efficient and better-looking builds. And don’t get me started on the Minecraft Store. That thing just gets on my nerves. Why is the most expensive texture pack in the store so simple? And the description of it isn’t professional at all. Other than these things, I have no problem with Minecraft and enjoy playing pretty much everyday.","Infinite Wonders, Endless Possibilities"
5,2018-01-24 00:04:05,"Look, I appreciate Minecraft so much. I feel like it has been reading my reviews (on different accounts). I ask for enderpearls, stained glass, etc and they ALL add to Minecraft pe in order. So, here’s two more things that I need last. One being shields and number two being capes. We had capes for a while, but then it got patched down. A lot of Minecraft players were upset about this, and those groups of players included me. Now, I’m still keeping five stars because I wouldn’t know where I’d be without this amazing game, Minecraft. I made lots of friends and when I found out that they played as well, we played until 4 in the morning! Anyway, back to the shields now. Xbox and PC have this now. Im not sure about the Switch, but I really want to play using shields. If Mojang is going to let us merge games with different consoles, then it wouldn’t be fair if they had shields and we didn’t. See what I mean? Now that we merged, I have been looking for shield every update but all we got was Mixer LiveStreaming, Bug Fixes, and Minor Improvements. I would be a bit disappointed if Mojang “forgot” about shields, but I would also totally get it. Everyone makes mistakes. But I hope this is read and useful. Thank you, creators, for this amazing game that took me so far. Thank you. Thank you so much. Have a great day!",BEST MULTIPLAYER GAME EVER!
4,2020-06-02 19:30:11,"Dear Mojang,  I’ve been playing Minecraft for years now and I love it but there is a bug that keeps happening every time. Anyways I made a survival world to unlock all the achievements there. And it was working fine but now it freezes from time to time and I can’t exit the game but I can still move so I wait about five minutes and nothing is happening. So I keep getting out the game and coming back but when I come back some of my stuff is not saved and it sometimes deletes my animals which is really annoying because it’s hard to find more horses that are fast. So I just take a break for a while and I come back. When I come back it seems to be working ok again, so I make a nether portal and go in to try and find the temple. I eventually find it and then head back to my house to get prepared and get better armor and stuff. Ok so I go back to the nether and it freezes again!!! So I exit out the game and get back on and enter the nether again, again it freezes so I keep leaving and coming back and nothing is working! I worked so hard on that world and now I won’t let me go back to the nether without freezing!!! I’ve already reported the bug to Mojang. Hopefully it will be fixed in the next update because I really just wanted to have fun and beat the game for once. Please help me it needs to be fixed!! Thank you.              -Annelise",I love it but..
5,2019-07-14 18:26:43,"I love Minecraft it’s a great game but I wish they had more animals for and more interactions with pets like, pets can have stats and you can train them like some stats could be Combat, or speed and adding more animals like snails, Slugs, Racoons, Rats, Mice, Goats, More pets, Snakes, and more, but I really want is more food! I think you could add food like More pies, More Fruit, More Vegetables, More Soup, Coconut milk from coconuts, Chocolate milk, Strawberry milk, Fruits I want to be added in soon but it’s okay if these will be in a later update you can take all the time you need to add these like dragon fruit, bananas, Avocado, Pear, Cactus fruit, Mangosteen, Mangos, Lychee, Pineapple, Grapes, Green Apple, Peach, Oranges, Blueberries, Plums, and tons more if you are reading this thank you for reading this Minecraft is one of my favorite games I have had since I was little normally I don’t write reviews but Minecraft is just something I felt like I had to do and I was thinking maybe adding Venus fly traps and flys, maybe more flowers?, onions, and more types of fish like, bass, catfish, and possibly whales! It would be amazing if in a later update one of these are in it. Minecraft is I think one of the first games I got and I remember back then what it was like compared to now it has improved so much thank you for working hard on Minecraft :)😁🤗😋❤️❤️👍🏻",I love Minecraft but...
5,2022-02-23 05:24:18,I like Minecraft because you can play different modes instead of just playing survival or playing on creative mode. Because some times you want to build an entire city in Minecraft and sometimes you want to see how long you can survive in the wild by playing a game. This app has also been on my phone for as long as I’ve had my phone at all! Definitely say that this is longest lasting app on my phone that has been fun for years in a row. And I’ve seen different knock-offs of Minecraft and tried them to see if they’re any better and none of them were. Minecraft is also the ONLY game on my phone that has ZERO ads whatsoever you can just play and won’t be bothered by ads like other games. As great as this all is there just one small thing that would make a huge change on the game. I think that when you pause the game everything in game pauses too because there have been multiple times where I have been killed by a zombie In the game because the game didn’t actually pause. But other than that there’s nothing to complain about in this game. And I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn’t played. And this is by far one of those games that people would have HAVED to play at some point in their life.,Great game 👍 it
5,2019-12-07 19:41:50,"This game is fantastic, but there are a few things that I really think need to be fixed: 1. You cannot place carpet under ladders and doors. It is really annoying and I hope it can be fixed. 2. VOLCANOS! There should definitely be so,e volcanos, ones that are erupting and not. I also think that before creating a new world you should be able to deactivate the volcanos if you wanted. 3. It would be really great if there were different kinds of dogs, especially if there are different types of cats. For example, there are Siamese cats, black cats, orange cats etc...but there is only one kind of dog. I also think that’s there should be wolf spawners (which there is) AND dog spawners for the villages. There are cat and ocelot spawners, but not for dogs. 4. For the people that want the old Minecraft back, the simple one, I don’t think Mojang should change Minecraft, I want Mojang to keep adding more exciting things. HERES MY IDEA SO EVERYONE IS PLEASED: before creating a new world, you should be able to check/cross off certain blocks, mobs, animals etc...this will make it so it’s simpler if you want it to be. For example, you want a world with no cheats, no ravagers, pillagers and dolphins, just cross them off and boom, back to old simple Minecraft.  Anyways, thank you so much for creating this amazing game, I am forever grateful!","Amazing game, but..."
4,2018-04-06 02:01:04,"I absolutely love Minecraft but I don’t love the new update that just came out. For example my inventory is weird. I personally like using the classic version instead of pocket and ever since the last update both versions is very glitchy and it doesn’t show the name of the item. Additionally, when you press an item it sort of highlights the box and I don’t like it. In addition to the latest update I have some suggestions for the new update to make it more enjoyable. 1- New breeds of dogs and cats! I feel that Minecraft needs more dog and cat types to kinda freshen it up and for it to be more interesting. 2- More food! Maybe coffee, sandwiches, burgers, French fries, etc would make it cool. 3- Crazy Craft! I see you tubers (ldshadowlady,smallishbeans,etc) using crazy craft on their computers and I think a free version on Minecraft PE so that all players could get crazy craft and play like the minecrafters they look up to would be really nice! 4- Cameras and Phones. I feel like we need a technology update. I think working phones, computers, cameras, and any thing technological would be really cool to add to the game. Finally, more furniture! Couches, vanity’s, toilet bowls, mirrors, closets and basically anything you would find in a house! I think that, that idea is really cool and would attract many players! If you can do this than thank you! Sorry for being so needy :(",I LOVE Minecraft but....
4,2019-07-10 22:48:29,"I mean Minecraft is a good game. It’s fun and there’s also loads of servers but there is one problem for me. I think you guys updated the game a little too much for the multiplayer part. I love the whole water updates and all that but the multiplayer part is just making the worst in my opinion let me explain. When Minecraft first came out it was sooo easy to join each other all you had to do was be close to the person you wanted to play with and then join. But now you have to have this whole account thing and it’s just waayyy too complicated. And I can’t even join my friends because it just doesn’t work and when it does they immediately get kicked out for some reason and that’s the only reason why I liked Minecraft and now I can’t even play with my friends. But yet again that’s just my opinion. Also I’m on iOS so that may be the problem but idk?🤷‍♀️ Hello me again I have decided to update my review a bit more 💀 I think that you could make this game that 19x better by adding... MORE BIOMS!!!! This game is amazing but to be honest I get kinda tired of just seeing the same bioms over and over again but other that that still an awesome game and I love the new village and cat updates!! 🍬 Oh and one more thing.... you should definitely make jungle, Mesa and mushroom island villages..!! But other that that awesome game🍭🍼",Updated a little too much🤷‍♀️
5,2019-08-20 13:19:16,"This is a great game and I love everything that’s been added recently. But there are a few things that would make the game a bit more interesting. Such as carts that horses or mules could pull, and the player could put stuff in it. Armor for animals like dogs, and cats. It would also be nice to have more birds, like sparrows, hawks, falcons, cardinals, eagles, etc. and something I’ve been wanting since forever, backpacks and torches that light up surrounding areas when held in the hand. Those two things would be very useful for the more adventurous type who don’t like to settle down.  There is one thing that I think would make Minecraft off the charts great. If the terrain wasn’t as poorly generated as it is now and it has smooth transitions to each biome. With true mountains that reach the max build height and unbelievably large caverns that dominate the underground. It would make the sense of adventure so much more incredible if a player could wander into a town and visit a tavern and hear the local news or stumble upon a mighty castle in the mountains. A YouTuber named Jeracraft transforms old Minecraft structures like villages and jungles temple into breathtaking structures and makes mountains realistic.  And something a bit more manageable would be to increase the world build height to something like 400 or even 500.",Great game
4,2020-02-08 02:25:13,"Okay, I legit love Minecraft, I have been playing since 2016. Now, every time I get signed into my Xbox Live account my Minecraft always jams. It doesn’t let me on. When I do get in it doesn’t load my world, so I’m just stuck there for 30+ minutes. Also I’ve bought mine coins and they won’t load in the marketplace. Right now I should have 100 mine coins after my purchases. They just don’t load, the things I’ve bought don’t load either. Recently Minecraft locked my account and idk why. The marketplace wouldn’t load, like I physically could not click the button to open it. It said that there was “an account error” so I just played as an LAN player to play with my friends. Anyways, I got that issue fixed but now my Minecraft won’t load anymore, no severs, it says “coming soon” when I open that tab. Ironically it worked better and would load and let me play with my friends when I was an LAN player. Another thing is the skins. When I try to put in a new skin it just gives me the one i had before, or it just goes invisible and I’m legit a ghost as I play. It’s honestly annoying. I paid for this app with my own money and I would very much like it to work. I love it, so I really don’t want to have to delete it but rn, it looks like I might have to. Could like Mojang get this fixed please? Thank you for your time.",Please fix this issue
5,2020-11-29 18:04:53,"I LOVE THIS AP! It has been my favorite app for so long! I started playing at a really young age, and through all the updates, it grown on me more and more to where I could have gotten the “Passing The Time” achievement a million times! But I feel like it’s missing something that could make the game so much more fun! We just got the nether update which is SO COOL AND FUN but we need an End update. It’s the boss battle of the game! And it’s just an island floating on the void with a dragon on it and some creepy guys that kill you if you look at them. The end ship is really fun to raid but I feel like I’d rather go to the nether that not the End because it’s a little boring. Also, my MAIN request, MORE MOBS!! please!!! We need more mobs! We can add in different colored cows and chicken and add new features to some of them! We can have bears, owls, dogs, bulls, monkeys, RED pandas, elephants, and more!! Hedge hogs, tigers, lions, UNICORNS, DRAGONS, GHOSTS!!! It would be Soo fun if we had those updates and I know it’s a lot of work but it would be SO fun!!!!!!!!!!!! Please! We can have different types of trees with yellow leaves, purple leaves, red, orange, blue, magenta!! We also might need different types of dye and flowers and maybe a whole new biome..

5,2019-04-19 02:13:12,"I played way back in the day. Minecraft PE was fresh off the market. There were no baby animals, spawn eggs, and gravel and sad didn’t fall! And best of all I remember the “Nether Castles,” massive nether forts made from very costly materials just so us PE users could get a feel for the nether. And I remember spending countless hours building building building. I loved it! I recreated some really cool worlds. For instance, I recreated Mean Street in Epic Mickey. But now as the new and exciting updates are being pushed out, PE falls behind. Not in the content! The content lacking version is the PlayStation version. But the bugs and the many glitches hurt us. I get it! It’s impossible to make the perfect game but sometimes the game fails to read simple inputs when I’m hitting the move forward button. This is just an example. Pros outweigh the cons all day. But what’s a review for if the developers don’t read them and consider how to fix it. I believe Microsoft is a very listening company and will hopefully listen to the PE community. Maybe they’ll take a moment and let the game breath! Push the new and exciting update back just a little bit and have an Operation Health😉 The game needs it and we want it. Love your work Microsoft/former Mojang! Keep it up regardless.

5,2022-02-13 21:15:22,"Minecraft has been along for a while. I can remember when it was free on the App Store, and I got it. Before me, it was my dad who showed me the ways of Minecraft. We would play together. And the more I grew, the game grew too. Next thing you know, the games adding axolotls and goats! It’s so amazing how much this game has expanded and grew over the years. I mean, it’s a bit more difficult with making skins and stuff like that, and with those brand new skin updates, at first I was mad at them, but I learned how to control it and all. The more it grew, the less people (at least my friends) played it. I stoped after a while. After among us came out, it’s the only thing people would talk about and the only thing I would play. No one really liked Minecraft anymore, but my little sister played it. I learned from her it doesn’t matter if it’s popular, because it’s still awesome. I am happy I grew up with this app. It is and always will be my favorite game. Even if it’s old, it’s the best game in the world. The only thing that would make me cry in happiness is if FNAF did a mash-up with Minecraft Thank you for reading this. 😊BTW I got this glitch when I got free mine coins. I didn’t mind.

4,2018-06-14 22:32:21,"I love to play this game, and I have about two worlds. My main world I’ve had for about three years now and my old iPod that it’s on is starting to get outdated. Im still on IOS9, and the game lags sooo much, especially when friends are joining the world. I’m just worried I might lose the world if I can’t update Minecraft or the phone breaks. This world is really special to me, and I would be disappointed if it got lost. I have an iPhone 8, along with my old iPod. All I’m asking from you is one thing. Please please please add a feature where you can download your friends worlds onto your device. This will allow me to get my favorite world onto my new iPhone, and not have to worry anymore about losing it. I understand that it is probably really hard to add features out of the blue, and that it may take time, but please! I would love you guys forever if you did that. I know some other people who have this problem, and it would probably help many other people if you could put this into Minecraft pocket edition. I realize that there are bugs in the game right now, but honestly, I won’t mind if this feature was added. Please... that is all I want. Now that I think about it, no one will probably ever see this that can make this happen... but whatever, I’ll put it out there for some ideas. Thank you.","This is a great game, but one thing..."
5,2019-04-11 11:50:18,"I love Minecraft! Though there a few additions that I see as needed. Flying animals, as we only have one tamable flying animal. Maybe there could be snowy owls that fly over tundras, ice spikes, and snowy forests, that you could either tame with fish ( or any meat )or steal an egg from a nest in a snowy forest to hatch. Once tamed you could possibly be able to let the snowy owl out and it could come back in a couple of days with a gift of meat. There could also be barn owls, screech owls, and great horned owls, that soared over forests ( no snow), and possibly grass lands with the same properties as the snowy owl. There could also be just normal birds in forests like blue jays, robins, cardinals, doves, crows Etc. Now that the real flying animals have been covered, this brings us to dragons! Maybe there could be one dragon nest in the heart of every biome with an egg guarded by a grown dragon that you have to defeat to get the egg, possibly when you get close the dragon nest the dragon will start slowly stalking your character. Then once you get the egg it will hatch in an area with lots of light. Then once full grown you can make a saddle and put chests on it for storage, and fly it! Maybe you must also give it lots of meat every now and then to take care of it or it will become feral. I hope you read this/ like the ideas mojang!",Few additions needed
2,2018-11-12 01:03:52,"This game is very fun except sometimes you have to start completely over and reset everything! This has happened to me twice before, and each time I had multiple very accomplished worlds. What happens is that one second, it’s working just fine, and then when you try to get on it next time, you can’t even make it to the loading screen without it crashing. When this happens, it keeps happening, and you can’t get onto your Minecraft, not even onto your home screen, so you can try to find out what is wrong. Every time this happens to me, it is completely hopeless, and I end up deleting Minecraft. Then, when I redownload it, I lose all of my worlds, skins, servers, and everything except your Xbox live account, which you have to log back into. It is the most annoying thing ever, and I hate it so much. The reason I am actually writing this review is because I am hoping someone at Mojang will see it, and try to troubleshoot the problem. Also, when I tried to look up my problem on Minecraft forums, it looked like a bunch of other people have had the exact same problem, and it’s not getting fixed. If this problem doesn’t get fixed, I’m deleting Minecraft altogether because it was a complete waste of my money.

Once I installed the update and opened up minecraft, what would normally be the Mojang logo was a black rectangle, and when the loading screen popped up the game crashed, and this is even after the new hotfix thing. On my opinion I suggest ( this is for Mojang ) that you guys fix it because I am one of the biggest minecraft fans I know. And even though I stayed within the terms of use I got kicked off my Microsoft account, and that is where all my minecoins and mashups are saved to. 😜 it is still a good game if you like building though!👾 you also get to survive dangerous mobs and explore strongholds, find the end portal and defeat the Ender Dragon if you like that kind of stuff.

5,2022-01-16 04:38:49,"So I first got this game around the aquatic update and for years I didn’t realize how big of a game this was. Years later I am familiar with the history and future of Minecraft. This game lets imagination flow freely from your heart and brain straight into a giant 3D canvas, filled with many things to explore but at the same time has plenty of space to create whatever comes to mind. One thing I noticed is that the case with most games is that they do a great job on it for a long time but then it is changed too much and it loses its signature style of game. However, this is not the case with Minecraft. Minecraft has changed so much throughout the years but it still keeps the same style gameplay. Every update seems to be an improvement to the already great game. The community it really nice and Mojang always listens to suggestions and keeps us hyped for the next update. That is all I would like to add, if you don’t already have this game, I would highly recommend this game for anybody with an imagination. Thank you for giving the time to read this review.  P.S. If you are new and notice that there are a few bugs here and there just be patient with it as a new update has been released and it will be a bit buggy.",Fantastic Game!!!
5,2019-08-14 16:08:56,"So I’ve been playing this game since before it was even a thing. What I wish came back was old servers. Ya there is a setting to go to servers that end, but those old servers, now they are like a mod. I was thinking for your next update, you should make more world settings that you can change to make it more advanced. For example, making it so you can put in words for the seed instead of just numbers. I mean, you could do that in old Minecraft. Also, a change that I’ve seen is the death sound was removed, I loved that sound man, animals walk around holes now, so you gotta do even more work to get let’s say carrots or wheat, the mountains that are added to servers, ya they don’t got any openings on them where you can build a house, in old Minecraft, everyone did that, and just the fact that old seeds don’t work breaks my heart. I had this server called the creeper cave server, right? No one knows the seed, and you can’t type it in either. I would tell you the seed, but it is on my kindle fire that is broke. What I’m saying is, you should make adjustments or even make a whole new game where it was just like the old days. And in my opinion, there was no downside, just the fact that updates overtook what I knew about Minecraft.",I wish you brought back the old Minecraft

Servers are gone the mine store is gone it crashes randomly, I mean seriously I love this game but it seems like you don’t care about this platform. No snapshots why is the red stone completely different. I’d understand if there was actually something holding you back from changing it but there isn’t. You need Xbox live just to play on a server. Not to mention how unbalanced pvp is mobile vs pc. If we get it we can’t attack back because it stops you when you take damage. And it will randomly freak out and make the screen shake all over the place when you try to look around. My god either act like we exist and bring us as close to the others as we should be or admit you don’t care about mobile Andy more and that no updates are happening to fix it. 70% of the updates are “bug fixes” but nothing has changed still no servers will no store still no character creator. It’s sad to see such a well received game run into the ground by new management that cares for nothing but profit. The minstore itself is ruining the game....

I was really irritated, and so I cheated, yeah, sorry, but I went into creative, then flew back, and I went back, started flying around. Couldn’t find my bridge, then I found another endcity portal. Like the bedrock diamond that you throw a ender pearl into to reach endcites. So I threw it in bc I was curious. And, I ended up in the battle arena where you fight the ender dragon. I was confused, but I wasn’t to bothered.

The free worlds we get are still there. We only lost the packs that cost money.

Another thing would be that if y’all would add new weapons like battle axes and scythes. Now with the final part of the battles we need soldiers and minions. That would be awesome my brother and me have had a bunch of ideas like Armed Soldier where they spawn in these things called Bases they drop ammo and different guns. Now for building, I liked the textures on the some off the beautiful blocks in this game but where is the furniture like couches, chairs, and other furniture and appliances like plates and cups. I would like to see this in the game it would make it better. I just looked at the new update Aquatic and I liked it a lot, me personally I like the way that Mojang added vibrant and more life in the oceans and bodies of water in Minecraft   Mojang if you’re reading this I hope you add some of these things to make your game a tad bit better and this has been Lunatic0914 I’m out later",Minecraft Review

5,2022-03-07 05:25:04,"I’ve always loved Minecraft. Ever since I was a little kid and all I had was a kindle. I’ve seen things come to this game that I could have never imagined, and I remember my first experience in Minecraft. My cousin had it on his iPod and showed me around his base that he made in the clouds. I was instantly hooked. Gameplay since then has very much improved, though I do dislike the newest 1.18 updates, mostly because it makes certain aspects of the game more annoying to deal with. Yes I understand most don’t agree with me but it’s something you should at least think about. Minecraft wasn’t meant to be a super challenging game at its base, it’s meant to be something you kick back for hours and relax with. The new caves make exploring a good bit more challenging, and while most like a challenge, it shouldn’t be forced on you to begin with. You challenge yourself, that’s what makes the challenges that were in the game fun. Like I said though, the game is still amazing and definitely on my top 10 games list, likely there to stay. My take is likely due to me just liking the past and not really trying to adapt to the new caves but eh, don’t let my on pe measly review change your view of the game.",Still one of the best games out there
2,2021-11-30 16:41:24,"Minecraft, the sand box game that is great and all but there’s some things that need to be added or fixed. This may include update ideas or bugs and glitches or just thing you need to add back in. 1: Bundles are helpful items used for carrying things easily but for some reason they weren’t added in caves and cliffs part 2. We’ve been waiting a long time for these items but they weren’t in the update please add bundles. 2: The end dimension is kinda boring, the concept is cool going to a mysterious dimension and battling a mighty dragon. It’s cool but really there’s nothing there really the only things you can do there is defeat the ender dragon get the egg and get a elytra and then you really have no reason to ever come back so I think it will be a cool idea if you made a end update with new mobs new biomes and more because the end is just a void right now so please add a end update (And no 2 parts). 3: Why did you remove old world generation the ones that give you a limited space. Please atleast  that give us the world border command. 4: A bug I got was one day in the list of seeds I was missing the survive island seed. The next the survive island seed was back but the epic jungle seed was gone few days later the survive island seed was gone and the epic jungle seed was back. That was some of my thoughts so far I will probily made a part 2 of my reviews but that’s it for now please fix or add some of these thing bye.",Another review
5,2020-09-19 22:48:58,Hi I have been playing Minecraft since I was about 4 or 5 I’ve showed it to my friend and family and we all love it I even got my daddy playing it although all of my family and friends also agree how some of the new things are causing massive glitches like the character creator on that the Skinseed dosent work in multiplayer anymore and we have to spend both money and time to get the look we want to share here is another glitch I’m trying to get a pack from let’s say Noxcrew and I’m getting elf patrol or something well I’ve been sitting there so long and it say purchase in progress this shouldn’t take long well spoiler alert it does and it never works I try everything swiping all my apps up on mobile powering of my tablet  waiting and it won’t work I managed to get one and it was not even very fun I really want this one game from no crew and it just will not work I am really disappointed 😔 in these glitches another glitch that happens is sometimes if the app suddenly thinks you should delete something it constantly kicks you out and does not make a backup this does not happen as often as it used to but it’s still a problem for many people thank you for your time for reading this and I hope you have heard me goodbye Mojang. 🙂,Glitches
5,2020-09-14 13:52:37,I have been playing since it came out and I love it soooo much and I feel like the next update should have like chairs in different colors and tables you can place anything on remember it’s just a suggestion and my a more modern type of furnace and a fridge cuz my and my siblings love making houses so it would be good for decore and maybe some drawers and a kitchen cabinet and a closet as I said 3 times I’m just suggesting you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to but I always will love playing Minecraft but also there has been worse glitches since the last update like when I put something in my inventory it won’t go out I try removing it but doesn’t go 2nd is when I’m playing or I’m trying to enter or join a world I get kicked out the hole game of course cuz I like playing it I try to find solutions but some times it don’t work and my game sometimes freezes and then it kicked me out I’m just saying but you do you it’s an amazing game and I will always keep playing live the game it’s amazing but if you are willing to do the next update suggestion I would love them to be able to be different colors but as I said you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to thank you for mak ni Minecraft I love it 😀😀,I LOVE THE GAME THIS IS SUGGESTION FOR NEXT UPDATE and problem glitch
5,2018-12-31 12:48:18,"Minecraft Is a AWESOME game. And I am never bored when it’s around. It feels like everything is possible! Creating is Awesome. And its hard in real life to build and get materials, and It would take a long time. In Minecraft it can take one day and you have a awesome creation Next to you. Its fun to make your world your favorite way. Also I can choose exactly what I start out with. I can do survival or creative, easy or hard, normal or peaceful, and I get to pick my seed. You can also explore which is really fun. You get to challenge yourself and fight which I love. If you don’t gave Minecraft I don’t know how you live.  Also you can buy stuff in the store. You can get a world made for you. I bought luxury life and can’t stop playing. It was so worth the money. You can also buy textures for your worlds. You can change the look of you character and buy new looks or skins.  And finally you can play with friends. You can come into your friends worlds or you can have friends come into yours. If you have a Xbox you can play on a world with 1000 other people or so. It is funner when a friend is in your game. It makes everything go much faster. It won’t be as scary hen your fighting monsters. Go get Minecraft right now. Don’t forget what I said.",Everything Is possible!
5,2021-02-23 02:07:14,"Minecraft is absolutely fantastic. I’ve been playing for a few years and lately I’ve really observed on how much this game has evolved. So many things have changed but that has made it even better! You can do so many spectacular things, especially with your imagination when it comes to it. As soon as I open Minecraft I already have hundreds of ideas! I love the graphics, it may not be some other people’s kind of things such as my fathers, and I respect that decision. Though Minecraft will always be a favorite of mine, I will NEVER but less than 5 stars of rating on Minecraft. I love how it instructs you on how to play, I love how you may add textures, buy skins, and add shaders. It makes the game an even better experience. I don’t think I have any problems, none to be exact. Though I do think you should put shaders in the stores, i don’t think there’s any... you can usually only find them on websites and though it is right in front of you, it’s a very large and confusing process to add them to game. Other then that it’s an amazing game, if I could give a higher rating, I would. Though I sadly can’t, in my perspective, for this game my 5 stars means a 20 or higher. I love all of you creators so much!! Thank you for this awesome game! 🤎💚",Fantastic. 🌳🐴🐮🐺
5,2020-11-04 15:47:12,"Hey there creators, I know that it is a pain to make huge updates, but we need something different than the end and the nether, we need a new dimension that is harder than ever before, we need new item, new tools, I mean like 2 or three different types of tools , make a way to create something like dual weapons, maybe armor that allows us to fly at end game, the update after that, make it where the armor is even better. We need new things to keep us interested. Armor that allows us to fly is my main objective, I suggest calling it a supremium ingot, it starts with finding supremium debri that  gives us supremium essence when we dig it, and when we finish mining that and we go to use it we have to use a special crafting table made out of pure blocks of gold that is really hard to craft, and please make larger chest, please do, when the ingots are formed we can turn that into supremium armor and tools, make the tools do 12 attack damage and it has a bleeding effect too please, add dark matter essence that creates block that we use for a portal and only can be mines in the nether , this is just some ideas i thought of but I am sure flying armor would satisfy many people along with new dimensions as well,",This Game Needs Something New
5,2022-10-02 13:46:15,When I first played Minecraft my brother put it on hard mode and I was only like five years old!!!!! nobody even explain to me how to play it! but I will explain to you! Minecraft is a wonderful game it’s a pixelated game or you can build anything you want to survive and take out a dragon! that’s how you beat the game on survival mode! survival mode is where you could possibly die if you put it on easy normal or hard mode in the settings then there will be monsters if you put it on hard mode there will be the most monsters! if you put it on creative mode then you can build till your hearts content if I could I would give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ that many stars I also like how there’s always new updates the updates are the best!! it made me excited when they added frogs to Minecraft anyway it always makes me excited to update it because Minecraft always has so many updates I love the new Redwood style anyway if you want to build and survive or whichever way you want to play then go ahead and download it! you can play with friends and there are special things that allow you to do stuff that regular Minecraft can’t do on the marketplace! there’s also specific apps that allow you to do that!!!,BEST APP EVER
5,2019-06-16 14:02:27,"I have been playing this game since 2014, and it was just... amazing! I loved how it was this pixelated world where you could make anything you imagined in block form! I really liked survival mode, where it’s like your the person who will conquer enemies and help the world! It kinda helped me prepare for a zombie apocalypse, or a disaster! I thought this type of game wouldn’t have existed if Minecraft hadn’t had released into the world of games! Throughout all, I think it’s a pretty good game! It inspires people to use their imagination and to just create it! Although, there are a few things within the game that kinda bother me. So you have to have a account to play in servers, and that’s just a bit unfair to those who don’t have one, or aren’t able to get one onto Minecraft. I understand if there’s a thing that’s blocking that, so I completely understand. Another thing is getting free worlds. Sometimes after I purchase a free world from the shop, it has a red exclamation mark, and it says ‘your account’ something-something, I can’t remember. Those are the problems I have with the game, but they aren’t so bad! Anyways, I hope you read this!                                    Good work on the game!                                                       -¿¿¿",My Minecraft Review!

4,2019-05-21 21:05:13,"So I play The PC version a lot more. I say that because I think that the PC version is the only version that hasn’t been ruined. The PC version is so enjoyable because it’s still original. Microsoft hasn’t touched it. If they do, I think we’re all gonna be pretty ticked off. The only reasons I hate MCPE is because of the inventory and the store. The inventory is bad because of how it’s organized. Nature? What happened to foodstuffs and decorations? The only think that is practically the same is the combat section minus the potions. The other reason I hate the inventory is the grouping. I hate having to open a menu IN my inventory for one single block or item.  The store is bad because it just is. Yea, you can’t download a map on a phone or tablet. But you shouldn’t have to pay real money for one dinky little world. The PC version can just look up a map, find the URL, download it, and just play it. But that’s only because it’s a computer. I’m pretty sure a phone can’t handle that sort of thing. And the only reason downloading worlds with real money is because it’s just Microsoft trying to rip you off. You can literally just download an app to find original worlds, texture packs, etc. Yes, most apps are shams that you have to pay for anyways, but there are plenty free, good apps. Please, fix Minecraft.",There’s still a chance...
4,2020-04-12 22:05:25,"You should really get this game and this is not a complain but there should be more animals in this game because i have been playing this game for a long long time and I’m getting tired of the mobs, and also u should add some more dog like things to the dog, u know, being able to make them lay down and fetch and sleep and play, and there’s should be more types of dogs and you should also be able to give them a collar with a tag and u should be able to color change the tag. And be able to take the tag off and there should be more animals and the villages should be more like neighborhoods and a grocery market and the villagers should be more like people and a pet store and the villagers should have names and there should be emojis and they use those to show their feelings and u can be buddy. Back to the dogs, you should add dog beds, chew toys, and make it like the stuff that “StacyPlays” has and make a copy of her world and u must know her because she came and talked to u so u should make a copy of her world and there should be dog biscuits and be able to make them roam follow and make them attack what u want and there should be dog bowls LIKE STACY PLAYS!

5,2022-02-22 23:40:59,"I rate this a 5/5 because Minecraft is such a fun game! You can build anything you want, and basically let you’re imagination run wild. There’s different modes like creative, survival, ect. The updates are really cool and also this game has progressed a long way. I do have some suggestions though. For the next update, maybe adding small details to the game like in caves tiny rocks on the ground or the water animation being a bit smoother. Second, maybe add some more animals, or adding detail to them. Minecraft has most animals we commonly know, but maybe adding a few more bugs like spiders. Also adding frogs or snakes I know would be hard but it would be cool if you could add animals like that, reptiles, jungle animals like Jaguar and monkeys, African animals like lions and giraffes, ect. Adding more objects to the game could also be a nice touch. Don’t get me wrong, there’s A LOT of objects and blocks you can use in Minecraft, though maybe adding simple furniture or more precise details would make Minecraft just that much better. If you do come across this, thank you for reading this and I hope you thrive making this game the best it can be.

5,2021-04-19 14:28:39,"I have loved Minecraft for a long time. I have recently gotten myself an account. The whole reason why is wanted one was to play with my friends. Sadly, I cannot play on their worlds, and they can’t on mine. When ever I clicked their world button to join, it goes through some loading screens. And then it shows a screen with a classic dirt background saying: Unable to join world. Many others are also having this problem. Also, I like playing on Mineplex. There is a game in it called Master Builders. I love playing, but it is really hard because chunks won’t load, and chat, and inventory take long to open. Every time I play, my chunks barely load. And when it is time to judge, I can’t see anything except the players. (Note: at the time I was playing, the server had low PNG. I don’t know if thats good or bad, but I think it’s good.) Also, can you make it so the world audio is different than the whole game audio. I don’t want to hear music in the background when I’m in a world, but I do when I’m at the Minecraft Home Screen.

5,2020-07-29 13:45:45,I love love this game played a lot when I was in preschool and now I’m in first grade even if it cost money now it’s OK but I just wanted to tell you a few updates I would like one I would like if you could add a water bar because if the water bottles for just the potions or else it can be for a water bar since we already have a food bar why not to water barTwo I would like if you could add your own pictures from maybe your photos into the game and delete the old vanilla ones into new ones because I have gotcha backgrounds and I didn’t look at want to use them for backgrounds I wanted to use them for paintings third I would like it if you could place down stuff like food not just put item frames on the floor and Collett a day no I want you to place food and maybe other items because I saw on this video on Ld  shadow lady and fun crafts that you could play stuff down fourth I would like if you could add different breeds of dogs and cats I would like for cats if there was like are hairless cats that you can find in the desert kind of like Egypt kind of cats and for dogs I don’t just want to wolves I want like a French bulldog or something so please respond to this I really want these kind of stuff in the game peace out maybe,Love it just needs a few updates
5,2020-07-18 11:45:31,"Ever since my cousin introduced this game to me when I was little I’ve been playing this game. It’s hard to believe it was six or seven years ago I was introduced to Minecraft. When I started playing it was fun, and the updates Mojang have added are great, and the make the game so much more interesting. This has become an activity I can do with my family and friends, and it is super fun. My only complaint is one time my game glitches very and I mean very badly. It wouldn’t come off of the loading screen and I had to delete and  download the game. I lost all of my worlds, including some I made with my family that were super special. This happened a long time ago, (maybe a year or two at most) but I lost all of my worlds and I had to start over completely. I love having a Microsoft account that makes it really good for playing with friends and Minecraft has helped keep me and my friends in close contact. Overall, Minecraft is great, and I’m really glad I play it. Thanks!  I want to update this. I still love the game. Still 1,000,000 out of 5. I forgot to mention a couple things. Once when I played in the friends section it said one was playing. So I thought hey let’s go play with my friends. It was a stranger who didn’t friend. Ever.",Awesome
3,2019-09-17 18:05:40,"So great game hands down. It’s Minecraft. It’s obviously great. However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design.   1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.  2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend. Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.",Game Works When It Wants To
5,2021-05-04 15:48:31,So great game but I had this really cool world where I build this whole thing but then I got lost and couldn’t find my way back and now 8 am lost form it forever 😢 I don’t need you to fix my game but this has happened 2 times so can you make a save feature or an automatic save thing so that if you get lost you can reload back to your previous save because the save and quit button doesn’t have like a save file for before you saved it and left so if you add that I think me a others would have more fun still 5 stars though great game  Also for all the 1 star reviews ok first there is a difference between 1 star I don’t know how to change this in settings and 1 star I lost my account which one is actually important before you write one star look around the game and figure it out or do you want to go to all those ad filled games and complain some more about stuff that isn’t really important unless something happened like you lost your account don’t jump to 1 star if you need help In Settings just leave a 4 or 3 star review don’t just go to 1 star oh and for people who are scared of sounds go to settings and turn down the audio that’s all you have to do,One thing great game

Graphics on my console would be a huge thing to me because I’ve been playing since I was 4 years old and I have been able to gain lots of skills,  BUT!, it still is missing something and that would be the graphics.  The beauty of the shaders is better then anything,  and the water effects, the sun effects, and the shine, that would be cool,  especially when you said SOME of us where disappointed on the cancellation of the SDGP.  I’m sorry but all of us were disappointed and I would like you guys to make up for it.  It’s just that, you guys added the store, the custom skins, and the bee and nether update,  but the console will still be waiting for you guys,  I’m in 7th grade and Minecraft is a habit I have and it’s fun and I don’t care what people think about it,  WE just want what you guys promised us,  because you guys kept all of them but this one.

5,2019-06-03 02:50:31,"Literally no game could ever top Minecraft and it’s pure simplicity. It gives people an opportunity to be creative and do whatever they desire without people constantly trying to get their money or bombard your experience with ads! Granted you can pay for skins and cool adventure maps, but that’s besides the point. There is no “Pay to get to the nether” or “pay for this certain enchantment”, it’s pure gameplay. There is no set story, you get to make that story with each world you create. There’s a little something for everyone, whether you love to explore different biomes or mine the deepest parts of caves. Whether you want to build the biggest kingdom of all time, or simply have an animal farm. This game is for literally every person, which is why it makes it one of, if not the greatest game of all time. Let me not forget the music and how peaceful it is and how nostalgic it is. If you are considering buying this for little Timmy and are questioning it because of zombies and monsters, think again. That’s only a small part of this game with infinite possibilities. This gives you a chance to escape to a world that YOU create! It’s perfect for long car rides, or for playing with your friends. Get this game. You will never regret it.",Greatest game of all time

5,2020-05-30 01:41:08,"Good Game! Been playing for almost 5 or so years. One of my favorite things in it is the redstone. There’s one problem though: redstone dust, repeaters, and comparators are like one block. Therefore, they can’t fit under slabs. I would love to see them be able to count as half-blocks so they can fit under slabs. I would also like to see an item, similar to the structure block, but you can get it in survival, and it only places a layout of the structure that has been saved in it. So if you save, let’s say, a tree, then click load, it will only load transparent ghost blocks of the blocks that were being used. I would also like to see a command that can fill things, like chests. Maybe something like /fillitem [item] [amount]. Also one last thing, it would be amazing and very useful for named ender chests to only share the items that have the same name so multiple people on a world/server won’t have to put the same items in the same ender chest. Also, please make it so that ender chests can interact with furnaces. I don’t know if mojang or anyone who is somehow connected to anyone at mojang, but if they are, PLEASE add/ask Mojang to add these, or at least consider them.

Once I’m done with my mansion I’m gonna go on a bunch of adventures looking for some pretty hard stuff to find. I may try to defeat an ender dragon! But honestly creative mode is the BEST! You can express yourself so easily with friends!!! I bought this game with absolutely NO REGRETS! I really like building houses, visiting my friends, taking animals, and adventuring in mines, and beyond! Including the waters 🌊!!! I have this cute pink and purple skin and I ❤️ it so much!! I don’t have many minecons since I started about 4 months ago and plus I spend basically all my time in creative mode so I’m really looking forward to the minecon event. And if your still not interested, there’s an EDUCATIONAL MODE which I don’t use but you can if you want 😄over all I’m obsessed with this game and it’s totally worth the money!!! Also all of a sudden I can’t play with my friends? I set up my gamer tag even on the Xbox app but when I try to friend my bffs or they try to friend me it says I can’t friend people because of how my account is set up so me and my family were trying to fix it but it wouldn’t work! Please help! But even if I can’t play with my friends it’s really fun I just wished I could!",OMG
5,2019-06-03 02:17:09,"Minecraft is amazing! Absolutely fun and incredible and has always been my childhood game! There are so many ways to express your creativity and build so many things you wouldn’t be able to in real life! But I was wondering if you guys would soon add different dog skins as well, since Minecraft PE has different cat skins, but wolves only have one and many other players would enjoy it as well! This is only a request, so it’s perfectly fine if it can’t be developed into the game as I understand it takes a while to put new things into the game, but it would be very much appreciated if possible! It can give players new ideas for their pet shop, and expanding the pets in Minecraft as players are able to get a variety of different dogs rather then just one! Me and my friends would also very much appreciate it, as one of my friends love animals! She is so inspired playing Minecraft it gives her new ideas and a topic for us to talk about when it gets awkward ;^; This idea would be really cool and lots of players would probably definitely love it! ( like I mentioned though, if it currently isn’t possible to do, please don’t stress about it ) ❤️  -sincerely a Minecraft player :3",Was wondering if Minecraft PE can have different dog skins as well! •3•
5,2018-07-29 05:14:32,FRIST: l would really like if mojang added bears beavers dears squirrels ants and elephants.    Second: I would also like if mojang would add quick sand to make the quick sand u would need a bucket of water and place it on some sand and I would also like if there would be more dogs like huskys they would be found in the snow biome and and I would also like if there was a oven block wand a sink block with a water a effect and I would also like if there were a way to make your own skin in Minecraft         Third:  I would like if there were acid rain and a lighting rod were u could have a stick in your hand and during a lightning storm and then the stick would turn into a cool lightning rod then u can attack with lighting I would also like if mojang they added paint to paint the house we make and I would like if they added pirate boats and u can ride them and and put all of your diamonds and stuff in the pirate boat we would have to make the pirate boat with two black banners sticks wood and if they would add Dinosours and make a Dinosaur biome THANK YOU FOR READING I HOPE MY IDEAS GET IN THE GAME THX AND TO NEW PLAYERS OF MINECRAFT THIS IS THE BEST GAME U WILL EVER PLAY THANK YOU MOJANG FOR MAKING THIS GAME AND I HOPE U READY THIS AND MAKE MY IDEAS INTO THE GAME THX!!!!!! :D :) :) :D :D :D :D :D,Best game ever made but I would like to add some stuff
5,2021-06-23 22:00:59,"Ok so I have been playing this game for about 4 yrs and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! I know you (Mojang) are pretty busy with everything, but... I (And everyone else) WOULD LOVE NEW MOBS!!! And.... also, maybe some new types of dogs? I LOVE how there are multiple cats... but why not multiple different types of dogs??? I love the idea of most of the animals (like parrots, cats, uhhh.... I think that’s it) having different colors, but dogs (wolves) don’t... I’m not complaining (well... sort of) but I understand that you are busy. It would also be REALLY COOL and super helpful if you could like either make plates or make the bowls placeable. I have always wanted to place the food down on bowls/plates or even on the ground or tables but... ya can’t. I wrote about a year ago talking about how it would be nice if you could do other stuff to eggs than just throwing them, making cakes with them, and collecting them. I was thinking maybe add a feature where you can make a skillet or something like that out of iron which, technically you can just cooked an egg in the furnace!! And it could be like a “cooked egg” or a “scrambled egg”. Thank you so much for reading! Please take this into consideration on your spare time!!!",Best game but needs more animals!
5,2021-06-17 16:16:41,There’s been some problems with all these new updates they are terrible I dread every new update that comes out because it’s either more things I have to do to complete the game or just random crap that doesn’t need to be added I’ve been playing this game since the second it came out on pocket edition and they have changed it so much I’m just saying this new world textures is bull I'm so mad about it although it is the only video game I play still you guys need to change all the textures back and bring back old Samson and cod please please oh please I wouldn’t mind more swords and armor and I thought of a thing called a heart cage you can find them but they are rarer than enchanted apples and they give you an infinite heart whether you make it so you loose it when you die or not this would be a great idea thanks for the game just please oh please do what I said also lots oh people hate the new textures to I mean read the comments mojang but thanks for this game but oh yeah also please add the 1.9 combat update to bedrock I would play it so much more and buy more merch if you did and if you want to talk to me my Minecraft user name for both Java and bedrock is Nephenzepher okay thanks and fix it,Okay listen mojang
4,2022-12-25 21:05:46,"Quick issue: I cannot separate items in my inventory. I’ve tried many times and tried to fix it, but nothing worked. My friend says it works for her, so I’m not sure what the issue is. This greatly affects my gameplay. I’m assuming it’s from the newer updates that for some reason changed how you move stuff in your inventory. I personally hate it, and so does my friend. Also, when you take something out of a furnace after cooking/smelting it, you can’t interact with items in your inventory. Please change it back to the way it was. I used to be able to perfectly interact with my inventory, and now it’s extremely difficult. Also, there are multiple items I had (for character customization, mainly hats) before I got an account. I got an account, which kept my things, but once I signed out? Stuff was missing. I had many things I can no longer get back. I have yet to sign back into my account, but I mostly prefer playing outside of it, so this is really disappointing. Aside from these things, I love this game. I have never spent more time on any one game in my life, and I’ve played Minecraft since probably 6 years ago. It’s incredible, so continue the good work and please fix at least the first issue. 🤙","Great game, but a few issues"
5,2018-12-22 01:49:43,"I love this panda and stray cats update, it really cool but I would like to put some suggestions as my title says. So, first things first, I would love for you all to put in chairs, couches, tables, you name it from the PC! Because having chairs and couches made out of stairs, signs, and slabs is kind of boring to be honest. I would love it to have a few things like the PC has. Second, I would love for the stuff like skins and maps for it to be lowered like 50 coins less or 100 less because some of them are extremely expensive for you to buy the coins and purchase some although I know you need the money to make stuff along with patience and time, I understand. Third, I would love for you to add the animal ears and tails for PE because it would be so cool since I’m a meifwas, kitzune, werewolf/wolf, dragon, and more fantasy-like fan and I think others would like it to.     I know it would take a LOT of time for you all to make some of these suggestions to come true. Take all the time you need, I won’t mind because I have to have a bit of patience for something so I can be having more patience for other things to! Thank you for doing the panda and cat update!                       Have a great year! ~ Zoe  (Sorry if I spelled anything wrong.)",~Few Suggestions~
5,2018-01-06 02:30:16,"Plz take a moment to read this. I've been a fan of this game since I was like 8...back when it was just cows, pigs, sheep and chickens. I do like the recent updates, and not saying I for like them...but I do agree with the people on here that are saying all the problems with the bugs and the glitches. It has happened to me before, numerous times. After a while...it starts to really get on your nerves, that all your hard work and your items are all the sudden gone. I still have fun and enjoy playing this game with my buds and my sibling, but it's just almost not fun anymore when you know that there is the major risk that all the work you are doing in that world may potentially be erased the second you log out. I have had some pretty good memories with this game when I was younger, and I want other kids to be able to enjoy it without the annoyance of bugs/glitches, or the worry about the possibility that your work... Or even your world may be erased. I will give you a five star review because despite all the glitches & bugs... I still love the game. I'm just hoping that you can take the time to read over my opinion Mojang. Thank you for your time to all the people who have read this far. :)",Please Take A Moment To Read
4,2023-09-20 19:49:57,"I have played Minecraft for a long time. Ever since this update came (the one where you can now crawl not in Bella) I have saw many things happening. The first one being is when placing/breaking blocks I see some black shadow come up and go out of my screen. Two. I’m not sure if it’s me or the game but when I use a repeating command block and try to put in where to TP too it just won’t work. What I mean by this is even if I put in the position it won’t work. Then last one 3. I’m not sure how to crawl because I’m playing on IPhone and not computer. This is all I have of the problems but in my opinion, I think some new things should be added. The first one is putting back where you can tame ocelots. 2. Maybe make like task you have to do to get free minecoins because I just don’t think you should pay for it and have to pay for the game. 3. Maybe make like a group/website, put in names of peoples user name,spin a wheel and whoever it lands on they give ideas to put in Minecraft. 4. Like I said earlier, I also don’t think it’s right to make people buy the game, pay for minecoins, and now have to make a Microsoft account with it just to be able to join servers and play with friends. And 5. Make different kinds or types of wolves. This is all I have now and I really think everyone should play Minecraft of all age. Thank you for reading this :)",Why I put in a 4 star rating
5,2022-08-03 17:27:37,So first time I went into survival it was hard so I went into creative mode and I Spond frogs since you’re allowed to and a few days later I made a house yeah it was fun in a few days later I realize something that I can get commands so then I got a barrier block it was pretty fun this game is very good for probably 4+ or if you’re older than probably better and then I saw the cutest little thing it was a baby bunny in Minecraft guess what I did I hit it and then I got rabbit Leg which is supposedly very rare but I get rabbit leg a lot so it isn’t really rare just like the title says it’s hard on iPad but once you get used to it it gets so much easier so definitely probably go on a PC it’s probably much easier sorry that this is so long this is probably the best game ever so I recommend you playing this🤩🤩☺️ yes it is that good so definitely play this game it is literally the best I’m trying to figure out how to get mods🧐🧐so yeah sometimes it gets laggy in don’t be alarmed if when you like play a different game on your device and it really sets the world on Minecraft it’s probably just making sure that it isn’t laggy or there isn’t like any hackers or something like that so if you don’t want any random people joining then just go to settings I mean you probably can’t go to settings you have to like press the pencil and then you can press multiplayer and there you go dang this is long bye have a good day,It is a little hard on iPad  i recommend creative
5,2023-07-11 22:25:01,I wanted to play this game because my brother played it all the time and I fell in love with this game after a few days. It is definitely a must play and is really one of my favorite games ever and if there is a top 5 best games this game will make sense if its on there🥰 There is some bugs that I have noticed but not as many as some other games that I played. If you want to be a builder this game is for you but it is also about crafting and fighting that is not that hard and it is really fun if you do creative and not as fun if you do survival but it is still fun! Also has rules for your first time like don’t dig straight down there might be lava under you don’t place a bed in the neither and end dimensions because it will explode and if you have a lot of stuff in survival mode don’t let a monster kill you because your stuff will fall out ( but it won’t fall out when you load your world and put the no falling out stuff when you die mode on.) And extra ones like don’t look into a endermen’s eyes (the endermen are the black monsters with purple eyes) and if you do it will get mad and try to kill you and don’t activate the skull sencers in the caves and if you do ( by making loud noises) the warden will spawn and try to elemenate you and watch out because it does lots of damage. And that was some stuff and tips that you now know about Minecraft and it is worth to play!,should be in the top 5 best games
5,2022-06-03 23:17:24,"I was in the App Store looking for another app till I saw this game,Minecraft. I have heard of it before,some people say it’s a awesome game so,I downloaded it! And just like other poeple said. ITS AWESOME!!!!! Usually I used to have it on easy and not noticing I can change the game mode. I was really scared of the lava,spiders,monsters, and the skeletons I hated them I couldn’t fight them! ☹️🙁 And how I learned I can change the game mode is when a spider fell on my face! 🕷😱😱😱 I can also spawn animals which I like to do that so I can tame animals like wolves and cats also pandas I love when I can feed the pandas it’s adorable if u wanna tame a cat use raw fish 🐟🤢🤢🤢 anyways sorry if this review is to long but if u have read this review u should totally download this!! Bai! :EDIT: This game is awesome like me from 5 years ago said!! ^^ Anyways,just 1 thing…for some reason when I hopped on Minecraft inside the game I was signed out and I couldn’t log in!! So I have no idea if I was hacked or something went wrong with minecraft or my tablet (maybe it was my tablet it was like made 7 years ago-) but I don’t know I’ll see if I can try to fix these..but please send me some information that could possibly help me get my account back!!

5,2023-10-08 07:18:41,I used to think that to play this game you needed friends and if you started a world it would force you to play with other people you didn’t know… that is not true! It’s very good game it good if you have friends it a good game if you don’t it’s a good game if you wanna play with people and it’s a good game if you don’t… it’s good for if you like parkour if you like bonding with people over jokes in the mines it’s a good game if you like participating in challenges it’s a good game if you like making a dream perfect house for your pets and yourself (and maybe friends if you’re feeling nice that day) it’s a good game if you like farming it’s a good game if you like telling stories through books and mysteries it’s a good game if you like building towns and family’s that don’t really exist it’s a good game if you like re-creating things in the real world and spending so much time on it (with or without help from other people) then look at it and just feel great that you made that it’s a good game if you like survival games where you can build an honest life (again with or without other people) it also has lovely music that I like listening to even when I’m not playing the game also the animals in the game are very cool and their still adding more to be amazed by!

5,2022-08-07 23:05:39,"You must play this game. Why? Well, I have played Minecraft for over 6 years now and it’s great. You can play in creative if you are more of the builder, and doesn’t want mobs creeping up and killing you. But you can also play survival where you try not to die and fight your way to the end to kill the dragon steal the egg, then go home to your beautiful base or moving house to kill the wither to make a beacon. Or you can just have fun explore and play. You can be very creative in this game and creative cool inventions using Redstone. This game is very cool and you should try it out if you don’t like it then I’m sorry. In Minecraft you can install mods or make your own mods to go into the game! You can play with your friends and family and have a fun time! All the while trying not to die if you are in survival. In creative you have all the blocks you need! And there’s different “levels” or like types of how you want your game to be if you are a beginner and think that being on normal mode is to are you can go to easy mode, or if you think that normal it too easy you can go to hard mode! You can make the world to your pleasure and and even play on a server with other people. There is also a market place if you want to share your creativity with other people. But you should really get this game and try it out. Peace out hope you have fun. ✌️","Read me, b/c you must play this game. °v°"
5,2022-06-18 04:02:25,"I love the game, which is why I gave it 5 stars, but there’s this mod I want to talk about. So I already put a one star review on that mod, but I want to say this by review unless I can do it by email. *Inhale* so basically theres a mod in your marketplace that rips you off. (Im not going to say scam because the mod is free but it now takes up my space.) the mod is named Axolotl Islands: Slime Machines made by Tetrascape. I downloaded it because it seemed pretty cool (and also because I adore axolotls, I mean who doesn’t?!), the game wants you to find out how to work it yourself, it doesn’t even tell you what to do in the game or the description!! All you do in the mod is walk around and try to get through portals and look at axolotls in the middle of nowhere. A green arrow is above one of the axolotls, (the yellow and pink one) so I supposed I have to talk to it. There was no button that let me talk to it. The game is basically broken. Since the developer put you in creative mode I looked at the menu to see what items there are not knowing what I was doing, I thought I found something that would open the portals but nothing. The pictures of the game show that there are different islands you can go to, I looked around for an hour trying to find an island. Nothing. Nada. Tetrascape obviously did a terrible job on the mod and now takes up my storage. Thanks a lot.",Basically theres a mod that scams you
5,2020-01-02 20:24:41,"I’ve been playing Minecraft PE since 2011 and it’s awesome! But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let’s say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don’t know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it’s basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star’s second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can’t stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn’t do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do.",Weird custom skin glitch
5,2020-08-03 08:16:47,"Hi. So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It’s ultimately a great game. Here’s some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don’t need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone’s been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That’s all my requests for now. Thank you!",Addicted to this game!
5,2022-07-06 04:36:39,Minecraft PC is already good at this game just amplifies it and this game has some features that are not really NPC obviously most of the PC players after you get the updates faster but like you do when the update came out it’s already coming to my Ted walk I love you it’s a really good game all the updates keep you on your toes and if they’re saying besides the time that they had babies the size double like a Debbies but we can just blame that on my gang that’s all I absolutely love this game this game is probably one of the best to come out probably lost probably 2010 I don’t hold out with all the updates Worth that will be coming also I would like to suggest that the next update should be the end of August and then there would be a new type of armor and then that would be the last armor set in Minecraft also Minecraft does get a little boring at times like when they had bees update and we should probably get another realm even though you guys said that you were never put in another realm we need more roams like maybe like one more also there’s always a layout for one the one in the agency may make the make up you can like the portal when you get to an agency and then in there might be like some really good loot possibly even like nether right armor this is the best game download it now,The best mobile game of all time
5,2021-03-21 18:46:50,"I recall my days as a child in elementary school when this game first gained popularity. All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang. Thank you for changing my life.",A lifelong friend
5,2020-09-04 21:43:18,"Ok, I have been playing Minecraft for years. Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won’t unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the “loading terrain” screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Whenever I want to play a fun game, this will always be my first choice. With the endless building ideas, the challenge of defeating the bosses, and playing countless games and tests Minecraft is the best game out there and will make you play for hours.  A few animal ideas are: Bears, birds, snakes, frogs, mice, sharks, squirrel, elephant, lion, monkey, butterfly, crab, deer, penguin, kangaroo, koala, raccoon, alligator or crocodile and more types of dogs.

5,2020-01-18 20:43:32,"(Keep in mind, this is the mobile version, PE) It’s such a great game and I love it, but recently it’s been getting more buggy than ever. A few glitches that I have experienced that get very annoying are things such as, when a friend joins, I’ll be wearing their skin, and they’ll be wearing mine (in their POV). It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I’ll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot. Keep in mind, I’ve tried everything. I’ve deleted tons of apps, cleared data from things, just to make sure that I have space on my device (and it’s not that). The most recent glitch for me, however, (which is why I’m writing this) doesn’t even let me into the game. I’ve tried purging all my apps again to clear even more space and I don’t know what else to do. It gets to the last couple of bars in the loading screen and freezes. It doesn’t kick me out, just freezes on that and won’t go into the game. I’m becoming impatient, waiting for it to go into the game and it still won’t. I swipe up the app then go on it again, only for the same result, over and over. No matter how many apps I’ve had before, it’s never done this and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to delete the app for fear of losing all my data and worlds. Anyone have any suggestions??",Great! But it won’t let me even open it.
5,2021-08-06 21:47:22,OK I love Minecraft and I know a really cool update that we should have I heard there was probably gonna be an update for Christmas so I thought it would be a great idea to.... have the update and be like seasonal so for Halloween you would get Halloween decorations and our Halloween stuff and then for Christmas we get Christmas stuff for Valentines you’ll get valentines stuff and everything could be celebrated I think that would be really cool and I can make Minecraft epic like I can’t wait for Christmas those items would be epic and then you could add them as real items to be there forever I think it would make it where everyone’s server would be really cool and more people would want to play and another update we should do is like furniture we could have a bit of furniture like regular furniture nothing too special we just want regular furniture that would be really cool so then everyone would actually be able to make couches and people could sit in their beds instead of having to put my cards in their beds and it’s really hard to do that stuff because it’s just like hard because when it gets messed up or your pets get it you can’t get them out unless you get rid of it and you have to restart your whole bed for couches I don’t know how to sit on them and it will be really boring if you can’t sit on your couch,New updates
5,2021-03-01 02:16:02,"Hi! I just thought of a few new mobs I would like for the developers to add into Minecraft! I hope they at least add in one of them. 1. Skele-Fish. It is a fish that can be found in all water sources in every biome, except for swamps. It can only spawn in when the world is in easy, normal, or hard. It can drop up to 3 bones when killed, it doesn’t attack you unless if you attack it first,  (just like when you hit a wolf in survival when it isn’t tamed to anyone in that world) it deals three hearts when it attacks you, and it has a body made of bones with no eyes. 2. Black Bear. A bear with a brown snout, brown belly, and all the rest is black fur. It can only be found in Taiga (spruce forest) biomes. It has the same body that the polar bear does. It eats raw fish of any type and sweet berries, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them (just like the foxes). They can spawn when the world is in peaceful, easy, normal, or hard. But when it is peaceful, when you attack them they won’t attack you back. But when it isn’t in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival. 3. Penguin. It only spawns in snowy plains and on icebergs. They eat raw fish of any type, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them. They have a white belly and the rest is all-black. They do not attack you when you hit them in easy, normal, or hard.",A few new mobs I would like to be in Minecraft
5,2022-07-02 16:53:36,"Ok I love Minecraft and there are some things that would be better, and or cool but I know this’ll get buried but still. With the wild update there was a “portal” in the ancient city and that’s so cool and I know how long it takes to build things like that because I build things like mansions a lot and it takes days, months, sometimes even years to finish because you may not be motivated enough. But I know there is more than one person on the building team. And I think (like many others) that it would be super cool to add a actual portal into the “ancient dimension” where there is a “warden king” or warden queen depending on the gender or just “warden god.” There would be trees and things like that and it would just look so nice and cute. The trees would be called (in my mind) wisteria trees and they would have purple, blue, yellow, and pink leaves. They would have those same colours as their leaves or just types of blue considering the wardens colours. There would also be ores but I don’t know what to call them. But the other thing is end ores too I don’t know what they would be called. I think it would be cool make them the same durability as netherite or more durability than netherite. That’s all for now I think this new update is so cool but it needs something more. Just thoughts to be honest nothing bad, just suggestions.",Love the game but…
5,2021-01-20 14:55:58,"Minecraft is one of my all-time favorite games to play! I love seeing all of the different updates that are added. Recently, I went at least 2 months without playing which really sucked (STAY IN SCHOOL KIDS) but when I did return to my Minecraft world, there was so much new stuff waiting for me to explore! I think survival is a fun mode if you’re up for a challenge. Then there are people like me. I start with creative and build everything I want (sometimes I get lucky and find a village) and stock up on everything. I mean EVERYTHING. From food to blocks to animals to weapons, I never want to be caught by a monster in survival without the proper weapon! The villagers are really fun to trade with. When I play Minecraft, I listen to the sound on my airpods and I love the noise that villagers make! I recently made a new world titled “Covid is killing my brain cells” where I used everything from the inventory. I have my own little zoo and a very enforced prison where I keep the monsters. Ok I didn’t use EVERYTHING. I didn’t use endermans because (1) they scare the heck out of me and (2) they could just teleport out of their prison cell and murder me ruthlessly in my sleep. I have an aquarium too with all the sea animals. Whoever thought to add dolphins is my new best friend! So what I’m trying to say is that I absolutely love Minecraft and would recommend it to everyone! ❤️",I love love love Minecraft!
5,2020-12-18 03:33:29,This is my fav game In my opinion there is not any other game that is better but I want to put a big thing I want as an update pls!! I love baby villagers I want the creater of minecraft to put a thing in the settings button that says something like any villager you want can turn into a baby forever. And that if you feed the baby’s potato’s they will be your kid so you can play roleplay where they act like real life babys like when they want something to get or some milk to drink they will cry and things but there should be a button on that in settings so you can turn it on and off or that if you click on the villagers you can pick things like this villager play as I baby in roleplay or I follows you and a button that says learn on him where you teach them to talk and walk and crawl. I am sorry that this is sooooo long but I want to be able to love baby villagers and keep them as babys and be there mom. I would also like if you could like if you eat something that you can find in villages and in timpels that if you eat it you have a big belly and one night you have a baby villager and you have to be it’s mom. But only add it for there is a button where you can switch it on and off. Sorry this is long pls respond back pls pls pls I really recommend getting this app it is the best EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER and a thousand more EVERS!lol!!😂sorry it is long bye get the app,Suggestions
5,2019-09-16 01:18:31,"I love Minecraft! I’ve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it’s come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It’s stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It’s a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn’t let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the “how to”, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won’t be able to stop playing! Trust me, you won’t regret getting it!!!💕💕",Minecraft is an amazing game!!💕💕
5,2021-07-21 00:55:10,"I started playing this when I was like eight on my iPad and I LOVED it. I would be playing almost all day and build the most complex things! I still love it today and play it on a regular basis, but it’s just so cool that you can build anything you want! You can make sliding glass doors, get behavior packs so you can ride dragons, play on different worlds, and even invite your friends to join you! Another cool thing about it is that you can play on creative, adventure, or survival! In creative you can freely get blocks out of the inventory with out mining or crafting them, and you also can fly without elytra, don’t have to eat, and can last indefinitely underwater! Then in survival, you get to fight of mobs, go mining, and maybe find elytra so you can glide instead of walking or riding a horse! (Idk what adventure setting is tho 🤷🏼‍♀️) you can also go to the marketplace and by texture packs, different outfits and items, and even pre-made worlds!(one of my favorites is a snowboarding one) also, although some people seem to have glitches and stuff, I’ve never had any problems playing, and have never encountered a bug of any kind or a glitch! I’m just saying that if your undecided about wether or not to get it, it’s worth every penny and you won’t regret it!  -Someone who is obsessed with Minecraft  👁❤️⛏🧵",✨✨I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH! ✨✨
4,2020-05-30 02:34:27,"I love this game it’s like so much fun, but I would love it more if we had some new animals like black bears frogs, owls, cougars, rams for the mountains, like think 🤔 about it we have all these mountains but no rams. Also we have dolphins but no sharks 🦈 we zero animals in the savanna I would love to see a elephants and some giraffes, zebras and snakes would be awesome 😎 like I would definitely rate this game five stars but I really want to see more animals also whales would be 👍 great . Sorry if I’m ranting on about the animals, also how cool would it be if you could spawn a butler and maid 🤩  I would love it because I love to make huge houses but I can’t really guard my home and cook food myself I REALLY THINK IT WOULD BE EPIC IF YOU GUYS ADDED NEW ANIMALS AND NEW SPAWNS🤩 and I don’t mean like a custom pack I mean like in creative you have those egg like things and u can spawn anything you want , speaking of eggs I think it would be awesome if we had popcorn, snow cones  and pancakes 🥞.  Also can we please, please have spawn children I need a little kid running and causing chaos around my house, I’m a only child so I really want a sis and bro 😔🥺 and to get a kid! I had to spawn twelve different villagers just to get one kid!   Also a friend of mine is blind so he can’t really build a house we have to FaceTime with his bro to help him so could we get spawn houses too please for my bff. Thx 4 your awesome 👏🏻😎 game and stay safe ✌🏻",Can we plz get new animals
5,2020-07-08 15:04:33,"Mojang, thank you so much for making the best game this planet has ever seen. I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I’ve been hooked ever since. I’ve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I’m so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don’t want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don’t massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don’t realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it’s simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn’t want a cave update, but I just don’t want Minecraft to become something else.   I’m sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I’ve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don’t strip Minecraft’s simplicity from it. This is the game we grew up on, please don’t make it a different game. Thank you, and have a great day.",An Honest Opinion
5,2020-09-18 18:06:58,Minecraft is like the best game ever you can play with friend play severs and do all that you can make whatever you want in your builds. You can even add mods but there’s something that I don’t like only one thing and it’s the I used to be a mobile player I still am but I play more on my xbox it is that I can’t get any mobs on my phone that seem to work I really wanted the kitchen mod but when I downloaded it nothing poped up it could be the app that I’m getting it from bet oh well what would be a really cool update would be sharks but I don’t think we can get them and it would be cool if MOJANG could at a icon that you can click on to take you to a website or something to simply download a mod or texture packs like that would be awsome I also have some ideals that could possibly be added like maybe more foods or like more pets like a dog update the dogs not worlds dogs that have cool skins like big dogs and small dogs 🐕 🐶 like that would be so cool that’s all but Minecraft is a awsome game and you can Choos it you wanna go in a game by yourself or with your friends or with people you don’t know in a sever and the best thing is you and find treasure is a ship and a jungle temple and a desert 🐫 🐪 temple and others and you get really good loot and MOJANG if your seeing this do you think you could add these mods???? Well I got to go I recommend getting this app!!!!😍😍😍😍,BEST GAME EVER
5,2020-12-04 02:04:38,"I don’t have long to write a review, but this game is amazing. I started playing from around age 6 and have enjoyed playing this game for 6 years. Even though I feel I’ve only gotten decent recently I think this game is really fun. Not matter your trying to survive the night with your friends in survival, or building the mansion of your dreams in creative, best game ive ever played and has sculpted me as a gamer and in real life from the way I think of architecture and design. I can still remember being scared out my socks when I was only a kindle fire and it was day in the desert, and I went into a cave, then it was pitch black, I started to spin, and then I was lost. No escape. I was in survival for the first time which made it worse. Then Im spinning trying to see a light going deeper and deeper and BOOM! Got blown up by a creeper, let’s say I stuck to creative for a bit lol 😂. I love going on the MC discord and looking at all the amazing feedback I get from other players now that I have some actual good idea of what I’m doing and I’m trying to figure out redstone. One thing I would suggest, stop advertising the game as a game for little kids because even though I’m a kid I know when I’m an adult if you keep updating I’ll still be playing! But great job mojang otherwise! Woah this was a lot longer than I anticipated. Keep up the great work! -Conor",A creative masterpiece
5,2021-12-12 00:14:56,"I have played Minecraft since 2014 and I’ve loved it. They is only 2 problems and a few things I would like to be added. My 2 problems are, it sometimes glitches if I have a lot of flowers around? I’m not sure why it does this it’s kinda weird but it’s fine, my next problem is it kicks me off for no reasons once in a while, my wifi, networks, and everything else is fine but it still does it. Now on to the things I would like to add! I would like a unknown biom, what’s in it you ask? Well it has strange builds that are colorful but can be deadly but you can also find looted chest that have really good things. Another thing I would like to be added is new mobs, like whales, bears, fennec Fox’s, zombie/skeleton fish. I think those would be really good mobs. So the whales would drop whale meat which gives you speed while in water just like the dolphins but for a longer time and only when killed, the bears would drop fur which can be crafted into a rug or drop hunny, the fennec Fox would drop bug meat and when you get close they would give you speed in the desert, and the Zombie/Skeleton fish would drop fish flesh if were zombie or 2/3 bones if skeleton when killed but can attempt to attack if frightened. I hope you can fix those problems and add those things!!      And keep up the good work!  18.2",L.O.V.E
5,2020-04-02 14:53:17,"Minecraft is truly an amazing game. Reason being, how it really makes you wonder about life’s unexplored lore, and a bunch of possibilities that may come across you in the future. I recently beat the ender dragon in the bedrock version, so I decided I wanted to to stay at the credits screen and read it all the way. Which actually happened. The way the credits screen was written out really had me speechless just because of how simply powerful the language makes you imagine about life, and imagining how far you may go.  I never really thought about life that deep before, when I was still very young, but now that a few years have passed, I definitely have developed a drastically deeper understanding for Minecraft. I believe that Minecraft just isn’t a sandbox game where you can let your imagination and creativity raise the bar as high as you want, but I honestly think it’s more than just a game. The credits screen feels like you’re living a dream come true, which I feel like it’s more than just a game. This is why I’ve been sticking with Minecraft ever since the past decade, and would definitely recommend this game to anyone that is into video games. If anyone actually read this all the way until the bottom, thank you for reading. If you just started Minecraft, keep playing, you won’t regret it one bit. 😇","Thank you, Minecraft"
5,2019-07-03 11:05:13,"This game is the best game I’ve ever played in my life. It helped me when I had to get surgery. It helps me when I get home from school. Hands down this is the best game ever, and if you’re reading this you should definitely get it. It has structures to explore, over 30 biomes, achievements to get, about 85, you can playin friends worlds, in your own worlds, and if you sign in to Xbox live you can pay on servers with players across the globe. You can play worlds in survival or creative, with cheats on or off. The 5 default servers are The Hive, Lifeboat, Mineplex, Mineville City, and Cubecraft games. But there are tons of other servers around too. It constantly updates proving it won’t go out of business for a whiiiiiiiiiiile. If you’re looking for an awesome game, get Minecraft.  Suggestion: 	Maybe in the create world slot you could add more textures and not just the default. You could add past tense, or future tense, or Realistic Minecraft, whatever you want. And possibly, could you eventually add more bosses. Knowing the fact when you beat the Wither and Ender Dragon, there’s not really anything else to do. Really you could just go to end city, get achievements, that’s really all that’s important left. And maybe you could add some guns in the game. There’s only a bow and crossbow, maybe you could have an AK-47, or a Sniper Rifle, really anything just please add guns.",Love. It.

5,2020-03-26 17:16:06,"Many can agree that this is the app we grew up on. This app is amazing, along with its beautiful, tear-bringing soundtrack. As I look back on the app, it has changed so much. It sounds crazy, but I almost wish it was back to the days when you lived off of cows and used boats, but now it’s all cheats and crazy builds and bees. But my favorite part has to be the soundtrack. Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don’t even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us. I know this is long, but this game is so worth it. Great job, Mojang, and Notch, and all the others. You have created history.",Minecraft
5,2020-12-17 17:00:48,"So I love Minecraft. I’m obsessed with hardcore survival through never ending creative builds. I love the nether and the end. I hope the end gets updated but that is not what I am here for. 1st of, I want to make a whole new type of Minecraft world called service. This would be a pre-server world so that you can put the build in there into a server without the whole “24 7 hour update that I waste my day on.” 2nd, I want to make a new land called “the fade.” This area would be all faded. But it wasn’t always that way... if you find and defeat the forden (A small mob that is is visible but will fade if you look at it.) If you find the power source that causes this mob to fade you cow destroy it. That mob will drop something called the Fax enchantment to gloves (which y’all should add too) and you touch something the whole world will spring with life. Then a door will appear out of no where to take you back to the over world when you are ready. This will also contain Force oars and on and on. 3rd, A time traveler. If you kill a wither, enderdragon, and forden, they will drop something called Broken map. If you place the three pieces together it will unlock something called a time traveler. This can take you to places from When those shipwrecks weren’t shipwrecks to when the villagers actually LIKED diamonds. Thanks for reading!",I can make this game better
4,2021-03-22 17:44:52,"I want to prefece thsi by saying I love this game and always have I’ve been playing Minecraft for year and it’s only gotten better. Except there are many issues that have caused me grief, one being crashing if I leave the game and come back to it it kicks me off my world and nothing will work until I close the app and reopen it. Also realms is fun but many issues one being whenever I want to put kne of my own worlds on my realm it says error and won’t cooperate I’ve found ways to get around this but still it’s unnecessary also you can’t change much about your realm once it’s made like game setting such as fire spreads and more, however I do apretiate the fact that there is automatic backups of your world constantly so you don’t lose everything. Another issue is people getting kicked from the game when they are already in it just kicks them off for no reason that it says  But besides crashing this game is so much fun there  isn’t a day when I play this I don’t enjoy besides when it crashes. Also I have the newest iPhone the 12 pro max and have these issues but my close friend with an 8 plus can’t even launch the game without it crashing, and I can’t access marketplace nothing will load and my work is decent nothing will load and I can’t make purchases besides these issues I live this game and it’s worth the money 100%",Such a good game but some issues
5,2020-05-12 21:54:47,"Minecraft is the best game ever! It has so much do to. Fight off mobs with weapons, or build a horn your own creative way. Make farms for food, enchant your weapons, and explore villages. There is so much more to do! I’ve played this since I was 4 years old and I still do! It’s AWESOME! If people hate on Minecraft, then I’m very disappointed in them. Minecraft is a one of a kind game with so much potential that it has already given us. More cool ideas can always be added. It has an awesome community, lots of servers and cool mods, and even has cool stuff like Minecon for you to look forward to. Because of COVID19, this year’s Minecon might be cancelled. I really hope not. Anyways, that is off topic to this review. I have so many good experiences playing Minecraft. I can remember worlds that me and my cousins would play in. We would build hotels and make our own parkour courses. We tested out with redefine and command blocks, too. Seriously, games like Fortnite have NOTHING against Minecraft! I’m always gonna be a Minecraft fan. I can’t wait for the new nether update coming! It’s advanced the nether A LOT! It’s just awesome! Plus, Minecraft puts out 2 big awesome updates a year. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend Minecraft. Not scary, not boring, it’s VERY fun, even if your not a gamer, there is a 99.9% chance you are going to love it!

5,2023-05-22 16:45:33,Hello There! I’m a minecraft veteran playing for almost 11 years I’ve been experiencing minecraft for alot of years now and All i recommend To add is a new structure or biome in the ocean Since the aquarium Update came out it has been years the ocean is boring now I really like if you add new things to the ocean it’s useless now And also It could be cool if you add a new structure to the end to Like “Place Of the boss of The Nether” it could be cool if you add a mob In the nether that is boss of every mobs in the nether and owns the nether Also Few bugs I noticed since the Villager and pillager update came out some stuff I noticed is that sometimes when the villagers are sleeping there are on the ground? Like this is so strange it gives creepy vibes and I hope you Could add a new ore everyone has been dying for a new ore and we really need To Get torches in our other hands it’s so useful like Java People will be happy if you add it to bedrock edition to as a feature I hope you see this Developer! I appreciate Your company and Workers Minecraft Over the years you’ve done such a work I have been playing since it came out! I hope you could listen to the community Because some of these are valid and deserved to add! Have a good day or a good night hopefully,Minecraft veteran For 11 years but got some Realization

5,2020-07-10 20:04:06,This game is so fun! I love all of the updates and in my opinion the new update every one is complaining about is actually really good! But besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore. So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn’t think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn’t have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn’t working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‘Blackstone’? I didn’t even know that existed in the game! A lot other glitches have been happening I just can’t think of all of them right now. Those glitches stood out to me the most. Overall really good game!,I LOVE THIS GAME SM
5,2023-04-27 20:10:43,"Hi Mojang! Sorry for my hate reviews on this game. I was just upset that all my progress was deleted. I hope you can forgive me. I have some suggestions for your community mob votes and some useful information. Back in 2020, the glow squid won unfairly. A Minecraft YouTuber, Dream, convinced all of his viewers to vote on the glow squid. He was very popular and the glow squid only won because of him. I have nothing against dream I’m just saying that he rigged the 2020 mob vote. A lot of people (including me) wanted the other two mobs to win. So to make it fair, please add in the moobloom and iceologer. They looked super cool, and I’m sure no one would mind. Besides, we need more naturally spawning passive fantasy mobs in the overworld, so the moobloom would be neat. I have a few suggestions. Don’t make the mob votes so late. A lot of people can only do this stuff in the day. Don’t host votes on apps like twitter or discord. Only host them on servers. Also, please add the mobs that lost. Lots of us wanted those mobs, and the fans of the winning mob will get to keep their mob, to. Win-win. Finally, make more options for mobs in mob votes. We should have 5-6 mobs to choose from. Once again I apologize for my hate reviews…I really do like Minecraft. I got it on my computer so now I can play it without having to deal with the controls. Bye!",Hi!

I checked a million times to see if it’s just a update or something like that but it’s not! It’s super glitchy too, me and my cousins usually play together but it’s been lagging a lot. Then randomly it kicks you out and doesn’t let you join back in unless you reset the whole thing. You guys say that you keep fixing the game- but your not, your making it worse. We love that you are adding new things to the game and I’m not saying that’s the problem...but maybe...it is? I’m so excited for all the new things! Don’t get me wrong, everyone is! But there was a few I didn’t like personally. It was the customize your own skin thing you guys added not to long ago. We are happy that you tried to make the game better, except I really think you made it worse. That’s might just be me but I loved the game where we didn’t have all this glitchy stuff and we can play without that. And without that confusing customize your own skin thing. Please fix it! This is the game I love and will always love- but just remove some of the updates you think made the game better. Thank you!!!",OMG I LOVE THIS GAME- but...
5,2020-03-17 22:23:30,"I’ve been playing Minecraft since I was 7. It’s one of my favorite games to this day and I still love playing it. But I still have a few things I really want added to the game. Backpacks would be an extremely helpful feature to add to the game. On long adventures I’ve run out of space in my inventory many times. Backpacks would help solve this problem. I’ve tried to download mods for backpacks but they never work. Flying creatures such as dragons that you can ride on would be so much fun. It’s a bit of a stretch considering the only dragon in the game is the ender dragon but honestly it would be a lot of fun. Instead of having them spawn randomly maybe it can be a quest to find a dragon egg and then have some specific way to hatch it. My last suggestion is different kinds of dogs. Cats come in 11 different kinds and I would be overjoyed if dogs did too. Maybe instead of taming wolves, dogs can be separate just like cats and ocelots. Preferably I would love breeds like pugs, collies, German shepherds, huskies, corgis, golden retrievers, poodles and bulldogs. Since dog breeds all vary in sizes I would suggest making them different sizes as well. I love what mojang has done over the years with the game and I hope these suggestions will come into consideration, please and thank you.",Minecraft is amazing but it definitely needs a few updates
4,2019-04-19 17:56:06,"Okay this game is amazing. We all know that. Though I think it can be better. I’ve played Minecraft all my life, it was the only game I grew up with. It’s become a part of my life and I can’t let it go. Therefore, I come from a period of Minecraft that was simple and didn’t have much to it. Which was what I loved about it. It stood out from Call of Duty and Halo. The only reason I won’t rate it a perfect 5/5 is because of one reason. This game has become too much. Don’t get me wrong, I love this game so much to stop playing. Although, I miss it being simple and not having so many mechanics... Back to when it was a simple game, just blocks, a few things. The amazing feel of inviting your friend that was right next to you into your world, just so you guys could goof off and build some awful world. That’s what made the game special. Now this game updates faster than half of the other Minecraft versions. It’s basically Minecraft Java, but mobile. I hate it. It doesn’t have that same feeling. Though, like said before, it’s not like I can just let this game go. So I’m still here playing it. I just wish that it was more how it was before. Before minecoins, the xbox live sign in, the new blocks that don’t even have a purpose. Just let me play the old Minecraft... the Minecraft I remember... the Minecraft I fell in love with... the Minecraft I stayed up for.  - TheOneReview.",That one review...
4,2023-05-28 21:26:01,"Okay, I just want to say that Minecraft is an amazing game. But, when I was playing with my friend in a world and we were making a city, when i left a building i made, there was thunder and lightning but no rain. I get scared a lot but I knew it was a sign of Herobrine I told my friend to leave immediately and I did. But my friend said that the game said, “You cannot do this right now.” When he pressed save and quit. He had to stay in the game and then he literally saw me in the game when i wasn’t and he said that i had white eyes and I was just staring at him. I wasn’t even in the game when he said that I was there with white eyes. It creeped us out so much. And i get scared super easily. Then the game started making all of the mobs float up into the air, even the NPCs we made and they all fell down and died. Then my friend saw a whole bunch of skeletons and slimes and the world was on peaceful. Then and only then was when my friend was able to leave the world. Then he decided to make a copy of the world just in case. After that all of his battery went out on his Xbox and on his iPad at the same time. I’m just informing you about this because we worked really hard on the world. And i got super scared 😟 and it got him scared too. I’m also informing you about this because it might help you catch him.","This is such a good game, but i encountered Herobrine"
5,2023-09-02 00:13:04,"I love Minecraft! Ever since my older sister introduced me into it all the way back in August 2020, I have been very addicted to this game! Sure, updates do take long, but don't blame Mojang! They are trying their best to satisfy us. So why don't we just take a moment to appreciate Minecraft? For all you good-rating people out there, keep being awesome to motivate and give happiness to this game and Mojang! 😇😇😇 That's all I wanted to say, goodbye! P.S, (Developer Message only) You guys are the best people on the Earth to make this game! You guys made popularity in only 3 years, going from less than 1,000 to over 50 million people! I think you guys deserve a round of applause and take a break, it's really hard to develop! I'm one of the people who try to help people with their emotions. Thank you Mojang for this wonderful game!! :)  [Edit]  My only suggestion/reminder (for Mojang only) is the servers. When I played a very popular yet unofficial Minecraft server, it kicked me out 2 hours later because of an unknown reason. It said I had to wait 2 hours until I could join again, but I've been working on it for a year and it still says the same problem! Please work on it Mojang, it is very, very annoying. (Just to let you know, the server is called Peaceful Vanilla Minecraft Server)",Best.. Game.. EVER!!!
4,2020-07-03 00:41:42,"I love Minecraft and have playing since it was on the Xbox 360, and I have loved everything about it! But recently it’s been laggy, glitchy and it even crashes when I try to play. Normally the game isn’t that slow but when ever I’m not on WiFi or have a poor connection , it takes 5 minutes to just to make the type of world that I want! Before the game would be a little slower than normal, but never THAT slow. I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash! And oddly enough when I try to pause the games it would take over 5 minutes for it to load the menu. Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection. The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers. The game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition. And the in-game shop has a few free skins, worlds and has deals that are often good. However, when there isn’t a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won’t have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins.   TL;DR Good game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates. Has some bad glitches but bearable.",On a scale of 1-10 it would be a 8
5,2019-03-23 21:29:50,"I’ve loved this game since I was really young. It is such a great way to be creative in more ways than just “placing blocks.” You can use math, science, art, architecture, music, and so much more in this incredible app. There are literally endless possibilities, and with the new updates, 2019 could quite possibly be its best year yet. My only problem is when it comes to texture packs, the really large and quite amazing ones like VanillaBDCraft don’t work on my phone. They cause the whole app to crash. I’m not sure if it’s a bug, but other than that, I have no problems with the game. The only other thing I wish would be changed is the variety of blocks. You have slabs, staircases, and full blocks, but there aren’t any smaller cubes aside from heads and you can’t have sideways slabs or staircases. I think this is a hug limitation in what is possible for art and architecture in Minecraft. With it, there could be so many more possibilities and overall efficient and better-looking builds. And don’t get me started on the Minecraft Store. That thing just gets on my nerves. Why is the most expensive texture pack in the store so simple? And the description of it isn’t professional at all. Other than these things, I have no problem with Minecraft and enjoy playing pretty much everyday.","Infinite Wonders, Endless Possibilities"
5,2018-01-24 00:04:05,"Look, I appreciate Minecraft so much. I feel like it has been reading my reviews (on different accounts). I ask for enderpearls, stained glass, etc and they ALL add to Minecraft pe in order. So, here’s two more things that I need last. One being shields and number two being capes. We had capes for a while, but then it got patched down. A lot of Minecraft players were upset about this, and those groups of players included me. Now, I’m still keeping five stars because I wouldn’t know where I’d be without this amazing game, Minecraft. I made lots of friends and when I found out that they played as well, we played until 4 in the morning! Anyway, back to the shields now. Xbox and PC have this now. Im not sure about the Switch, but I really want to play using shields. If Mojang is going to let us merge games with different consoles, then it wouldn’t be fair if they had shields and we didn’t. See what I mean? Now that we merged, I have been looking for shield every update but all we got was Mixer LiveStreaming, Bug Fixes, and Minor Improvements. I would be a bit disappointed if Mojang “forgot” about shields, but I would also totally get it. Everyone makes mistakes. But I hope this is read and useful. Thank you, creators, for this amazing game that took me so far. Thank you. Thank you so much. Have a great day!",BEST MULTIPLAYER GAME EVER!
4,2020-06-02 19:30:11,"Dear Mojang,  I’ve been playing Minecraft for years now and I love it but there is a bug that keeps happening every time. Anyways I made a survival world to unlock all the achievements there. And it was working fine but now it freezes from time to time and I can’t exit the game but I can still move so I wait about five minutes and nothing is happening. So I keep getting out the game and coming back but when I come back some of my stuff is not saved and it sometimes deletes my animals which is really annoying because it’s hard to find more horses that are fast. So I just take a break for a while and I come back. When I come back it seems to be working ok again, so I make a nether portal and go in to try and find the temple. I eventually find it and then head back to my house to get prepared and get better armor and stuff. Ok so I go back to the nether and it freezes again!!! So I exit out the game and get back on and enter the nether again, again it freezes so I keep leaving and coming back and nothing is working! I worked so hard on that world and now I won’t let me go back to the nether without freezing!!! I’ve already reported the bug to Mojang. Hopefully it will be fixed in the next update because I really just wanted to have fun and beat the game for once. Please help me it needs to be fixed!!

5,2019-07-14 18:26:43,"I love Minecraft it’s a great game but I wish they had more animals for and more interactions with pets like, pets can have stats and you can train them like some stats could be Combat, or speed and adding more animals like snails, Slugs, Racoons, Rats, Mice, Goats, More pets, Snakes, and more, but I really want is more food! I think you could add food like More pies, More Fruit, More Vegetables, More Soup, Coconut milk from coconuts, Chocolate milk, Strawberry milk, Fruits I want to be added in soon but it’s okay if these will be in a later update you can take all the time you need to add these like dragon fruit, bananas, Avocado, Pear, Cactus fruit, Mangosteen, Mangos, Lychee, Pineapple, Grapes, Green Apple, Peach, Oranges, Blueberries, Plums, and tons more if you are reading this thank you for reading this Minecraft is one of my favorite games I have had since I was little normally I don’t write reviews but Minecraft is just something I felt like I had to do and I was thinking maybe adding Venus fly traps and flys, maybe more flowers?, onions, and more types of fish like, bass, catfish, and possibly whales! It would be amazing if in a later update one of these are in it.

5,2022-02-23 05:24:18,I like Minecraft because you can play different modes instead of just playing survival or playing on creative mode. Because some times you want to build an entire city in Minecraft and sometimes you want to see how long you can survive in the wild by playing a game. This app has also been on my phone for as long as I’ve had my phone at all! Definitely say that this is longest lasting app on my phone that has been fun for years in a row. And I’ve seen different knock-offs of Minecraft and tried them to see if they’re any better and none of them were. Minecraft is also the ONLY game on my phone that has ZERO ads whatsoever you can just play and won’t be bothered by ads like other games. As great as this all is there just one small thing that would make a huge change on the game. I think that when you pause the game everything in game pauses too because there have been multiple times where I have been killed by a zombie In the game because the game didn’t actually pause. But other than that there’s nothing to complain about in this game. And I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn’t played. And this is by far one of those games that people would have HAVED to play at some point in their life.,Great game 👍 it
5,2019-12-07 19:41:50,"This game is fantastic, but there are a few things that I really think need to be fixed: 1. You cannot place carpet under ladders and doors. It is really annoying and I hope it can be fixed. 2. VOLCANOS! There should definitely be so,e volcanos, ones that are erupting and not. I also think that before creating a new world you should be able to deactivate the volcanos if you wanted. 3. It would be really great if there were different kinds of dogs, especially if there are different types of cats. For example, there are Siamese cats, black cats, orange cats etc...but there is only one kind of dog. I also think that’s there should be wolf spawners (which there is) AND dog spawners for the villages. There are cat and ocelot spawners, but not for dogs. 4. For the people that want the old Minecraft back, the simple one, I don’t think Mojang should change Minecraft, I want Mojang to keep adding more exciting things. HERES MY IDEA SO EVERYONE IS PLEASED: before creating a new world, you should be able to check/cross off certain blocks, mobs, animals etc...this will make it so it’s simpler if you want it to be. For example, you want a world with no cheats, no ravagers, pillagers and dolphins, just cross them off and boom, back to old simple Minecraft.  Anyways, thank you so much for creating this amazing game, I am forever grateful!","Amazing game, but..."
4,2018-04-06 02:01:04,"I absolutely love Minecraft but I don’t love the new update that just came out. For example my inventory is weird. I personally like using the classic version instead of pocket and ever since the last update both versions is very glitchy and it doesn’t show the name of the item. Additionally, when you press an item it sort of highlights the box and I don’t like it. In addition to the latest update I have some suggestions for the new update to make it more enjoyable. 1- New breeds of dogs and cats! I feel that Minecraft needs more dog and cat types to kinda freshen it up and for it to be more interesting. 2- More food! Maybe coffee, sandwiches, burgers, French fries, etc would make it cool. 3- Crazy Craft! I see you tubers (ldshadowlady,smallishbeans,etc) using crazy craft on their computers and I think a free version on Minecraft PE so that all players could get crazy craft and play like the minecrafters they look up to would be really nice! 4- Cameras and Phones. I feel like we need a technology update. I think working phones, computers, cameras, and any thing technological would be really cool to add to the game. Finally, more furniture! Couches, vanity’s, toilet bowls, mirrors, closets and basically anything you would find in a house! I think that, that idea is really cool and would attract many players! If you can do this than thank you! Sorry for being so needy :(",I LOVE Minecraft but....
4,2019-07-10 22:48:29,"I mean Minecraft is a good game. It’s fun and there’s also loads of servers but there is one problem for me. I think you guys updated the game a little too much for the multiplayer part. I love the whole water updates and all that but the multiplayer part is just making the worst in my opinion let me explain. When Minecraft first came out it was sooo easy to join each other all you had to do was be close to the person you wanted to play with and then join. But now you have to have this whole account thing and it’s just waayyy too complicated. And I can’t even join my friends because it just doesn’t work and when it does they immediately get kicked out for some reason and that’s the only reason why I liked Minecraft and now I can’t even play with my friends. But yet again that’s just my opinion. Also I’m on iOS so that may be the problem but idk?🤷‍♀️ Hello me again I have decided to update my review a bit more 💀 I think that you could make this game that 19x better by adding... MORE BIOMS!!!! This game is amazing but to be honest I get kinda tired of just seeing the same bioms over and over again but other that that still an awesome game and I love the new village and cat updates!! 🍬 Oh and one more thing.... you should definitely make jungle, Mesa and mushroom island villages..!! But other that that awesome game🍭🍼",Updated a little too much🤷‍♀️
5,2019-08-20 13:19:16,"This is a great game and I love everything that’s been added recently. But there are a few things that would make the game a bit more interesting. Such as carts that horses or mules could pull, and the player could put stuff in it. Armor for animals like dogs, and cats. It would also be nice to have more birds, like sparrows, hawks, falcons, cardinals, eagles, etc. and something I’ve been wanting since forever, backpacks and torches that light up surrounding areas when held in the hand. Those two things would be very useful for the more adventurous type who don’t like to settle down.  There is one thing that I think would make Minecraft off the charts great. If the terrain wasn’t as poorly generated as it is now and it has smooth transitions to each biome. With true mountains that reach the max build height and unbelievably large caverns that dominate the underground. It would make the sense of adventure so much more incredible if a player could wander into a town and visit a tavern and hear the local news or stumble upon a mighty castle in the mountains. A YouTuber named Jeracraft transforms old Minecraft structures like villages and jungles temple into breathtaking structures and makes mountains realistic.  And something a bit more manageable would be to increase the world build height to something like 400 or even 500.",Great game
4,2020-02-08 02:25:13,"Okay, I legit love Minecraft, I have been playing since 2016. Now, every time I get signed into my Xbox Live account my Minecraft always jams. It doesn’t let me on. When I do get in it doesn’t load my world, so I’m just stuck there for 30+ minutes. Also I’ve bought mine coins and they won’t load in the marketplace. Right now I should have 100 mine coins after my purchases. They just don’t load, the things I’ve bought don’t load either. Recently Minecraft locked my account and idk why. The marketplace wouldn’t load, like I physically could not click the button to open it. It said that there was “an account error” so I just played as an LAN player to play with my friends. Anyways, I got that issue fixed but now my Minecraft won’t load anymore, no severs, it says “coming soon” when I open that tab. Ironically it worked better and would load and let me play with my friends when I was an LAN player. Another thing is the skins. When I try to put in a new skin it just gives me the one i had before, or it just goes invisible and I’m legit a ghost as I play. It’s honestly annoying. I paid for this app with my own money and I would very much like it to work. I love it, so I really don’t want to have to delete it but rn, it looks like I might have to.

And it’s just an island floating on the void with a dragon on it and some creepy guys that kill you if you look at them. The end ship is really fun to raid but I feel like I’d rather go to the nether that not the End because it’s a little boring. Also, my MAIN request, MORE MOBS!! please!!! We need more mobs! We can add in different colored cows and chicken and add new features to some of them! We can have bears, owls, dogs, bulls, monkeys, RED pandas, elephants, and more!! Hedge hogs, tigers, lions, UNICORNS, DRAGONS, GHOSTS!!! It would be Soo fun if we had those updates and I know it’s a lot of work but it would be SO fun!!!!!!!!!!!! Please!

5,2019-04-19 02:13:12,"I played way back in the day. Minecraft PE was fresh off the market. There were no baby animals, spawn eggs, and gravel and sad didn’t fall! And best of all I remember the “Nether Castles,” massive nether forts made from very costly materials just so us PE users could get a feel for the nether. And I remember spending countless hours building building building. I loved it! I recreated some really cool worlds. For instance, I recreated Mean Street in Epic Mickey. But now as the new and exciting updates are being pushed out, PE falls behind. Not in the content! The content lacking version is the PlayStation version. But the bugs and the many glitches hurt us. I get it! It’s impossible to make the perfect game but sometimes the game fails to read simple inputs when I’m hitting the move forward button. This is just an example. Pros outweigh the cons all day. But what’s a review for if the developers don’t read them and consider how to fix it. I believe Microsoft is a very listening company and will hopefully listen to the PE community. Maybe they’ll take a moment and let the game breath!

5,2022-02-13 21:15:22,"Minecraft has been along for a while. I can remember when it was free on the App Store, and I got it. Before me, it was my dad who showed me the ways of Minecraft. We would play together. And the more I grew, the game grew too. Next thing you know, the games adding axolotls and goats! It’s so amazing how much this game has expanded and grew over the years. I mean, it’s a bit more difficult with making skins and stuff like that, and with those brand new skin updates, at first I was mad at them, but I learned how to control it and all. The more it grew, the less people (at least my friends) played it. I stoped after a while. After among us came out, it’s the only thing people would talk about and the only thing I would play. No one really liked Minecraft anymore, but my little sister played it. I learned from her it doesn’t matter if it’s popular, because it’s still awesome. I am happy I grew up with this app. It is and always will be my favorite game. Even if it’s old, it’s the best game in the world. The only thing that would make me cry in happiness is if FNAF did a mash-up with Minecraft Thank you for reading this. 😊BTW I got this glitch when I got free mine coins. I didn’t mind.

Im still on IOS9, and the game lags sooo much, especially when friends are joining the world. I’m just worried I might lose the world if I can’t update Minecraft or the phone breaks. This world is really special to me, and I would be disappointed if it got lost. I have an iPhone 8, along with my old iPod. All I’m asking from you is one thing. Please please please add a feature where you can download your friends worlds onto your device. This will allow me to get my favorite world onto my new iPhone, and not have to worry anymore about losing it. I understand that it is probably really hard to add features out of the blue, and that it may take time, but please! I would love you guys forever if you did that. I know some other people who have this problem, and it would probably help many other people if you could put this into Minecraft pocket edition. I realize that there are bugs in the game right now, but honestly, I won’t mind if this feature was added. Please... that is all I want.

5,2019-04-11 11:50:18,"I love Minecraft! Though there a few additions that I see as needed. Flying animals, as we only have one tamable flying animal. Maybe there could be snowy owls that fly over tundras, ice spikes, and snowy forests, that you could either tame with fish ( or any meat )or steal an egg from a nest in a snowy forest to hatch. Once tamed you could possibly be able to let the snowy owl out and it could come back in a couple of days with a gift of meat. There could also be barn owls, screech owls, and great horned owls, that soared over forests ( no snow), and possibly grass lands with the same properties as the snowy owl. There could also be just normal birds in forests like blue jays, robins, cardinals, doves, crows Etc. Now that the real flying animals have been covered, this brings us to dragons! Maybe there could be one dragon nest in the heart of every biome with an egg guarded by a grown dragon that you have to defeat to get the egg, possibly when you get close the dragon nest the dragon will start slowly stalking your character. Then once you get the egg it will hatch in an area with lots of light. Then once full grown you can make a saddle and put chests on it for storage, and fly it! Maybe you must also give it lots of meat every now and then to take care of it or it will become feral. I hope you read this/ like the ideas mojang!",Few additions needed
2,2018-11-12 01:03:52,"This game is very fun except sometimes you have to start completely over and reset everything! This has happened to me twice before, and each time I had multiple very accomplished worlds. What happens is that one second, it’s working just fine, and then when you try to get on it next time, you can’t even make it to the loading screen without it crashing. When this happens, it keeps happening, and you can’t get onto your Minecraft, not even onto your home screen, so you can try to find out what is wrong. Every time this happens to me, it is completely hopeless, and I end up deleting Minecraft. Then, when I redownload it, I lose all of my worlds, skins, servers, and everything except your Xbox live account, which you have to log back into. It is the most annoying thing ever, and I hate it so much. The reason I am actually writing this review is because I am hoping someone at Mojang will see it, and try to troubleshoot the problem. Also, when I tried to look up my problem on Minecraft forums, it looked like a bunch of other people have had the exact same problem, and it’s not getting fixed. If this problem doesn’t get fixed, I’m deleting Minecraft altogether because it was a complete waste of my money.

Once I installed the update and opened up minecraft, what would normally be the Mojang logo was a black rectangle, and when the loading screen popped up the game crashed, and this is even after the new hotfix thing. On my opinion I suggest ( this is for Mojang ) that you guys fix it because I am one of the biggest minecraft fans I know. And even though I stayed within the terms of use I got kicked off my Microsoft account, and that is where all my minecoins and mashups are saved to. 😜 it is still a good game if you like building though!👾 you also get to survive dangerous mobs and explore strongholds, find the end portal and defeat the Ender Dragon if you like that kind of stuff.

Does anyone know what to do?",I love this game but the latest update...
5,2022-01-16 04:38:49,"So I first got this game around the aquatic update and for years I didn’t realize how big of a game this was. Years later I am familiar with the history and future of Minecraft. This game lets imagination flow freely from your heart and brain straight into a giant 3D canvas, filled with many things to explore but at the same time has plenty of space to create whatever comes to mind. One thing I noticed is that the case with most games is that they do a great job on it for a long time but then it is changed too much and it loses its signature style of game. However, this is not the case with Minecraft. Minecraft has changed so much throughout the years but it still keeps the same style gameplay. Every update seems to be an improvement to the already great game. The community it really nice and Mojang always listens to suggestions and keeps us hyped for the next update. That is all I would like to add, if you don’t already have this game, I would highly recommend this game for anybody with an imagination. Thank you for giving the time to read this review.  P.S. If you are new and notice that there are a few bugs here and there just be patient with it as a new update has been released and it will be a bit buggy.",Fantastic Game!!!
5,2019-08-14 16:08:56,"So I’ve been playing this game since before it was even a thing. What I wish came back was old servers. Ya there is a setting to go to servers that end, but those old servers, now they are like a mod. I was thinking for your next update, you should make more world settings that you can change to make it more advanced. For example, making it so you can put in words for the seed instead of just numbers. I mean, you could do that in old Minecraft. Also, a change that I’ve seen is the death sound was removed, I loved that sound man, animals walk around holes now, so you gotta do even more work to get let’s say carrots or wheat, the mountains that are added to servers, ya they don’t got any openings on them where you can build a house, in old Minecraft, everyone did that, and just the fact that old seeds don’t work breaks my heart. I had this server called the creeper cave server, right? No one knows the seed, and you can’t type it in either. I would tell you the seed, but it is on my kindle fire that is broke. What I’m saying is, you should make adjustments or even make a whole new game where it was just like the old days. And in my opinion, there was no downside, just the fact that updates overtook what I knew about Minecraft.",I wish you brought back the old Minecraft
5,2021-01-17 17:22:52,"What is happening to mobile Minecraft I don’t get it. Servers are gone the mine store is gone it crashes randomly, I mean seriously I love this game but it seems like you don’t care about this platform. No snapshots why is the red stone completely different. I’d understand if there was actually something holding you back from changing it but there isn’t. You need Xbox live just to play on a server. Not to mention how unbalanced pvp is mobile vs pc. If we get it we can’t attack back because it stops you when you take damage. And it will randomly freak out and make the screen shake all over the place when you try to look around. My god either act like we exist and bring us as close to the others as we should be or admit you don’t care about mobile Andy more and that no updates are happening to fix it. 70% of the updates are “bug fixes” but nothing has changed still no servers will no store still no character creator. It’s sad to see such a well received game run into the ground by new management that cares for nothing but profit. The minstore itself is ruining the game.... I want to love this platform but it’s so frustrating having this happen again and again and again and again to the games I enjoy. Fix yourself Microsoft fix the game.",MOJANG THIS IS IMPORTANT
5,2020-01-03 23:19:47,"This happened in my main single player world. I was building a long bridge to try and get to a endcity, when all of a sudden, I fell off. I was really irritated, and so I cheated, yeah, sorry, but I went into creative, then flew back, and I went back, started flying around. Couldn’t find my bridge, then I found another endcity portal. Like the bedrock diamond that you throw a ender pearl into to reach endcites. So I threw it in bc I was curious. And, I ended up in the battle arena where you fight the ender dragon. I was confused, but I wasn’t to bothered. So I went back up to my other end city portal u unlock when defeating the ender dragon, and THEN I threw the pearl into there, AND I GOT TELEPORTED INTO THE VOID AND DIED! I WAS STILL IN THE BATTLE ARENA TOO I DIDN’T GET TELLEPORTED TO THE ENDCITY PLACE! I tried again, and this time I got teleported to the other portal that leads to the over world. I couldn’t reach the endcity. And I was so. Con. Fused. I teleported back to the other portal I found, and I got teleported back to the arena. I tried this tons more times, and the same thing happened. I broke everything. I don’t know wether this was supposed to happen, but I don’t think so. So I write this. I want to point out this game is awsome. And I spent lots of awsome times here, but I just wanted to point out this weird glitch.",Awsome! But something weird happened
3,2022-09-29 05:42:26,Okay great game I love it grew up playing this and I really enjoy the new updates one problem the joining a friends server and it saying unable to connect really pisses me off this game has had that problem for years now and I can’t seem to get any signal I’ve tried everything looked everywhere and still gives me trouble like it’s not that hard other games easily connect with everyone else’s I think they are focusing on everything else besides the point and the point is I can’t play with others so it kills the mood I no longer play due to me staying on the loading screen for 2 hours before decided to play another game with my buddies I had just tried for another 30 mins and i just am fed up I really think they should focus on the online servers before adding anything else on the worlds really makes me shocked Microsoft a company that has dedicated itself to the worlds best connections can’t figure such a simple thing out that many I’m talking about all the games out now have easily done so I’m just not gonna play until Microsoft finally plays and no I’m not saying I don’t wanna play to throw a fit like literally game is so boring without friends so please just spend ur budget wisely Microsoft and fix ur online issue everyone is fed up and yes I’ve tried everything and it never works for me so please fix it,Really frustrated
5,2020-03-11 21:09:28,"Both my brother and I have lost things from the store after making an account to save these things. The point of making an account is to save your worlds and packs you buy, and that has proven to be inefficient. We have spend money on these things and they just disappear, and the best part? The free worlds we get are still there. We only lost the packs that cost money. Please fix this, my brother is devastated because he plays Minecraft so much and enjoys these packs, and now they’re gone. He can’t even buy them again, when he goes to the store to the texture pack he bought, it says he cannot but the pack. Now onto me: I made an account before buying things, and even then i still have lost the worlds that i spent my money on. I lost the packs when i switched phones. I bought a new phone and logged into my Microsoft account to get my worlds and packs, some made by me and some i had bought. Now, all the worlds that i made (my survival world, my role play creative world, and my experimental worlds), they all saved, except the worlds i bought from the store. The point of making an account is to save your packs that you buy, and this hasn’t worked. Please get back to me on this.",Store Problems
3,2019-09-04 22:14:26,So like any other day I logged into Minecraft right no I tried loading in this world it said no problem indicated or other words can’t get on the world then I try another map then I try is survival world it still does not work I’ve tried deleting it and logging back on to Xbox live then I tried restarting my iPad to type it and it still won’t work then I’m thinking oh I just need to shut it off and turn it back on nope it still does not work but another words if it doesn’t glitch for you then I would read it five stars but this is the third time I’ve had it done it or maybe fifth I don’t know really but I had to start playing for a year on my old iPad which was an eight-year-old iPad so I don’t blame  Minecraft for that but I got a new iPad last Christmas and it worked for a little bit then I had to restart it or as you know delete it and then re-download it but it didn’t work then I just stop playing it for a month and then everything was fine after that and then I happened again so I really don’t know what’s the problem it’s just like it came out of know where then all of a sudden boom Bam it just happened and on my other iPad it happened about three or two times obviously I was very upset about that but who can buy in Minecraft for it who is a years old but other words you should get the app if it doesn’t glitch for you .,Weird things happened
5,2018-10-01 02:59:20,"Hey everyone I’m sure you are familiar with the game Minecraft. It’s a very fun game you get to create anything that you want, but I’ve ran in to some issues with this game they’re not big but just minor issues. First my brother and me really like having battles so some new types of armor would be nice such as titanium armor or a make believe type of armor like dragon plate armor that would be nice. Another thing would be that if y’all would add new weapons like battle axes and scythes. Now with the final part of the battles we need soldiers and minions. That would be awesome my brother and me have had a bunch of ideas like Armed Soldier where they spawn in these things called Bases they drop ammo and different guns. Now for building, I liked the textures on the some off the beautiful blocks in this game but where is the furniture like couches, chairs, and other furniture and appliances like plates and cups. I would like to see this in the game it would make it better. I just looked at the new update Aquatic and I liked it a lot, me personally I like the way that Mojang added vibrant and more life in the oceans and bodies of water in Minecraft   Mojang if you’re reading this I hope you add some of these things to make your game a tad bit better and this has been Lunatic0914 I’m out later",Minecraft Review
5,2023-09-04 15:49:12,Hi there are some things I want you to add on your next update I’m sorry what is this update agian?

I’m not joking I want voice chat on this yeah yeah you tubers use it but hey I’m not famous I’m a creep and everyone calls me that let’s go to the next one number two: so if multiplayer is on put it on iPads and now to the real one can we play with random people it’s my dream to meet people so that’s why it’s stuck to my head and two more left number three add custom worlds let players make there own world like I want to make a bunker so make a bunker mod or if I want to make a escape the room game make a escape the room mod private finale one number 4 add rainbows and canons also make potion of mean where if you drink it or someone else does there say rude things without typing only use it on bully’s or single player thanks for reading Bye!

5,2022-03-07 05:25:04,"I’ve always loved Minecraft. Ever since I was a little kid and all I had was a kindle. I’ve seen things come to this game that I could have never imagined, and I remember my first experience in Minecraft. My cousin had it on his iPod and showed me around his base that he made in the clouds. I was instantly hooked. Gameplay since then has very much improved, though I do dislike the newest 1.18 updates, mostly because it makes certain aspects of the game more annoying to deal with. Yes I understand most don’t agree with me but it’s something you should at least think about. Minecraft wasn’t meant to be a super challenging game at its base, it’s meant to be something you kick back for hours and relax with. The new caves make exploring a good bit more challenging, and while most like a challenge, it shouldn’t be forced on you to begin with. You challenge yourself, that’s what makes the challenges that were in the game fun. Like I said though, the game is still amazing and definitely on my top 10 games list, likely there to stay. My take is likely due to me just liking the past and not really trying to adapt to the new caves but eh, don’t let my on pe measly review change your view of the game.",Still one of the best games out there
2,2021-11-30 16:41:24,"Minecraft, the sand box game that is great and all but there’s some things that need to be added or fixed. This may include update ideas or bugs and glitches or just thing you need to add back in. 1: Bundles are helpful items used for carrying things easily but for some reason they weren’t added in caves and cliffs part 2. We’ve been waiting a long time for these items but they weren’t in the update please add bundles. 2: The end dimension is kinda boring, the concept is cool going to a mysterious dimension and battling a mighty dragon. It’s cool but really there’s nothing there really the only things you can do there is defeat the ender dragon get the egg and get a elytra and then you really have no reason to ever come back so I think it will be a cool idea if you made a end update with new mobs new biomes and more because the end is just a void right now so please add a end update (And no 2 parts). 3: Why did you remove old world generation the ones that give you a limited space. Please atleast  that give us the world border command. 4: A bug I got was one day in the list of seeds I was missing the survive island seed. The next the survive island seed was back but the epic jungle seed was gone few days later the survive island seed was gone and the epic jungle seed was back. That was some of my thoughts so far I will probily made a part 2 of my reviews but that’s it for now please fix or add some of these thing bye.",Another review
5,2020-09-19 22:48:58,Hi I have been playing Minecraft since I was about 4 or 5 I’ve showed it to my friend and family and we all love it I even got my daddy playing it although all of my family and friends also agree how some of the new things are causing massive glitches like the character creator on that the Skinseed dosent work in multiplayer anymore and we have to spend both money and time to get the look we want to share here is another glitch I’m trying to get a pack from let’s say Noxcrew and I’m getting elf patrol or something well I’ve been sitting there so long and it say purchase in progress this shouldn’t take long well spoiler alert it does and it never works I try everything swiping all my apps up on mobile powering of my tablet  waiting and it won’t work I managed to get one and it was not even very fun I really want this one game from no crew and it just will not work I am really disappointed 😔 in these glitches another glitch that happens is sometimes if the app suddenly thinks you should delete something it constantly kicks you out and does not make a backup this does not happen as often as it used to but it’s still a problem for many people thank you for your time for reading this and I hope you have heard me goodbye Mojang. 🙂,Glitches
5,2020-09-14 13:52:37,I have been playing since it came out and I love it soooo much and I feel like the next update should have like chairs in different colors and tables you can place anything on remember it’s just a suggestion and my a more modern type of furnace and a fridge cuz my and my siblings love making houses so it would be good for decore and maybe some drawers and a kitchen cabinet and a closet as I said 3 times I’m just suggesting you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to but I always will love playing Minecraft but also there has been worse glitches since the last update like when I put something in my inventory it won’t go out I try removing it but doesn’t go 2nd is when I’m playing or I’m trying to enter or join a world I get kicked out the hole game of course cuz I like playing it I try to find solutions but some times it don’t work and my game sometimes freezes and then it kicked me out I’m just saying but you do you it’s an amazing game and I will always keep playing live the game it’s amazing but if you are willing to do the next update suggestion I would love them to be able to be different colors but as I said you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to thank you for mak ni Minecraft I love it 😀😀,I LOVE THE GAME THIS IS SUGGESTION FOR NEXT UPDATE and problem glitch
5,2018-12-31 12:48:18,"Minecraft Is a AWESOME game. And I am never bored when it’s around. It feels like everything is possible! Creating is Awesome. And its hard in real life to build and get materials, and It would take a long time. In Minecraft it can take one day and you have a awesome creation Next to you. Its fun to make your world your favorite way. Also I can choose exactly what I start out with. I can do survival or creative, easy or hard, normal or peaceful, and I get to pick my seed. You can also explore which is really fun. You get to challenge yourself and fight which I love. If you don’t gave Minecraft I don’t know how you live.  Also you can buy stuff in the store. You can get a world made for you. I bought luxury life and can’t stop playing. It was so worth the money. You can also buy textures for your worlds. You can change the look of you character and buy new looks or skins.  And finally you can play with friends. You can come into your friends worlds or you can have friends come into yours. If you have a Xbox you can play on a world with 1000 other people or so. It is funner when a friend is in your game. It makes everything go much faster. It won’t be as scary hen your fighting monsters. Go get Minecraft right now. Don’t forget what I said.",Everything Is possible!
5,2021-02-23 02:07:14,"Minecraft is absolutely fantastic. I’ve been playing for a few years and lately I’ve really observed on how much this game has evolved. So many things have changed but that has made it even better! You can do so many spectacular things, especially with your imagination when it comes to it. As soon as I open Minecraft I already have hundreds of ideas! I love the graphics, it may not be some other people’s kind of things such as my fathers, and I respect that decision. Though Minecraft will always be a favorite of mine, I will NEVER but less than 5 stars of rating on Minecraft. I love how it instructs you on how to play, I love how you may add textures, buy skins, and add shaders. It makes the game an even better experience. I don’t think I have any problems, none to be exact. Though I do think you should put shaders in the stores, i don’t think there’s any... you can usually only find them on websites and though it is right in front of you, it’s a very large and confusing process to add them to game. Other then that it’s an amazing game, if I could give a higher rating, I would. Though I sadly can’t, in my perspective, for this game my 5 stars means a 20 or higher. I love all of you creators so much!! Thank you for this awesome game! 🤎💚",Fantastic. 🌳🐴🐮🐺
5,2020-11-04 15:47:12,"Hey there creators, I know that it is a pain to make huge updates, but we need something different than the end and the nether, we need a new dimension that is harder than ever before, we need new item, new tools, I mean like 2 or three different types of tools , make a way to create something like dual weapons, maybe armor that allows us to fly at end game, the update after that, make it where the armor is even better. We need new things to keep us interested. Armor that allows us to fly is my main objective, I suggest calling it a supremium ingot, it starts with finding supremium debri that  gives us supremium essence when we dig it, and when we finish mining that and we go to use it we have to use a special crafting table made out of pure blocks of gold that is really hard to craft, and please make larger chest, please do, when the ingots are formed we can turn that into supremium armor and tools, make the tools do 12 attack damage and it has a bleeding effect too please, add dark matter essence that creates block that we use for a portal and only can be mines in the nether , this is just some ideas i thought of but I am sure flying armor would satisfy many people along with new dimensions as well,",This Game Needs Something New
5,2022-10-02 13:46:15,When I first played Minecraft my brother put it on hard mode and I was only like five years old!!!!! nobody even explain to me how to play it! but I will explain to you! Minecraft is a wonderful game it’s a pixelated game or you can build anything you want to survive and take out a dragon! that’s how you beat the game on survival mode! survival mode is where you could possibly die if you put it on easy normal or hard mode in the settings then there will be monsters if you put it on hard mode there will be the most monsters! if you put it on creative mode then you can build till your hearts content if I could I would give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ that many stars I also like how there’s always new updates the updates are the best!! it made me excited when they added frogs to Minecraft anyway it always makes me excited to update it because Minecraft always has so many updates I love the new Redwood style anyway if you want to build and survive or whichever way you want to play then go ahead and download it! you can play with friends and there are special things that allow you to do stuff that regular Minecraft can’t do on the marketplace! there’s also specific apps that allow you to do that!!!,BEST APP EVER
5,2019-06-16 14:02:27,"I have been playing this game since 2014, and it was just... amazing! I loved how it was this pixelated world where you could make anything you imagined in block form! I really liked survival mode, where it’s like your the person who will conquer enemies and help the world! It kinda helped me prepare for a zombie apocalypse, or a disaster! I thought this type of game wouldn’t have existed if Minecraft hadn’t had released into the world of games! Throughout all, I think it’s a pretty good game! It inspires people to use their imagination and to just create it! Although, there are a few things within the game that kinda bother me. So you have to have a account to play in servers, and that’s just a bit unfair to those who don’t have one, or aren’t able to get one onto Minecraft. I understand if there’s a thing that’s blocking that, so I completely understand. Another thing is getting free worlds. Sometimes after I purchase a free world from the shop, it has a red exclamation mark, and it says ‘your account’ something-something, I can’t remember. Those are the problems I have with the game, but they aren’t so bad! Anyways, I hope you read this!

4,2019-05-21 21:05:13,"So I play The PC version a lot more. I say that because I think that the PC version is the only version that hasn’t been ruined. The PC version is so enjoyable because it’s still original. Microsoft hasn’t touched it. If they do, I think we’re all gonna be pretty ticked off. The only reasons I hate MCPE is because of the inventory and the store. The inventory is bad because of how it’s organized. Nature? What happened to foodstuffs and decorations? The only think that is practically the same is the combat section minus the potions. The other reason I hate the inventory is the grouping. I hate having to open a menu IN my inventory for one single block or item.  The store is bad because it just is. Yea, you can’t download a map on a phone or tablet. But you shouldn’t have to pay real money for one dinky little world. The PC version can just look up a map, find the URL, download it, and just play it. But that’s only because it’s a computer. I’m pretty sure a phone can’t handle that sort of thing. And the only reason downloading worlds with real money is because it’s just Microsoft trying to rip you off. You can literally just download an app to find original worlds, texture packs, etc. Yes, most apps are shams that you have to pay for anyways, but there are plenty free, good apps.

And be able to take the tag off and there should be more animals and the villages should be more like neighborhoods and a grocery market and the villagers should be more like people and a pet store and the villagers should have names and there should be emojis and they use those to show their feelings and u can be buddy.

5,2022-02-22 23:40:59,"I rate this a 5/5 because Minecraft is such a fun game! You can build anything you want, and basically let you’re imagination run wild. There’s different modes like creative, survival, ect. The updates are really cool and also this game has progressed a long way. I do have some suggestions though. For the next update, maybe adding small details to the game like in caves tiny rocks on the ground or the water animation being a bit smoother. Second, maybe add some more animals, or adding detail to them. Minecraft has most animals we commonly know, but maybe adding a few more bugs like spiders. Also adding frogs or snakes I know would be hard but it would be cool if you could add animals like that, reptiles, jungle animals like Jaguar and monkeys, African animals like lions and giraffes, ect. Adding more objects to the game could also be a nice touch. Don’t get me wrong, there’s A LOT of objects and blocks you can use in Minecraft, though maybe adding simple furniture or more precise details would make Minecraft just that much better. If you do come across this, thank you for reading this and I hope you thrive making this game the best it can be.

5,2021-04-19 14:28:39,"I have loved Minecraft for a long time. I have recently gotten myself an account. The whole reason why is wanted one was to play with my friends. Sadly, I cannot play on their worlds, and they can’t on mine. When ever I clicked their world button to join, it goes through some loading screens. And then it shows a screen with a classic dirt background saying: Unable to join world. Many others are also having this problem. Also, I like playing on Mineplex. There is a game in it called Master Builders. I love playing, but it is really hard because chunks won’t load, and chat, and inventory take long to open. Every time I play, my chunks barely load. And when it is time to judge, I can’t see anything except the players. (Note: at the time I was playing, the server had low PNG. I don’t know if thats good or bad, but I think it’s good.) Also, can you make it so the world audio is different than the whole game audio. I don’t want to hear music in the background when I’m in a world, but I do when I’m at the Minecraft Home Screen.

When I started playing it was fun, and the updates Mojang have added are great, and the make the game so much more interesting. This has become an activity I can do with my family and friends, and it is super fun. My only complaint is one time my game glitches very and I mean very badly. It wouldn’t come off of the loading screen and I had to delete and  download the game. I lost all of my worlds, including some I made with my family that were super special. This happened a long time ago, (maybe a year or two at most) but I lost all of my worlds and I had to start over completely. I love having a Microsoft account that makes it really good for playing with friends and Minecraft has helped keep me and my friends in close contact. Overall, Minecraft is great, and I’m really glad I play it. Thanks!  I want to update this. I still love the game. Still 1,000,000 out of 5. I forgot to mention a couple things. Once when I played in the friends section it said one was playing. So I thought hey let’s go play with my friends. It was a stranger who didn’t friend. Ever.",Awesome
3,2019-09-17 18:05:40,"So great game hands down. It’s Minecraft. It’s obviously great. However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design.   1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.  2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend. Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.",Game Works When It Wants To
5,2021-05-04 15:48:31,So great game but I had this really cool world where I build this whole thing but then I got lost and couldn’t find my way back and now 8 am lost form it forever 😢 I don’t need you to fix my game but this has happened 2 times so can you make a save feature or an automatic save thing so that if you get lost you can reload back to your previous save because the save and quit button doesn’t have like a save file for before you saved it and left so if you add that I think me a others would have more fun still 5 stars though great game  Also for all the 1 star reviews ok first there is a difference between 1 star I don’t know how to change this in settings and 1 star I lost my account which one is actually important before you write one star look around the game and figure it out or do you want to go to all those ad filled games and complain some more about stuff that isn’t really important unless something happened like you lost your account don’t jump to 1 star if you need help In Settings just leave a 4 or 3 star review don’t just go to 1 star oh and for people who are scared of sounds go to settings and turn down the audio that’s all you have to do,One thing great game
5,2020-03-23 05:04:41,"The super duper graphics pack was canceled and then you guys added one for PC and then the PE got to get whatever shader, but I want it for consoles to because you guys canceled the SDGP, with was for every playing thing.  Graphics on my console would be a huge thing to me because I’ve been playing since I was 4 years old and I have been able to gain lots of skills,  BUT!, it still is missing something and that would be the graphics.  The beauty of the shaders is better then anything,  and the water effects, the sun effects, and the shine, that would be cool,  especially when you said SOME of us where disappointed on the cancellation of the SDGP.  I’m sorry but all of us were disappointed and I would like you guys to make up for it.  It’s just that, you guys added the store, the custom skins, and the bee and nether update,  but the console will still be waiting for you guys,  I’m in 7th grade and Minecraft is a habit I have and it’s fun and I don’t care what people think about it,  WE just want what you guys promised us,  because you guys kept all of them but this one.  Plz make it up to all the console players and the others.  I hope you guys put this into consideration.  - Sincerely apeng_ii",The shaders NOT FOR EVERYONE😕
5,2019-06-03 02:50:31,"Literally no game could ever top Minecraft and it’s pure simplicity. It gives people an opportunity to be creative and do whatever they desire without people constantly trying to get their money or bombard your experience with ads! Granted you can pay for skins and cool adventure maps, but that’s besides the point. There is no “Pay to get to the nether” or “pay for this certain enchantment”, it’s pure gameplay. There is no set story, you get to make that story with each world you create. There’s a little something for everyone, whether you love to explore different biomes or mine the deepest parts of caves. Whether you want to build the biggest kingdom of all time, or simply have an animal farm. This game is for literally every person, which is why it makes it one of, if not the greatest game of all time. Let me not forget the music and how peaceful it is and how nostalgic it is. If you are considering buying this for little Timmy and are questioning it because of zombies and monsters, think again. That’s only a small part of this game with infinite possibilities. This gives you a chance to escape to a world that YOU create! It’s perfect for long car rides, or for playing with your friends. Get this game. You will never regret it.",Greatest game of all time

For example! Me and my sister would always play together whit no problem at all! But now you have to create your account to play! I can no longer play with my sis Bc I rlly don't want to create an account!   What-happened-to the old Minecraft? Everything was so great.... exploring, crafting, mining, and even roll playing was fun.... but now you have added to man stuff.... you have added this new world where u have to pay for them.... u made us create and account so we could play with others.... which was wrong! Minecraft should be safe and fun! If u have to prove that u have permission... then why not just make it like the old times where u only needed to be close to your friend to join in the same server! That was all! No creating and account no nothing! It was as simple as that! OOOH and don't get me started on the ""u have to pay for a world!!! A skin pack, a mash up!!"" WHAT HAPPENED TO MINE CRAFT ?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! What happened to being creative? All the things u have added lately have been horrible!!! I still want to play it!

5,2020-05-30 01:41:08,"Good Game! Been playing for almost 5 or so years. One of my favorite things in it is the redstone. There’s one problem though: redstone dust, repeaters, and comparators are like one block. Therefore, they can’t fit under slabs. I would love to see them be able to count as half-blocks so they can fit under slabs. I would also like to see an item, similar to the structure block, but you can get it in survival, and it only places a layout of the structure that has been saved in it. So if you save, let’s say, a tree, then click load, it will only load transparent ghost blocks of the blocks that were being used. I would also like to see a command that can fill things, like chests. Maybe something like /fillitem [item] [amount]. Also one last thing, it would be amazing and very useful for named ender chests to only share the items that have the same name so multiple people on a world/server won’t have to put the same items in the same ender chest. Also, please make it so that ender chests can interact with furnaces. I don’t know if mojang or anyone who is somehow connected to anyone at mojang, but if they are, PLEASE add/ask Mojang to add these, or at least consider them. I hope to see these in a coming update",A few things I’d like to see
4,2019-08-22 17:57:07,"Minecraft is the best could literally define this review! Right now I’m building a modern mansion because I completed building a medium sized cottage. Once I’m done with my mansion I’m gonna go on a bunch of adventures looking for some pretty hard stuff to find. I may try to defeat an ender dragon! But honestly creative mode is the BEST! You can express yourself so easily with friends!!! I bought this game with absolutely NO REGRETS! I really like building houses, visiting my friends, taking animals, and adventuring in mines, and beyond! Including the waters 🌊!!! I have this cute pink and purple skin and I ❤️ it so much!! I don’t have many minecons since I started about 4 months ago and plus I spend basically all my time in creative mode so I’m really looking forward to the minecon event. And if your still not interested, there’s an EDUCATIONAL MODE which I don’t use but you can if you want 😄over all I’m obsessed with this game and it’s totally worth the money!!! Also all of a sudden I can’t play with my friends? I set up my gamer tag even on the Xbox app but when I try to friend my bffs or they try to friend me it says I can’t friend people because of how my account is set up so me and my family were trying to fix it but it wouldn’t work! Please help! But even if I can’t play with my friends it’s really fun I just wished I could!",OMG
5,2019-06-03 02:17:09,"Minecraft is amazing! Absolutely fun and incredible and has always been my childhood game! There are so many ways to express your creativity and build so many things you wouldn’t be able to in real life! But I was wondering if you guys would soon add different dog skins as well, since Minecraft PE has different cat skins, but wolves only have one and many other players would enjoy it as well! This is only a request, so it’s perfectly fine if it can’t be developed into the game as I understand it takes a while to put new things into the game, but it would be very much appreciated if possible! It can give players new ideas for their pet shop, and expanding the pets in Minecraft as players are able to get a variety of different dogs rather then just one! Me and my friends would also very much appreciate it, as one of my friends love animals! She is so inspired playing Minecraft it gives her new ideas and a topic for us to talk about when it gets awkward ;^; This idea would be really cool and lots of players would probably definitely love it! ( like I mentioned though, if it currently isn’t possible to do, please don’t stress about it ) ❤️  -sincerely a Minecraft player :3",Was wondering if Minecraft PE can have different dog skins as well! •3•
5,2018-07-29 05:14:32,FRIST: l would really like if mojang added bears beavers dears squirrels ants and elephants.    Second: I would also like if mojang would add quick sand to make the quick sand u would need a bucket of water and place it on some sand and I would also like if there would be more dogs like huskys they would be found in the snow biome and and I would also like if there was a oven block wand a sink block with a water a effect and I would also like if there were a way to make your own skin in Minecraft         Third:  I would like if there were acid rain and a lighting rod were u could have a stick in your hand and during a lightning storm and then the stick would turn into a cool lightning rod then u can attack with lighting I would also like if mojang they added paint to paint the house we make and I would like if they added pirate boats and u can ride them and and put all of your diamonds and stuff in the pirate boat we would have to make the pirate boat with two black banners sticks wood and if they would add Dinosours and make a Dinosaur biome THANK YOU FOR READING I HOPE MY IDEAS GET IN THE GAME THX AND TO NEW PLAYERS OF MINECRAFT THIS IS THE BEST GAME U WILL EVER PLAY THANK YOU MOJANG FOR MAKING THIS GAME AND I HOPE U READY THIS AND MAKE MY IDEAS INTO THE GAME THX!!!!!! :D :) :) :D :D :D :D :D,Best game ever made but I would like to add some stuff
5,2021-06-23 22:00:59,"Ok so I have been playing this game for about 4 yrs and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! I know you (Mojang) are pretty busy with everything, but... I (And everyone else) WOULD LOVE NEW MOBS!!! And.... also, maybe some new types of dogs? I LOVE how there are multiple cats... but why not multiple different types of dogs??? I love the idea of most of the animals (like parrots, cats, uhhh.... I think that’s it) having different colors, but dogs (wolves) don’t... I’m not complaining (well... sort of) but I understand that you are busy. It would also be REALLY COOL and super helpful if you could like either make plates or make the bowls placeable. I have always wanted to place the food down on bowls/plates or even on the ground or tables but... ya can’t. I wrote about a year ago talking about how it would be nice if you could do other stuff to eggs than just throwing them, making cakes with them, and collecting them. I was thinking maybe add a feature where you can make a skillet or something like that out of iron which, technically you can just cooked an egg in the furnace!! And it could be like a “cooked egg” or a “scrambled egg”. Thank you so much for reading! Please take this into consideration on your spare time!!!",Best game but needs more animals!
5,2021-06-17 16:16:41,There’s been some problems with all these new updates they are terrible I dread every new update that comes out because it’s either more things I have to do to complete the game or just random crap that doesn’t need to be added I’ve been playing this game since the second it came out on pocket edition and they have changed it so much I’m just saying this new world textures is bull I'm so mad about it although it is the only video game I play still you guys need to change all the textures back and bring back old Samson and cod please please oh please I wouldn’t mind more swords and armor and I thought of a thing called a heart cage you can find them but they are rarer than enchanted apples and they give you an infinite heart whether you make it so you loose it when you die or not this would be a great idea thanks for the game just please oh please do what I said also lots oh people hate the new textures to I mean read the comments mojang but thanks for this game but oh yeah also please add the 1.9 combat update to bedrock I would play it so much more and buy more merch if you did and if you want to talk to me my Minecraft user name for both Java and bedrock is Nephenzepher okay thanks and fix it,Okay listen mojang
4,2022-12-25 21:05:46,"Quick issue: I cannot separate items in my inventory. I’ve tried many times and tried to fix it, but nothing worked. My friend says it works for her, so I’m not sure what the issue is. This greatly affects my gameplay. I’m assuming it’s from the newer updates that for some reason changed how you move stuff in your inventory. I personally hate it, and so does my friend. Also, when you take something out of a furnace after cooking/smelting it, you can’t interact with items in your inventory. Please change it back to the way it was. I used to be able to perfectly interact with my inventory, and now it’s extremely difficult. Also, there are multiple items I had (for character customization, mainly hats) before I got an account. I got an account, which kept my things, but once I signed out? Stuff was missing. I had many things I can no longer get back. I have yet to sign back into my account, but I mostly prefer playing outside of it, so this is really disappointing. Aside from these things, I love this game. I have never spent more time on any one game in my life, and I’ve played Minecraft since probably 6 years ago. It’s incredible, so continue the good work and please fix at least the first issue. 🤙","Great game, but a few issues"
5,2018-12-22 01:49:43,"I love this panda and stray cats update, it really cool but I would like to put some suggestions as my title says. So, first things first, I would love for you all to put in chairs, couches, tables, you name it from the PC! Because having chairs and couches made out of stairs, signs, and slabs is kind of boring to be honest. I would love it to have a few things like the PC has. Second, I would love for the stuff like skins and maps for it to be lowered like 50 coins less or 100 less because some of them are extremely expensive for you to buy the coins and purchase some although I know you need the money to make stuff along with patience and time, I understand. Third, I would love for you to add the animal ears and tails for PE because it would be so cool since I’m a meifwas, kitzune, werewolf/wolf, dragon, and more fantasy-like fan and I think others would like it to.     I know it would take a LOT of time for you all to make some of these suggestions to come true. Take all the time you need, I won’t mind because I have to have a bit of patience for something so I can be having more patience for other things to!

5,2018-01-06 02:30:16,"Plz take a moment to read this. I've been a fan of this game since I was like 8...back when it was just cows, pigs, sheep and chickens. I do like the recent updates, and not saying I for like them...but I do agree with the people on here that are saying all the problems with the bugs and the glitches. It has happened to me before, numerous times. After a while...it starts to really get on your nerves, that all your hard work and your items are all the sudden gone. I still have fun and enjoy playing this game with my buds and my sibling, but it's just almost not fun anymore when you know that there is the major risk that all the work you are doing in that world may potentially be erased the second you log out. I have had some pretty good memories with this game when I was younger, and I want other kids to be able to enjoy it without the annoyance of bugs/glitches, or the worry about the possibility that your work... Or even your world may be erased. I will give you a five star review because despite all the glitches & bugs... I still love the game.

4,2020-09-13 15:58:11,"I love Minecraft, I really do. I’ve played this game while I was still in grade school and have recently played the PS4 version of this game. Controls may be a bit hard to master, but nothing a few adjustments in settings can’t fix. My real problem with this games is that I may have missed a description in an update that changed the materials in crafting a furnace. For example, on one of my survival modes, the materials for crafting a furnace requires blackstone (which could only be found in the nether world). The PS4 version didn’t have that feature and neither did any other version have that feature. Heck, I am still playing this app after 10 years since I downloaded it and I was not fully aware of all the changes made to this game. I bring up the blackstone requirements for the furnace as it seems a little unfair to try and find the nether and get some blackstone to craft something that is destined for early game material. Now that I say that, how can I get to the nether if the furnace requires me to obtain blackstone? I’d have to craft a diamond pickaxe, sure, but the only way to obtain diamonds is by mining with an iron pickaxe (which you first mine iron ore and then smelt it in a furnace). If you can look into this issue as well, that would be great as I think it might be a glitch.",One tiny problem
5,2020-03-28 19:06:13,"I’ve been playing Minecraft since I was 3. So, that’s about seven years! I got PE a year ago for my birthday, and let me tell you, I can’t stop playing it! I have a world where it’s just command blocks with random but cool commands, it’s so fun! But I think most people can agree with me when I say I don’t really like the bee update. I do miss my old, nostalgic Minecraft, not gonna lie. Maybe you guys should add cave updates??? I mean, that’s what the people want :). Also another random thing, I think you should add different weather, like tornados, and hurricanes, and the villagers would kinda freak out when one was coming. It could give you a notification on what it is and what strength it’s at. And maybe more faces for snowmen? Like, you know when you sheer the pumpkin of the golem it would have different expressions. Like a happy face, or meh face, surprised face, I think you get the point. One last thing - cars and guns. I think adding cars and guns would make the game more interesting, guns for more combat ideas and games and cars for driving in large maps in cities and stuff like that. I have a car mod, it’s really laggy though. So maybe some cars and guns?  Overall, this is probably the absolute best game I’ve ever played!",Da best game for centuries!!
5,2019-04-02 14:41:39,"Minecraft is truly a game of failure, which helps us grow and get better at things. The game is really a awesome joy to play, especially when you are attempting to find diamonds, catch some fish, and tame wolves. But I think they should add more. I feel like with all the things and items Minecraft has put into the game, they should add more animals. Biomes like the desert and the acacia forest do not have many animals, besides the bad mobs that spawn at night, do not originate in those biomes. For example, you might be able to put zebras in the acacia forest, or elephants in the desert which you could ride and tame. I also think it would be an awesome idea to add TOUCANS into the game, maybe in the jungles. You should add more dimensions into the game also: maybe the CANDY DIMENSION or other things, because sometimes when you explore the nether and the ender dragon places a lot, you start to get a little bit bored. You could probably add more things to do in the nether except looking for fortresses. Also, you can not put leashes on Pandas for whatever reason, which I think is a bug. I know that was a lot to say, but other than those things you should add, Minecraft is a very good game.","It is awesome, and I think they should add more to get more people to play it!"

They're NOT THERE! So please please tell me what's wrong! Next, there should be new bricks. Like fire or water(well actually once I was living in the ocean and a wither then exploded then I looked in my inventory and I had water.) the new coral is cool.

And if you add those tell me please. Next, new mobs. It would be awesome if you added new mobs like eagles and whales and new monsters please add a were wolf!(wolves are my fav animal so i want WERE wolves but it's cool that there are WOLVES.) Next, it would be awesome if you could get stuff from the shop for FREE! And if not, you should make it so you get mine coins from achievements. Next, you should have updates sooner!

5,2023-06-29 07:16:59,I got this game in may of 2022 because I was bored and this game seemed fun. I built a city and lots of cool things. I could build endless things and make whatever my mind pleased. I woke up one day and was gonna get on the app as I always did. But this time there was 2 app icons on my screen both reading Minecraft. They were the same app. They were both connected they both were logged into my account both of them were identical. The only thing is there was 2 icons for the app. So I tried to delete 1 thinking 1 would still remain. Unfortunately I was wrong. It deleted both apps and all my worlds. I was unaware this would occur. I was very upset at the mistake I had made. So now you know if you ever find 2 Minecraft app icons on your screen leave both of them alone don’t try deleting either of them because then all your progress will be deleted from the app and you will have nothing left. I definitely learned from this mistake and won’t let it happen again. But overall this app was fun and I definitely recommend playing I think you’ll really enjoy it because I certainly did and made lots of cool builds.,If 2 icons pop up for the app don’t delete either of them!

But it allowed me to play 1.16 so who cares. But while I was getting MHA skins, my dad was planning on giving me his PS4. So on my 9th birthday, I had it, my first PS4. And, it came with Minecraft Bedrock (don't judge me Java's) and those PS Store things. I got Marketplace maps and got quite a cool skin. But it was just the beginning. On my 10th birthday I got this iPad and bought Minecraft a few weeks later. To this day I am still playing MinecraftPE.  Time for the review part of my REVIEW. It worked, and was better than EduEdition, but I prefer Bedrock. It worked and if this is the first time playing Minecraft and you're looking at the reviews, here is my review on the actual game. It did not have any annoying glitches. It can be both a digital sandbox or… the best survival game you have ever played. And you have to defeat the Ender Dragon!? This game is amazing!

4,2021-02-01 21:24:07,"I know lots of people say stuff like “Oh I saw something strange!” Just to start drama, but I’m actually experiencing some pretty weird things. This just started happening about 3 months ago. So I’ll be playing, planting things or building a house and rain will start. Obviously, this is normal, but the next part really scared me. As soon as it started, my wolves in the game started howling and then I heard a noise. First, it was like a door slowly creeping open, and then I heard a noise that sounded like something they would put in a movie when something scary was about to happen. I got goosebumps, but then continued to play. Next, I started seeing things. First, it seemed like a lot of the lights in my treehouse were going missing, and I placed new ones, but they kept DISAPPEARING. I could just be seeing things, but a dark figure will also sometimes appear, and I believe it’s always there, and it takes away the lights so I can see it. Disturbing, right? Please tell me if anyone else is experiencing such things, because I would love to know. Other than the creepy things, the game is fun and entertaining, although it would be nice that if when you died two sheep, (ex. a blue and yellow one) the baby would come out green.

But there is one thing I want that u and ur crew are probably working really hard on all the time, new animals, I always thought of having waterfalls with white water from the water rapids coming out of the bottom, and salmon that jump out of the water and a grizzly bear can have a unique hunting style by catching them and stuff like that. I also like how you research real life animals behaviors and add it into the game like you did with the Fox. Another thing is I know u guys are still working on the mountain goats right now but I rly hope they come soon. And one more thing is that you guys said u won’t add sharks and endangered animals because you don’t want to encourage people to kill them when u literally added... polar bears, panda bears, dolphins, and bees. Again, I love Minecraft and hope to see more updates soon. I am very sorry if this review took too long but I hope the content creators see this.",More animals
5,2018-11-04 15:54:01,"I have a lot of ideas so I hope you add at least a couple of these ideas! I’m not allowed to have mods so whenever an update comes into Minecraft that’s like a mod, I get REALLY Exited! So sorry if some of these ideas feel like you basically downloading mods for all players! One, You should add shadows. And reflections. Whenever you walk up to a river or pond or space of water, you would see your reflection in it! There would be pretty shadows coming from mountains, trees, and other objects. Two, CARS PLEASE! I know your character has the running Ability, but why don’t you have cas for those who don’t have mash-up packs? Or really, just anyone? I feel like it would be a faster way to get Around. Three, FURNITURE PLEASE!!! whenever I want to make a couch, I end up using giant blocks of wool that take up most of my house! You should also add WORKING TELEVISION! Four, we need more breeds of dogs. But a breed of dog I would personally love would be the CORGI! 😇 they’re so cute! My final idea is that you should add backpacks or bags! I know we have inventories, but I think using backpacks would WOW some people and take Minecraft to the next level! So thanks for reading my feedback, I hope you add some of these. It would make me SUPER HAPPY! thanks!","Ideas, Ideas, Ideas!"
5,2023-09-17 17:32:23,"So, Mojang. 1.20 just came out a month ago and I’m loving it! But I have some mob ideas for 1.21 and I want to share them with you. 1. Flamingo. A flamingo will spawn in the desert and you can saddle them like a horse. I thought of this because there are almost no pink mobs in Minecraft and I want more variety. 2. Penguin. A penguin will spawn in the snow biome and if you tame it with fish, it can catch fish for you. 3. Sharks. The shark will be a hostile mob and can pull you underwater if close. Since it’s a hostile mob, it cannot be in peaceful. I just wanted more creatures of the deep in Minecraft. 4. Butterflies. The butterflies can either come in one color, or many different colors. Your choice, honestly. The butterflies collect pollen just like bees because they are pollinators in real life too. And they can all huddle up together when in the snow biome. And lastly, Hamsters. Hamsters can have their own item, like a hamster ball maybe. And you could craft it. Plus, I think it would make for a great new pet. I really hope you see this Mojang, and have a good day. Anyone who is reading this and wants more cool mobs, write your own review. And who knows? Maybe one day they’ll finally stop being stubborn and add more mobs. Bye! :)",Mob ideas for Mojang :)

I love minecraft it’s just when I saw the update and all the new stuff I started getting upset about the stuff it mentioned in the pop up for the update I miss the old minecraft please some of it back not complaing about the new stuff I like it and all but I am starting to miss the old minecraft like I said I have been playing for 3 years I am a 9 year old girl going onto 10 so I am going to have this game for 4 years after this year which my birthday is in September which is close to the end of the year please bring some of the old stuff back and get rid of some of the new stuff like the ores some of them like the new type of the old ores it’s weird thank you if you took the time to read this thank you if you add some of the old stuff back. Thank for so much if you can!",I like it but
5,2019-11-27 17:58:30,"I love this game, don’t get me wrong, but there are a few things that would make the game more fun. First off, I’ve been waiting for years for Minecraft to add unicorns. I mean, who doesn’t like unicorns? I have seen many add ons for unicorns but none of them actually work. PLEASE ADD UNICORNS. Second, I the ender world, the dragon and ender men were all blue. Why is this? Please change all ender creatures back to black and purple. Another thing you should add to the game is taming ANY ANIMAL. In the game, you can game only few animals such as horses, wolves, and others. Please change this. We’ve seen the cats, we’ve seen the horses, but where are the DOGS? Minecraft would be a lot more fun with dogs. Lastly, I think you should delete the chat in servers. Now I know if anyone types a bad word, it shows up as a bunch of xs. But what a lot of people do is don’t spell them the right way, but still let people know what they are. Another reason is because there are many people who like to scare other people that are playing the game such as saying, “I know where you live,” or other creepy stuff that makes others scared. I know someone that stopped playing Minecraft because they were told something creepy in s server. Please delete the chat in servers!",Dear Mojang
5,2018-10-23 04:25:34,"Minecraft is a great game, and I highly recommend it for anyone who does not yet own it. I thought it might be a bad idea to get on the iPad, because I’ve played on a phone before, and it made me dizzy. Despite my former experience, it is actually really smooth gameplay for such a small device. It updates regularly, however, if I am not mistaken, there are no opportunities for mods, on my device, respectively.      Recently I discovered, to my pleasant surprise, that banners can be made just the same as those on computers, as far as I’ve seen.     Although I’ve personally never done any sort of programming before, I do believe that it would be rather difficult to respond to every single demand made to the makers of Minecraft. However, I do suggest one thing, that I think a few others who have played the game for a while might appreciate, and that is: when we hold torches in our hands, would it be possible that it could give off light? If not, I understand. It does give a kind of challenge to the players, but perhaps there could be a switch for it in settings. Anyhow, I would like to make it clear that this review is all to say how much I appreciate this game. If you ever read this, THANK YOU MOJANG!!!!!!","Thank you, Mojang!"
3,2018-09-14 01:36:38,"For your next few updates you should definitely do Halloween Christmas phones new mobs curtains and etc. what I mean by that is make furniture and technechly house things and other foods. Also make more animals and mobs. And make cool worlds free!! Also plz plz plz!! Bring herobrian back!! Also how do I get mine coins without having to pay real money?? I mean, why do you want real money for fake coins?? Biomes would be an improvement to. By making all these improvements, I think you might just get me to give you five stars. It will also feel like real life just even better. The aquatic version is fine but the next version should be called....... real life but better. Then pretty much everyone should be giving you five stars. Consider me a genius. Jk!! Anywho Minecraft is a real hit to my family and improvements is gonna be awesome!!!!!!! Also make lags fixed because sometimes it lags and I’m on survival and a mob is hitting me. When it lags I die! And I have pretty good stuff on survival. Settings and all the regular stuff should be kept but make those improvements plz!,!,!,!       Sorry I’m making you read all this but it’s important to me and the following. Oh! You know what!!??

5,2019-11-03 21:05:49,"Hello. This is literally my favorite game in the world, not joking! Though, there are some things I don’t like, as well as an issue I don’t know how to do. Let’s start with the Character Creator. I hate it. You more than likely have to buy all the cool stuff, and you can only make cheap-looking characters. Also, here’s the question. How do you switch to a custom character made from another app-for example, Skinseed. Skinseed is an awesome app, made to make skins to share with others and they can play with it in game. I have lots of characters. I also don’t like the new part of the settings, when you go to put on a Behavior/Resource pack, it is a weird version where you have to click new buttons in order to do stuff. I really liked the old version better, where the only thing you had to press was the resource/behavior pack you wanted and pressed the check mark button, adding it into the game. I also have found a bug. Why is it when you put any LEATHER armor on an armor stand, it always reverts to a white color? (Not Iron, white leather armor.) Besides all these things, I LOVE the game, and will always. Keep on making great updates, Mojang, and thanks for reading this, viewer!","Awesome, but a few things I don’t really like..."
5,2020-06-23 22:32:31,"This game is amazing I have played since version 1.0 or something like that, I like the new updates and the cross play for bedrock. But there are some things I find frustrating. The hunger bar for bedrock edition is much different from the java edition. The bedrock hunger bar wastes much faster than on java which is frustrating because we have to keep looking for food all the time because it gets wasted way too quick, another thing I don’t like is that fall damage is a little increased, or so I feel it that way, I sometimes fall 3 blocks and get half a heart off and I see these pros in java edition doing crazy jumps and falls without getting dealt fall damage. Also this problem I’m about to say is not with mobile but in the Xbox one edition of Minecraft it was much easier to land a water bucket without taking damage because you missed it, in the bedrock Xbox one edition, the water bucket is way too sensitive, I literally press the trigger once and the water is placed and collected almost at the same time, it made it harder for me to land water buckets which comes in handy especially when fighting the ender dragon, I’m a little used to it now but it is still pretty hard.

But the day after you sent the new update me and my stepbrother had a bad bug in the game if you can please fix any more bugs . This app is cool but I wish there were more animals like lions, Mice and mostly any other animals . I’d also like if you could add cars to ride ,horses are nice and stuff but when you’re building a modern house cars are very useful. Another wish of mine is that you can add unicorns  and  dragons and hopefully you can tame them both like you can with dogs and cats . I also would like if you would add more mobs and more portals, I have defeated the end and nether meany times please add stronger bosses to . It would also be cool to add money because everyone loves money. I can’t wait for the new acoustic update to come out please make it possible to ride dolphins and feed them.

But I stopped playing for a while 3-5 months, half by choice half not by choice,( strict rules that are easily broken.) anyway past that me and my s/o wanted to play Minecraft, they wanted help with their Chinese styled garden:), we I tried to open the app (im a iOS user, iPhone 13, fully updated both phone and Minecraft, backup my phone, etc) it glitches out on my and closes the app, I know its not a storage problem bc I have a lot of strange left (around 30MB) and it’s not that the app isn’t updated bc I updated it, I also tired uninstalling it and reinstalling it, still didn’t work. So everytime I want to play it doesn’t let me and keeps glitching out and then closes the app. It’s getting annoying and it’s been happening for the past 4 days :[. I’d like help with this please :] Other then that it’s a good game and I enjoy playing it along with the freedom within building :] I’ve had great times playing with my friends and messing around in their worlds and etc, i took away two stars just because of the issues, if it wasn’t for that Iwould’ve  given 4 stars, not 5 b/c it’s not my main-to-go game, it used to but I enjoyed it for free time :)","Problems with opening, help please?"
3,2020-06-26 06:43:36,"I’ve been playing since I was 3 first on the iPad mini 1 then on the Wii U now on the iPad mini 4. I took a break though for almost 2 years because all of a sudden one day Microsoft just bought it and swooped in changing the entire game like accounts I used to just have a Minecraft account now I have to play with the Microsoft account the reason this is a problem is because it often causes problems yes it can be helpful when playing with friends and just syncing it in. But, it also causes lag sometimes problems connecting and my friend thought it was funny to go on my iPad while I was sleeping change my entire account name and everything and now it costs money to change my name back. I think it’s stupid that Microsoft is making Minecraft entirely meant for Xbox users only which is unfair to people who don’t have Xbox’s or computer that just run it if I did I’d just use that but I don’t I think they should change the fact that it’s basically becoming a exclusive game instead of a all time favorite game. And the intro has all that crazy red-stone It takes years to master that I’m really good with red-stone and I could never make that and half the intros in the past 2 years for red-stone don’t work on bedrock edition so mobile which is stupid.",Why I like it but it can be annoying
4,2022-05-22 02:53:42,"Kinda weird and annoying. when I first joined I was really confused but my friends helped me out. I made and acc and everything went great. Until I randomly got logged out. I decided to try logging in but that didn’t work. Made a new acc. Again same story. Now I got really mad. I had to keep redownloading the app. 3rd time it happened was today. I’m gonna try redownloading it. But if it does this again I’m reporting this to the owner (if I can) if you see this, just so you know. I’m not trying to hate or anything on the game. I’m just saying what happened to me on the game. The overall game is amazing. Exploring new worlds and stuff but. The thing is, most worlds you have to buy with coins. And with coins comes real life money. Now I don’t get allowance because I have my own bank account. Money goes in there but I can’t use it.( I’m 10 years old btw) it is collage money. My sister also has it. (She is 6.) Now I had an iPad. My dad lost it. Me and my sister shared it and played Minecraft on there. Tbh I like it better on a bigger screen but on a phone it’s better.

Personally I like creative better so I can just have fun and explore with my building, but I’ve heard a lot of people also really enjoy survival.  And I’m sorry to bring it up but there was one thing I wanted to mention. So since I really like to build and explore, on a lot of my worlds I like to build barns to keep my horses in, but almost every time I leave the world and come back, I find that one of my horses have gone missing!!! What’s happening!? Also just a few more comments..... first off, I think it would be cool that when you turn wolves into dogs, the dogs could kinda vary of what colors and things they come out as like the cats. Plus I’ve been having a problem where my game is like never letting me feed any animals which is annoying, and lastly think it would be cool if the trap doors could maybe fold in different directions when you put them on walls, cause i would like to use them for cupboards and things but as of now that’s now possible...

5,2019-04-10 22:51:29,"Can you add a few things I had in mind? I was thinking maybe to make things harder on hard mode you can add a solar eclipse, and demons. Demons could be as powerful as a blaze and Skelton combined, and can shoot really powerful fire balls. I was  also thinking demons can only spawn in the nether, but when it become a solar eclipse demons can spawn in the world. Also I was thinking that some demons could have voodoo dolls, if you kill these demons it gives the voodoo doll. If you throw the voodoo doll in water or lava it summons the devil witch is  as powerful as 100 demons combined. Also you could add new weapons, such as the Hell Sword, which does 12 damage plus enchantments, and a Hell Bow and Crossbow. The Hell sword, Crossbow, and Bow can be MADE in peaceful, easy, and normal mode but instead of wood diamond or sticks they are made with nether blocks, but ONLY in those modes. I was also thinking of a new enchantment called fire ball which a demon drops, the fire ball enchantment lets you shoot fire balls out of your Hell Sword when attacking. The only way to get Hell swords, Bows, and Crossbows is to find it in the in the demons base in HARD mode which is somewhere in the nether. Those are my suggestions.  Plz make this update, it would be called ""the nether update.""",Plz read Minecraft owners

Day one : everything went smooth no toxic players or anyways just a classic rage of losing a few tommy innit screams but nothing that bad. Half of day two : same thing but with no tommy innit screaming since I was with my mom and she’d take away ipad if a screamed since we were outside the house, inside the car. Rest a day two : once i opened Minecraft I was.. kicked out of my, account no message or anything I was banned or anything just.. kicked out, I forgot my password so I had to make a new one I didn’t mind but something happened, it made me a Microsoft account but not for Minecraft, for real Microsoft, i ask my friend what to do when it happened again on my second attempt she said “press close, I don’t know what to do” mojang, I would like it if you fix it.",Worth the 5.99$ or 6.00$ but just a problem
1,2022-02-21 17:09:58,"With such a hi-tech game, you would think when you create an account what is in it would be yours… that is one of the biggest points of creating an account. My daughter purchased and created an account but unfortunately We had to delete the app and repurchase Minecraft all over again because it wasn’t allowing her to purchase Minecraft bucks… When doing so, we went into her account where it would be expected that everything she owned and created should be in there but it wasn’t…all her worlds were gone but her characters were still there. All her hard work and money she vested in the game now gone… why do you have people make accounts if they cannot even retrieve what they created. Isn’t that the point of creating an account? The odd thing is her iPod still has her worlds so how does one device have it and the other device not but both are signed into the same log in?  I tried contacting Minecraft and I was told this may be a glitch and there is nothing they can do. It was suggested I reach out to the community for Support. Your telling me that Minecraft staff cannot help with the money they make but the community may have a suggestion??? Doesn’t make sense.

Please also the grass is made out of wool and the tree leaves are pink and light blue bubblegum and the sky has lots of clouds and then the final suggestions are mobs can you add 2 new mobs that can be pets that are described like this the 1st one is the puffsugi also (these creatures are not real life) so the puffsugi is a teddy bear like creature that is in the cloud biome with white fur and wings on his back that contain poison that can poison you if you don’t tame it with cake and if you kill it it will drop white wool and string the other one is the is the unicorn which can only be tamed with bubblegum leaves and if you kill it it will drop a brand new item a fairy shard also add a Cerberus that is a new wolf type that guards the Pegasus until you defeat it and after that there scattered all over the could biome and yes you can tame it with bones and if you kill it they drop a new item the soul and the rest of the stuff from the mobs to the the new blocks found there Mojang can decide so have a jolly blessed day.,GREAT!!

Also where is the world border and the /worldborder command? I know we have the farlands but not the world border also being able to dye leather armor with a crafting table in Java you cannot use a cauldron but in Pocket/Bedrock you can!

I tried playing with it until it really made the game not fun and just made me mad. I exited out of all apps and tabs i had open and completely shut of my phone once my phone turned back on i re entered my world and the same thing was happening. It made the game completely unfun and just simply made me not want to play it. I deleted the app and reinstalled it. When i logged back into my microsoft account was when I ran into another problem, it would not let me back into my account, it could just be a problem on my end but i’m pretty sure it should allow me back in. The second thing was that when I gave up on my microsoft account and just played without one, i started a new world and the same problem was happening. I could not sprint and drag my hand to destroy blocks fast, it was like I was in survival and not using a shovel while in creative.

Make customizable skins easier like a create a character thing so you can choose your hair style or clothes. And add a new mode. Which can be called Epic mode.

5,2022-05-16 22:27:37,"So I LOVE Minecraft because it is a great game and is suitable for all ages, but there are some things I want to say. I think it’s weird how when you ride an animal such as a horse or a donkey, your head sticks into the block above your head(if you are under a block that is up to 3 blocks above the animal) and you suffocate. PLEASE FIX THIS BUG!!!!! I also have two problems about the animals. #1 is an easy fix. The animals are HOLLOW and when you shove up against them you can see INSIDE them. It’s kinda creepy. #2 is something that would make Minecraft undergo some changes that would turn it into Minecraft 2.0 and not the original Minecraft we all love. But I’ll say it anyway. So Minecraft has all these basic animals like cows, pigs and bees. But then you have things like the ocelot, which is something that not all people even KNOW about. So what I’m kinda saying is some of these animals should be turned into more popular animals. For example, instead of the ocelot, we could have a leopard, or instead of silverfish an ant.

First, why does emerald armor or sword, pickaxe, axe, shovel, or hoe and golem not exist in the game (unless you use mods or add ons) a reason why I’m asking this is that emeralds are the hardest to find and yet the almost hold no purpose the only things they are used for are certain villager trades, and to make emerald blocks for building. Second, why is there only one type of golem, the iron golem, but why is there no diamond golem or gold golem or emerald golem or even lapis golem. Third, why is there only three bosses in the game (Wither, Elder Guardian, and Ender Dragon)  why can’t there be a fourth boss , a PILLAGER BOSS he or she could be part of the final wave when pillagers raid a village and it could be could the PILLAGER CAPTAIN or the PILLAGER LEADER or PILLAGER GENERAL. I think it would go really well with the pillager update. Finally, I think there should be more weapons, and I am not talking about guns or bazookas or tanks. I am talking about old school maces, daggers, battle axes, and spears.

5,2021-10-30 01:22:44,"This game is... it’s... well... how do you explain Minecraft? It’s so exceedingly simple and so very, very complicated and... it’s Minecraft man. Basically, it’s a block game. And, as someone who has dabbled in coding (very, very, very, very basic dabbling) you can tell that the developers put a lot of work and a lot of love into this game. It’s so smooth, so slick. It regularly gets updated, so you always have mere things to play with, but beyond that, it’s like Legos. If you have six 2*4 Lego bricks, there are 915,103,765 combinations. This is how Minecraft is. Given fifteen random blocks, you can make an house, or a model spaceship, or a city layout, or a forest. But Minecraft isn’t just a game. Yes the thing you will buy if you do choose to is a game, but Minecraft is more than that. It’s a community, an entire micro culture. There are all sorts of people in it, and it is wonderful.  As for pocket edition itself, it’s amazing. I am by no means a veteran player, I’ve only been playing for… 4-6 years now? Let’s see, when I first joined, the nether was in pocket but the wither wasn’t, and we didn’t have concrete. And the game has grown since then, until now we are almost in parity with Java",An excellent game
5,2020-06-09 10:08:34,"Now don’t get me wrong, this game is my favorite game of all time. I’ve been playing it for years! It’s been so long, that the new stuff has gotten boring. Exploring the end to get the best stuff in the game, it’s sort of like trying to explore a large, empty room. It’s just a lot of nothing until you find an end city, which also gets pretty boring after a while. What I would like to see, especially after the nether update, is an end update. This could add a new biome, sort of like a mushroom island biome, where it would be kinds greener than everywhere else. It could hold a green wood and log. It would have new leaves too, but if you broke it, it would give you everything it would normally drop, except saplings, therefore limited. It would be cool to have a new mob too, but it wouldn’t need to be a food source. Maybe a ghost that can’t be damaged, but would attack you if it saw you holding a weapon or wearing armor. The biome could even have a new ore, but can’t be found on the surface.  All I’m saying is, it would be great to have something to explore, even live in in an end hardcore series. Minecraft is a great game, just make sure it doesn’t get boring late game. Anyway, thanks for reading my idea!",Boring.
5,2018-12-08 22:19:28,"It’s a really good game but I have a lot of suggestions #1 add more life to swamp biomes, caves, deserts, savanahs, maybe for swamp biomes you can add crocodiles and snakes and frogs and for desserts maybe meercats scorpions and more cactuses and desert plants and for Savanahs you should add termites ostritches and maybe some type of tree. #2 make a new feature for pets and make wolfs and dogs their own mob and have more dog types and maybe add like dog buiscuts dog treats dog food dog toys and for cats cat treats cat food cat toys and make it so pets have a option to stay at home. #3 add cherry trees and more flowers and plants and add more animals like foxes, pandas, maybe stray cats and stray dogs, bears, ants, bees, butterflies, flies, #4 add more stuff to caves maybe like cave mushrooms or glow in the dark mushrooms or new ores or somthing like that. #5 maybe add new biomes like a red desert or black desert or somthing or maybe a cherry tree biome, #6 make it so some monsters only attack you if you attack them #7 last suggestion add a few more dimensions maybe a twilight dimension a forest dimension a ocean dimension and make each one have a boss like for the ocean one maybe a megladon or a sea serpent for the twilight one maybe some sort of giant snake thing for the forest dimension maybe a giant fox boss.",It’s a good game
5,2022-12-31 02:16:20,"This game is incredible! It’s so much fun but there are a few things I would like to recommend! I’ve played MineCraft for several years and I have gotten my little sister into it. She is only 6 and wanted to play with monsters on, she I did so and made it easy. She played for a while but got quite mad because she couldn’t kill a creeper. I think you should have a place when you are creating a new world say something like “Mobs” then you can click it. On that tab it should show all the mobs and you can click the ones you don’t want on your world. For example: My little sister could create a new world and go to “Mobs.” She could scroll through all the mobs and find creeper. She could click it then it removes all creepers. But let’s say she spawns a creeper on her world. It should be able to spawn, but once she leaves all the creepers she would have spawned disappear. That’s just an idea that you don’t have to use, but me and probably some others would enjoy if you do that. MineCraft is just a wonderful game so thank you Mojang for working so hard on it! I can tell lots of love and hard work was put into this game! Thank you all! 😊😊😊",Incredible!

To start just casually playing and enjoying the game and I have to get off for a split second to do something and when i get back on the sound completely goes away, second invisible mobs?! I was playing a new survival world and killing zombies from a spawner in a cave right next to where I was crafting some things, out of nowhere I get attacked, thinking I was probably crafting too long and just forgot to check if anything was sneaking up on me i turn around and see two zombies approaching, no big deal I take care of them and I get attacked again and turn around and see nothing, I was confused and checked for any zombies but there was nothing to be seen and i kept being attacked and backed into a corner and got killed. Of course I was a little angry and went back for my things but all that was left out of my entire inventory was my armor almost all broken when before it was all at least above half and immediately i got attacked again and killed two times after.

3,2019-01-02 00:32:02,"This game, is literally filled with memories. I have been playing this game since I was 4, and, once I looked at my old world, and memories flowed through my brain, Remembered everything. It brought tears to my eyes. But, it also brought tears to my eyes when there was a glitch. Which caused a lot of personal anger, and disappointment. So, I was playing and all of a sudden, when I was walking forward, and it wouldn't let me move, it was like, when you make a new world, you can make it infinite, flat, or old, it was like it cut the world off. But, when I went towards the glitch but went left or right, and kept going... going... going.  And literally 2 minutes later, the lag would ""end"" and I could go forward on my horse again. It was like there was invisible blocks that kept going and going and going and going. This was really disappointing, and it really upsetted me when I was playing with my cousins and I kept having to log off and on and it was so weird, the glitch/lag LITERALLY moved to a different spot, I made this fence, and it went there, then there was one at the mountain river, then, at he front of my barn, then, left of the mini barn, then, literally ALL around my whole acre of barn land for my horses, this was super upsetting, can you guys fix this for the next bug update?

4,2019-10-31 21:02:39,"I've had minecraft since for almost 7 years, I have nothing agaist this game, but slowly over time, minecraft (specifically pocket edition) has become more and more attached to internet connection. I like to play on airplane mode a lot, no internet, less things downloading, more memory. It wasn't much of a problem at first, like a crash or two, I can handle that. Now though, this is a whole new problem. It is completely impossible to play minecraft pocket edition without a connection. I'm not talking about multiplayer, I'm not that stupid, just anything at all. I start up minecraft on airplane mode so I can play on one of my singleplayer worlds, but not even three seconds after I see the menu, it still tries to connect to my Microsoft account, which of course crashes because there's no connection. I can't play on trips now, at places without connection, or anywhere this isn't free wifi. I 've tried starting minecraft without connection countless times, all of them crashed. It's not airplane mode, I've done this with just wifi off too, still the same results. I still have not found a fix to this.

5,2018-05-13 23:34:45,"Ok I have some ideas for the world “City Life” . First of all pets. Mostly dogs. Ok for the dogs I think it would be awsome if when you went up to a tamed dog there would be three buttons: sit, stand,, follow, stay,, and the last one: trick, in trick your dog would do a random trick like sit up, lay down, or play dead. Maybe there could be different dog skins where maybe different kinds of taming foods make different kinds of dogs. Ok on to cats, the only thing I really want for the cats is a follow/ stay button and a dyeable collar. And more city type animals, birds, the occasional deer, and maybe strays. Ok moving out of the animals, I would practically die if y’all added stuff like TVs that you could tap to turn on random stuff, sinks, showers,   tubs, and dishwashers you could tap to turn on, dishes, glasses (as in cups) refrigerators and shelves that you could store and place items on, maybe sofas, and chairs you could really sit on, tables and many more things we have in modern times y’all really need to add to city life. You could really get more money from people buying minecoins to get city life. I am so sorry about all the things I want you to add but if you could add these I would buy City Life again.

5,2017-10-08 13:33:01,"Ok I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Especially the new update. But with big updates there comes bugs, am I right? And I have found a REALLY ANNOYING ONE!!! So you know the signs? (I will describe the problem with me as an example lol) So I placed a sign on the wall, and I type (I have an iPad, FYI) normally you don't hit return now (before you had to hit return, it could not do it for you) well it goes to the next line and the X (exit) button in the top right corner it goes up, (my thought process) *ok let me test this out, keeps typing till it's the last line* WHERE DID THE X BUTTON GO!!!! (It went off the screen...) There is no way to exit... my face= 😡😰😢🤧 You can exit typing, but you can't exit the sign viewpoint. UNLESS, you hit the home button twice and fully exit out of Minecraft and go back on. Please fix this!!! I tried to describe every little detail even if it's common sense, because you know, *support* NEEDS MOST DETAIL AS POSSIBLE... Also I gave you 5 stars because the game overall is AMAZING and 1 minor bug doesn't have to squash 1 star ⭐️ and leave 4 stars so....

5,2022-08-10 16:14:14,"I’ve been playing minecraft since i was very little and i love all the new updates constantly coming out! however i have some suggestions for future updates. -more stair and slab textures -more transparent glass -maybe rename the walls, and create a new block that comes in many different textures and is flat, so for example you could make a wooden house but have a brick wall on the inside while only having one layer of blocks. -maybe add some new dog breeds (german shepherd, husky, Australian shepherd, etc) like you did with transferring ocelots to cats -more bugs? like flies, ants, things like that. frogs could eat them -make it so when you kill a mob, their corpse is still on the ground and doesn’t disappear. it would be pretty cool -maybe more crops and food? you could add some new foods such as peaches, bananas, blackberries, strawberries, rice, pancakes, being able to cook eggs and eat them (new trees/seeds/bushes for the food that grows on trees ofc) i hope you consider some of these! it would be amazing:) especially the dog breeds. also for minecraft mobile it would be awesome if you added a joystick instead of the weird arrows. they’re really difficult to use",suggestions!
5,2020-06-15 18:05:27,"I'm usually pretty picky when it comes to games. In my life, I've downloaded more than a 100,000 of them, but only five of them still remain in the games folder. One of them was Minecraft, because 1. it was easy to understand 2. I could build anything I wanted 3. you can play multiplayer 4. there are always updates and plus there‘s the nether and the end 5. it never gets boring because you can always make new worlds and worlds never end 6. there is no stupid 'Coming soon' sign to agitate you 7. there's so much to explore and billions of interesting seeds to spawn in. My advice before buying this game: don't worry too much about the price tag. Just make worlds and have fun!  Edit: Ok. So before, I said that Minecraft was a pretty good game in general, but lately, I've been running into a problem. As soon as I spawn in a village, there are plenty of villagers. But in a week or two, they all disappear like magic. This kind of gives off a spooky vibe, and I don't know how it happens, so please fix it.

4,2022-06-29 22:50:29,"Minecraft is like a supernatural version of real life. With zombies, creepers, skeletons, unlimited building material (In Creative at least), and SO much more, Minecraft is an amazing game. I was young when it became popular, but I couldn’t get it on my device because it cost money and I couldn’t get my parents to let me spend my savings on it, but once I finally got (Even though Fortnite was the new trend) I still LOVED it.      The best part about Minecraft, is that, you can’t lose. At all. Just reset your spawn point wherever you’re building and click keep inventory. Then, you lose nothing. The part that I don’t like, is the when you’re off WiFi, or internet, it take FOREVER to load. Also, I feel that there should be more free mods, skin packs, or even textures. If you’re like me, and you don’t want to spend any money, your choices are limited when it comes to that stuff. Another thing, I feel the in survival, for someone who is just starting, it would be hard to find out how to craft items. I guess if you start out in creative you don’t have to worry, but still. But, all in all,Minecraft is still a pretty awesome app. And it’s the reasons above why I I don’t give it five stars.",I Really Enjoy Playing It!!!

It was breathtaking, being my first interaction with a video game, to see how few limitations existed in the virtual world. I dreamt of living in Minecraft, for months, until I was finally allowed to purchase it. I played long after every one of my friends left the game, eventually moving on to other games and such. But one day, years after I started, I walked away, just as my friends had. Since then, I have wavered, leaving and returning to that magical place where I spent my childhood, a blocky world outside my own. But every time I returned, I found “infinite wonders, endless possibilities,” waiting for me, each time, every time. I found that no matter how dusty a gem becomes, no matter how coated and greased, there will always be a dazzling diamond waiting underneath the veneer.       I need to thank the developers and virtual architects that crafted such a wonder.

I absolutely loved it and then i heard two more pieces of underwater music, and then I realized that new music had been added, underwater music. I was enthralled by this, they became my new favorite pieces of minecraft music ever. I would get entranced by them and feel like i was in another world of beauty and wonder. It became the main reason why i continued to play minecraft, it brought so much happiness to me. But then, one day when i went for a swim, the music did not play, instead it was the normal music that plays on land. I was confused at first so i went for another swim, it still didn’t play, and then I realized to my shock that the music had been removed. I was so upset and disappointed by this, and since then i have played minecraft less and less, sometimes even forgetting it exists.

Minecraft is the best game in the universe. I love it so much I’ve had it for at least 3 years!!!!! Anyways you should get this game and it will cure your boredom!! The second reason I love Minecraft is because of all the animals I really really like all of the animals in Minecraft!!!!! And then the third reason I LOVE Minecraft is because you can play with whoever you want! That means people you do and don’t know but you do have to sign in to be able to play with the people that you don’t know. Those are all the reasons I LOVE Minecraft. But… I do have one suggestion.. could you please add more animals!!??!! Like for example… deer, bears 🐻, snakes, koalas, sloths, and more wild animals please! I really like the animals!!

You need more than you can fit in your inventory and all you have is a horse   what do you do??? And that is my reason why I want wagons and carriages!!! One more thing is that there is more stuff to do with your dog: so what you tame a wolf you get a type of dog and not a grey wolf, like the cat. Also what about backpacks I mean I take a backpack everywhere I travel and I can hold a lot of stuff in them and when I travel in Minecraft I fell like I am traveling in real life and I don’t have a backpack.

Also there are some bugs... like I am playing on Xbox live and then I go off WiFi then get back on it.. IT FORGETS  MY PASSWORD THEN WOUNT LET ME SIGN BACK IN!!!! I hate this.

Can the iPad have more optimization? Listen the new iPads are coming out with 120hz displays and MCPE has 60hz support only, it would only make sense to optimize hardware that can support 120hz. This is not yet a feature to this day and not to mention how many bugs there are on iPadOS. A few examples can be noticeable delay with controller support, a bug where the game drops your items randomly without using the touch screen, and more. I just ask and beg that iPads get more optimization in the future because the iPads have various bugs in the game compared to iPhones. iPads also have amazing hardware that isn’t being used to the fullest. Not only this being the issue, but ever since these new updates roll out the performance got way worse, but as soon as i boot up the game on a weak PC it runs SMOOTHLY? Which should absolutely not be happening considering the hardware is over 4 times better than this PC. Just really request some more attention towards iPadOS optimization.

And for parents that are reading this it is so fun for kids and you parents too. You can play on server’s but you need to sign in to a Minecrosoft account so if you don’t want your kids to play on a server’s you don’t have to sign in. I have to say I am a little anointed that thay have Minecons. Minecons is a sort of money in the Minecraft Marketplace and there’s some free things on the Marketplace to. In Minecraft there’s something called skins. Skins are a thing kind of like clothes but you can change it if you want so you can look like a cat a fox a rockstar and a mermaid. If you would want to know what your kids play in Minecraft you can get Minecraft and play with them. The big part of Minecraft is that you can create your own world’s that you can play in and you can join our kids world. Only if you are on your internet server you can join world’s if you’re kids have thare own server then everyone can join not just on your internet.

Minecraft is basically a baseplate or something similar to let anybody’s ideas range from a modern house, to a TNT cannon launcher. Anyways, Minecraft is awesome.

Not much is bad with Minecraft. Although, I do have a couple suggestions. Please bring back capes. Those were an amazing hit to the game and I currently have the Enderman cape, although I hope you bring in some new and unique capes. Also, everybody begs for it and I am most likely sure that you read them. Cave updates. We need them, even a few new cave mobs or at least some new cave sound effects, it would reel in more people. Finally, I don’t know why, but for some reason, I got disconnected from all the servers such as Hypixel and such. So I suggest that you could add Hypixel as a starter public server or something similar. Other than that, Minecraft will always have respect in my heart. Peace!",Amazing but a few touch ups

I have to agree with MincraftLover that Minecraft has changed much, and I do sometimes miss the old Minecraft, but sometimes I like the lanterns and looms too (not that I’m that far into survival yet). But, to anyone looking to buy the game I completely recommend it, as it is a game like no other and more than worth whatever money you spend on buying it. Though, I do recommend getting used to the controls in creative and even getting I guide Book to help. Personally I have Mega Builder from 2016 and three years later I’m still going strong with it (I’ll get a new one eventually, maybe next year). All in all I think I’ll let Minecraft keep going as it changes and adapt instead of repel it. Anyways, get and play Minecraft. It is an experience of a lifetime.

3,2018-05-03 15:36:27,"I have played this game on my iPad mini 1st generation since the alpha and beta and it has ran smoothly. Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally. I think the last one is the main reason for a lot of issues aside from sound effects.",Bugged to Hell and Back

I bought a new texture pack in the marketplace, and it’s been on the downloading screen for a while now with no progress. Just like several others worlds and texture packs I’ve bought it’s stuck on that screen and will probably be there for months like the rest of them. Is there a storage problem? Do I need to delete some of my worlds to let it download? Is there a way to get these packs to stop downloading, so I can retry the ones that I really want? If there’s a way, please give it to me, because knowing I wasted money and can’t use the texture pack I really want is just insult to injury.   I’m sure there’s a simple method to get around this, so I’m very glad to give this game a positive review.

3,2023-10-11 22:57:30,"So I been playing this game for quite a bit and there haven’t been really anything new except the new sniffers update and that update came up late on my device, so I know the sniffer is painfully cute but can you add other mobs? Like the squirrel, so it would be fun to add squirrels because it would be fun, so can you make it so you can tame squirrels if you add them? So if you do can you olso make it so you tame the squirrel with acorns with acorn trees? So a acorn tree can you make it so you don’t have too chop the tree and you just have too pick the acorn from the ground or on the tree? Olso can you make it so when you tame a doggo you can change it into a breed of dog and you can choose the breed, so for example, a corgi. Okay now can you olso make it so when you drop a idem it’s more realistic and can you make it so you need to punch the idem in order to put it in your inventory? Olso can you make it so the idem can just stay there forever when it is on the ground and not disappear? Another thing, can you make it so you can like invent stuff? Like I know the chance of you is basically 99% no but what if you had to pay to make something? Like a cupcake! Or a flag for your city! So I think that’s all I’m going to say, so bye! Thanks for reading this review.","Squirrels,nuts, and other"
4,2019-08-13 00:20:51,"the game is good and the environment looks more alive now in the recent updates, but whenever i look up in the sky there is something missing, the sky looks dead but the ground looks alive, and i know exactly what would fox this problem, more birds, birds that actually fly in flocks, birds like eagles, pigeon, and more, and each bird only spawns on biomes like foxes and pandas, so everytime a player travels through sea and ground, they would have something to look at in the sky, i can only imagine looking up and then seeing an eagle soar though the air as i travel across mountains, and these birds would make nests and have eggs in it, like turtles, everytime you breed these birds they have to find a spot to make the nest and lay the eggs. And believe me, this would make the game look really, like REALLY alive, because we now have birds that actually fly in formation, and even travel long distances, like eagles, when added in the game eagles can be tamed like wolves, eagles can help you hunt down fast mobs, like rabbits, the eagle would actually chase them, and then hunt them down, this would really help minecraft grow more, please add this, it would be really appreciated, no need to thank me if this update gives you guys more profit :)",well i guess it's time to say my suggestion
5,2020-07-08 00:27:21,"I have been playing Minecraft for a while and absolutely LOVE it! I love that I can play with my friends. None of us live very close together so we normally get together on our Minecraft worlds. It is a very fun experience for me. I love building stuff. There are SO many different blocks to choose from in creative mode. I also like survival mode. I love playing with my friends in survival mode. The whole game was very well thought up and I 100% recommended it. There is so much stuff to explore and find in every Minecraft world you create! It is absolutely amazing!!!!!! I also love all the details put into the game. There are so many little things that make all the big things possible. I love that there is always a new adventure awaiting in every world. Whether it’s an ocean monument or a spooky mansion, there is always something new awaiting in each world! I love that you can customize your skin too! This game has become a part big part of my life in some ways, and I 100% recommended this to everyone! There are endless possibilities for imaginative minds! Let your creativity roam! This is my FAVORITE game in the world!!!!",Minecraft is 100% the BEST GAME EVER!!!
5,2020-01-18 20:53:34,"First let me say this is one of the brightest tier games you will ever play. I highly recommend the game and there is no reason not to get it. It holds adventures upon adventures and the game has so many things you can do, from taming a dog to trading with villagers to obtain a diamond sword. I have been playing this game for 8 years. As you can see from the title, there is a glitch where my game won’t launch. It just stays in the loading screen and at the same point. Every time i have to refresh when i see this, and i know it isn’t the wifi. I know you can play without wifi but i really want to play in a real i just purchased. At his brings up my next topic. When i do get to load in, i go straight to the realm, because like i said i had just purchased a realm and i really want to work in it. Each time i get in i get like 2 minutes to play, then it freezes. It just freezes. This is starting to get annoying, but for those reading this unsure of getting the game, this has never happened to me before and i’m sure the devs will fix the problem. I still love the game, but i wish they would simply fix this glitch",Bedrock unable to launch and realms not working.
5,2018-12-14 11:25:51,"A while back, I got ungrounded and tried to open up the game. When it opened, I decided I was bored with my old skin and tried to change it to a different custom skin I had on my phone. It wouldn’t work and Id be stuck with the original I had that I was bored of. After probably about 10 or so attempts, I gave up and I decided to look through the free skins. I found one I liked and I used that one. It actually showed up on my character, so I went to play on one of my creative worlds. When I tried to open it, it would load a tiny bit and then freeze and no matter how long I left the game open, it would not load. I tried it a few weeks later but it still didn’t work and I tried it a couple days ago, but still nothing. If it was fixed I would play the game more, especially because I can get my add-ons into the game unlike on my pc. I really wish this was fixed because I also got some ideas for one of my worlds that I can’t do until it’s fixed because it’s also broken on my laptop.  Edit  Since the new update a couple days ago, the game’s been running great! I guess the update fixed whatever bugs were there. Thanks!",Glitches but otherwise great

5,2022-08-29 01:18:07,"Minecraft is a fun and appropriate game for people of all ages. Aside from some scary details but I’ll get to that later. Anyways, I love how much you can do and in Minecraft, you can test how creative you are in a single player creative mode world, or give yourself a challenge in a multiplayer survival mode world. You can build, mine, craft, create red stone machines, farm, PVP, RP, what’s not to like about Minecraft? There is something for everyone in this mobile/PC game! Is that not enough for you? Never fear! Download a mod and to not risk getting a virus, the game has a safe and secure marketplace for mods, skins, and textures with some stuff is free. A fun, appropriate game with constant updates and so much to do, no wonder it’s the bestselling game! Remember when I said that I would get to other details later? Now’s the time. There is a bit of hidden lore that can be a little creepy, and cave sounds often scare people when mining. There is also 2 disks that sound very creepy that contains lore. Also there is a not true myths like hero brine, and giant Alex. But overall, it’s the best game for me and a lot of people. I’m happy with it and I can’t live without it personally.",The best game ever!
5,2022-07-05 23:52:10,"Minecraft is so fun! I have been playing this stuff since I was about 7!! It’s so adventurous and I love that you can build so much with your Imagination! I am currently working on a “Game” in Minecraft that’s about scientist working on sheep and you figure out they are killers and ima make it so my friends join em and play it! So far it’s going great! I love playing with my friend and trying to survive in the night! I play this game all the time and I LOVE building random stuff! But one downside, I have perfect full WiFi but yet sometime my avatars don’t work AT ALL and I can’t join any of my friends and I can’t load into my worlds! Also I have this app that give me free MODS and they work fine but something about Minecraft made it so all of the shaders I get don’t work, everyone on the app complained about this and we haven’t figured out why but I guess that’s fine tho!! I love this game so much and I have a recommended update that you can do (maybe) I get MANY MANY MANY MANYYY furniture packs and I hate doing it. I would like it if we could get  furniture in the future. But I love This game so much and that you so much for spending you time coding it!!!  -P.S: yall r cool",BEST GAME EVER
5,2021-02-04 01:25:21,"Well, I have to admit, it IS a good game, just with some mistakes. Some are too minor and unimportant to discuss, so I would not talk about those. Well, I love playing “cubecraft” server, especially the lucky blocks one. You can either get super lucky or super unlucky. Once I got sooooo lucky, I was packed with iron and diamond armor, with a diamond sword, a frost path wand, healing potions, and a bow. But, just when I was going to win, IT KICKED ME OUT OF THE SERVER!!! Another, rather minor though, is the loading. You load when you get in, you load when you get out. You load when getting into a world or server. I think loading into the world is more critical. YOU TAKE LIKE ABOUT A MINUTE OR SO!!! Yes, but I forgot one. This is bad for the gamers though, and good for the developers. Especially in the pandemic, people get stuck at home, so they would play Minecraft, a lot. Some of them are adults and teens, which controls themselves and don’t get addicted. Unlike kids, which I am, do. So, if a parent is reading this, I suggest you to not get your kid this game. Once he or she is older with more self control, sure. Just those mistakes. Overall, I do like it.",It has positives and negatives...
4,2017-09-29 01:27:03,"I’ve been playing Minecraft pe for over three years now and couldn’t wait for this update to come out. I’m glad we can finally play with Xbox and windows 10 players, but I do have some complaints though. Me personally I prefer the old con-trolls better, so when you get the update, you might have to pay around with the settings a little bit. The inventory in this game has no setting so you can switch to the old inventory, and gets a little getting used to. The only options there are, are classic and pocket. Another little issue, which is not a big deal is when you stop, it doesn’t have that slow animation like it did in the old version. When your flying around the world and you stop, it just stops completely. Again this is not a big issue, just pointing it out. One more thing I don’t like is I am always stuck in 4 or 6 chunks. To fix this I have put in to 4 chunks and then go in my world. After I have to exit the game and enter Minecraft every time I want to play. I hope Mojang fixes this bug. Overall this update is pretty good with new and exciting items and the ability to play with Xbox/window users. I highly recommend this to whoever is looking for a good game.",Great Game But Needs some fixes
1,2019-04-24 12:39:35,"All of my worlds have been corrupted since the latest update went live. My game crashes every few minutes, and upon loading the world again it deletes things. There was no need to change the villages' appearances, as they were what made Minecraft, well.. Minecraft. The game doesn't feel the same after the update, and to any new players, I would no longer recommend it. I've played this game for 7 years now, and I've never been this disappointed. A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for. I'm really upset with the direction the game's going and a lot of people are claiming to be having these problems. I don't want my world to be messed up forever. I don't want to lose this game, but I can not only bear to stand to play it, I literally can't keep it open with this update. Get it together. I miss Minecraft being Minecraft and this update's ruined everything. I don't want anyone else to be as disappointed as I am. With the amount of kids that play this game, they don't deserve it. Their parents don't need to be stressing over why everything's wrong with their kid's game. Nobody wants this.",Awful Update
5,2018-07-21 03:31:59,"So I’ve been playing Minecraft for about  2-3 years already and I absolutely adore it , I want to make a YT channel soon about Minecraft , etc . But the thing is , my button that makes the character move backwards and forwards is stuck? It’s like every time I press it , it will work slowly and that causes me to die a lot which I absolutely hate . But other then that , whoever is thinking of getting Minecraft you really should buy it. I promise you its worth the money and when you play with your friends it’s even more fun ! I have one last suggestion , I would really appreciate it if we had more animals ! I don’t want to sound greedy , the new update was amazing ! But I just need more animals and more things to do with them . Maybe add little things . like mice , bees , ants , and birds that just fly in the sky and only land on mountain hills . I know you can buy this somewhere but It would be appreciated if we could buy it for mobile devices as well . Anyway , continue on making this amazing game ! Please add more things we could do with the dogs and other animals . For example we can have the dog roll over or something sweet like that! ~~Dee",My opinion on Minecraft
3,2021-10-27 06:29:31,"I’ve been playing Minecraft since it first came out. Overall a fun game even though now I mostly play it just to build houses and whatnot.  My main issue with pocket is that there’s a bug with the latest update that causes any tamed animals (horses, wolves, and cats) along with farm animals to despawn when you start the game again. There was an ongoing bug where every now and then your horse would disappear when you got off of it, but now all animals are just disappearing from the game. And if you had any horses, they disappear with your saddles and armor if they’re wearing it. I also noticed that my armor stands along with any armor that’s placed on it will also disappear next time you load the game. There’s been a few times where villagers will disappear completely too but it’s less frequent. Reloading the game doesn’t help at all and it’s very frustrating. It’s making playing in survival almost not worth it for me considering I can’t farm and have to hope the animals spawn near me and that I have the resources to tame them again. I’ve gone on the mojang bug report page but it seems like other people have had this problem but it hasn’t been solved so I’m leaving this here hoping the lower rating gets their attention.",Annoying bugs
4,2019-04-06 20:06:39,"Minecraft is a great game! But all games have flaws. I have been thinking of a lot of improvements that this game could possibly use in order to become an even better game. Now I know no one will read this but I still want to share my opinions and thoughts of how this game can benefit by simply changing and possibly using my ideas. 1) Bookmarks, now this sounds very weird, but I promise it’s not what you think it means. For example, when i’m in the Nether and I find a fortress, i can’t save my place. And the only thing I can do is put /spawnpoint (which will let me lose my original spawnpoint). So maybe we can bookmark or just have multiple locations to teleport to. 2) Decocraft: Now i’m sure that a lot of people recommend this, but it will truly expand the creativity of the game. It will not only let us build our homes, but also it will express creativity through decorating. Which is the whole point of the game. Right?  Now thank you Mojang for truly inspiring me for the past 5-7 years. I love this game and its amazingly educational and creative. Sorry im just being rude and trying to correct everything😂. This game is awesome and thank you! (Please maybe possibly take my ideas into consideraton??)",Minecraft is Great...But...
5,2021-06-01 16:31:25,"I’m sure everyone has heard about Minecraft. Minecraft is an amazing game full of creativity and learning. As a Minecraft veteran I know many you tubers and streamers who have been playing this game for years and have made up my childhood. People like DanTDM and Pewdiepie played/play Minecraft and they were the reason I started. I have a world that I play every day and there is so much to do in Minecraft like building red stone contraptions, houses, buildings, cities, and much more. The animation and quality is amazing and is the perfect game to play with friends. Playing with my friends has made it a lot more fun. The music of Minecraft really spices the game up and everyone just fits perfectly to make Minecraft an awesome game.   I would personally like to thank Minecraft for all it has done for me, during times where I don’t feel good, or when I’m bored. It really keeps me happy and for all the years I have played it has always been excellent. If you have never tried Minecraft I definitely recommend, and if you tried it before and didn’t like it, I definitely think you should try again, especially with friends.",Minecraft
5,2020-08-05 02:56:44,The mob I was thinking about is a mob that is called the joker what it does it will occasionally come to the village that you live in and it will take a villager every time it comes the only way to keep it from taking a villager is ringing a bell so all the villagers stay inside the only way to know a joker is coming the next day is you will see a very tall cactus that is on a grass block and I know that’s not possible to have a cactus on grass but the thing is if you break the cactus you won’t get any of the cactus also iron golems can’t stop jokers only you can another way you can keep them from taking a villager is defeating but jokers have a lot of health and do a lot of damage (up to 6 full hearts of damage and are melee) also when  a villager is stolen you can get it back by find the joker with a black ender pearl (crafted with gunpowder black dye and a end pearl) how you use it though is you throw it like a ender eye and you follow it (the black end pearl can not burst like the ender eye) Also the drop is up to 1-2 enchanted golden apples or whatever you want it to be Minecraft also Minecraft plz read and I hope you make also keep up the good work and bye,This game needs a new mob.
4,2019-03-23 21:28:09,"So I joined a sever and it had this thing to accept to use a certain texture pack and I agreed. BUT when I join my worlds, well it still had the texture pack on and there is no possible way to put it back. I’m freaking out because I built a huge stable and if I make a new account that world would be deleted. The horses on this texture pack are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ugly and I just want them back to normal. There is no way to copy and paste a world onto another account so I’m stressed!! I’m an equestrian aka a horse rider that just wants her world back to normal so if you are reading this, and you’re Mojang please fix it. And since I am an equestrian, horse updates would be amazing. Maybe there could be saddle pads and horse boots like the base is Horse Armor. Horse treats and salt licks. Brushes to brush the horses down. As I said earlier I have a huge horse stables and that would be awesome. And maybe after a day they could be dirty or something. CROSS TIES, like if you tie a lead to a fence in a wash stall, you could add another lead to make a cross tie. Maybe also adding mane and tail styles. And fix the foals or baby horse bc they glitch through walls or blocks. Last but not least a better jump instead of them rearing over the jumps. My Xbox live thingy is: Jefferypony183",Loving it! But....
4,2018-11-23 03:00:17,"This game is great but there is no point in mining. I know if more ores were added that would mess with armor so that is why all the current ores,weapons,and armor should be completely revamped. That way more ores can be incorporated in to the system such as copper,titanium,ruby,topaz,nickel,peridot,and hundreds more. To encourage people to use different armor and weapons each ore could have its own unique weapon. The armor could maybe give a slight increase to the player in some way. Caves in general need changed. Each biome should have its own respective cave and in the caves different mobs might spawn. For example in a desert cave zombies won’t spawn instead husks will. Maybe mummies can spawn instead of skeletons. Each biome cave should also have different spawn rates for ores. For example gold might only spawn 100% in the Mesa biome in deserts it could be a 20% chance and in a jungle you won’t find any. Underground house ruins that have loot should be in caves. They could have there own unique set of items to make people go “yes thank you I finally found one”. Instead of “ oh another worthless structure with loot I have”. This review is getting long and my battery is about dead so lets hope some of the stuff I said is added.",We need a cave update!!!!!!!
5,2023-10-21 22:03:29,"I commend everyone who worked on this game, because it is just awesome to start off. We have creative mode where the player can do and create everything this allows for total creative freedom players can build anything and everything there is so many blocks in the game that it’s honestly insane how many choices there are and the new updates just keep getting better and better every update this game had better do it in one way it started off as as something that was really popular and ended as a cultural phenomenon that will forever be remembered in gaming till the end of time this game is amazing in survival mode. Oh boy survival mode personally, I am more of a creative player but I’ve tried survival mode and is fun as heck. I absolutely love exploring the infinite terrain that Minecraft just cooks up for you. It’s honestly insane how many biomes how many stuff you can see all the animals everything about it is just awesome.

3,2018-07-27 13:04:46,Minecraft is a very good game and it’s one of my favorite games ever but when you say you updated to fix the bugs your really making it worse it’s not fun to play when it’s glitchy and has lots of bugs. It’s a very good game I recommend getting it.  Also when I try to join my friends world it says connecting to multiplayer game then it turns brown and says unable to connect to world and then the only option is the button that says OK. It is not our phones we are both on good WiFi’s and it worried before and when I updated it that’s when it happened she already updated hers and we could play but once I updated mine it would not let us. She can join any of my worlds but I can’t join hers at all. I also have 12 worlds and when I play one of the survival worlds It’s nothing but glitch and it freezes you can press the forward button but it’s frozen and it’s very glitchy. Mobs don’t move and Minecraft kicks you out. Basically you click on the app it has a white screen and then it says MINECRAFT then it goes to my home screen please like this review if this is happening to you so mojang can know its happening to all of you too. Otherwise it is A very good game and if they fix it maybe I can actually have a good time playing :),Bugs glitches and much more
5,2022-02-20 15:28:44,"This game made my childhood. There are few problems with it. Although I have 251 minecraft worlds, which makes backups impossible. I stopped my phone from backing up minecraft because the amount of worlds I have is about 4 GB. It takes a while to delete just one world, just because you have to open the world’s settings, which takes about 3 seconds because of the loading, scroll to the bottom, which takes 1 second, then press delete and then confirm it which takes 2 seconds. Then, if you want to delete multiple worlds consecutively you need to go back to the worlds page, which means another 3 second loading screen. Overall, just one world takes 9 seconds, so I would have to be deleting worlds for almost 40 minutes, assuming I don’t stop to think about each world. I think minecraft should add a feature that allows you to select multiple worlds simultaneously and delete multiple at the same time. Or maybe a way to delete all of your worlds without deleting your achievements, Addons, everything you buy with minecoins, and all of your friends.",This game is great.
4,2020-01-01 22:21:14,Minecraft is amazing. Don’t get me wrong. It has tons of mobs and exploration! It is a way to get along and socialize! In some cases. Even educational! There’s at least a hundred biomes in this game! There can even be some unknown out there! And every single update is a big excitement and there is always more to discover! I love this game very much since I played ever since I was 5. It even helped me in school! But there is a few flaws. Let’s start with bosses. Ever since there has been only 2 bosses. And I must admit. It’s getting more and more boring day by day. I always wish there was at least Mini bosses. Like a queen bee. Or a Illager King. Those would be amazing. It adds more of a vibe to the game. And what about the Structures! There are more of those everyday but it gets boring every now and then. I was thinking some Sky Islands to make better use of Elytra. Or a Volcano! Those would be amazing. And that is not all the flaws. You came a long way Minecraft. I’m not letting you loose your charm. A decade is a lot to take on. But you made it. Still the Prince Charming. And I’m thankful. But every now and then. I gotta admit that it gets boring. But don’t give up just yet! Continue and don’t ever stop! Congratulations for making it to 2020. Alive.,Awesome O’ Awsome
5,2020-10-03 03:03:08,"I have been playing this game since pretty much right as it came out. It’s one of the most iconic games of all time and it definitely deserves it! I have zero complaints. I love how the developers still update super often even though Minecraft is fairly old. (Not as old a Roblox hehe) It would be cool if you could give a Totem if Undying to a tamed animal so they could be resurrected and maybe they could respawn at your house somehow..? Maybe the last place they slept, or something like bees with their hives. I’ve accidentally killed things so many times and I was so sad. This one time when I was fairly young I thought it was a good idea to drag a horse and a dog around in the air by a lead and then missed the water I meant to land in and they both died. I remember being so sad and making graves for them and then explaining their deaths on their tombstones. I still make tombstones with names for iron golems, villagers, etc. I’m more careful with pets now... sorry I’m rambling. The point is, this game might cost money, but it’s amazing and the developers deserve the support. Please take my idea into consideration. Thank you for your time!",Huge part of my life

This is the only “video game” I’ll play nowadays. There is so much creativity to use and adventure to play in this game. But as a big fan I would like to recommend some cool update ideas, just because input can help add more flavor to the game and draw more new players in. I wanna start out with the seeds, I think it would be so cool to have more crazy maps than just the “spooky mansion” and villages. For example a basic town, upgraded villages, etc. I know there are temples that you can buy with coins (by spending real money). But not everyone can afford to pay for every map they want to play. You guys used to offer the feared where you could download some maps and play individually on your own. Which was awesome for people like me who want to see what the maps are all about before paying to play with others. I think that was coolest feature you guys had, but for some reason you don’t have it anymore and it’s a bummer. Hopefully you’ll bring it back though! While adding even more exciting things to the game!",TOTALLY LOVE
5,2019-01-21 01:39:27,"Ok, just to start, who could hate this game? It is the best survival adventure game out there, it allows those with a large imagination to let it out and create their mind, but also, helps make your brain start working on how to survive in harsh conditions and environments... But if there was one thing I could ask to be added/changed, it would be the superflats... unlike all of the other Minecraft editions out there, (idk about switch and Wii U, I don’t have any of those) there really is no way to get your brains really working in extreme environments..., like being able to make a super flat world but having the ability to customize it, and I don’t mean like, a limited amount of blocks, I mean all kinds of peaceable blocks, without anything that will make it to where you can’t do the world creation, cuz I LOVE to make worlds that have the void then a block that is affected by gravity, those worlds are the BEST, but there are now regulations on that in all console editions, which makes it a bit less fun...

Hopefully you read this, still 5 stars because it’s super fun but it’s better with friends.",Signing in is Hard
5,2021-12-02 21:38:39,"So I am addicted to it because u can build anything u want and play on public servers too! But the one thing I wish would happen is that the Java Minecraft would already be in the bedrock addition so that you don’t have to get Java. This is because I saw a video where u can make a door that opens and closes when u turn a page on a lectern but it wouldn’t work on bedrock u had to put the book on and off the lectern to do it. Other than that I LOVE IT .. BEST GAME EVER!! So exited for the new update with a new mob that’s called a sculk I think? So fun I am addicted to it!! Addition to my review..... My and my friend were trying to get into the same game, we already friended each other and updated to the latest update but it still wouldn't work.. It said that she was an outdated client.. So I knew it wasn't my iPad it was hers bc I play with other people all the time. Developers pls look at this and tell me how to fix this. Thank you! P. S... The game is amazing and no lag at all. The servers are rlly fun too. I just wish cubecraft would bring back it's old hub where there was. Parkour under it I loved trying to beat it.",The best game I have ever played
3,2020-01-18 19:48:25,"I have an iPhone 7 so I assume I should be able to play this on my phone. But every time I try to open the app it loads most of the way to the main menu but then just stops. It freezes and never finishes loading. Closing the app completely and reopening it only has it starting over loading only to freeze somewhere near the same spot again and again and again. Somehow I played a little when I first downloaded the game but ever since I can’t even get to the main menu... Ive deleted the app and redownloaded it from the store and that doesn’t solve the problem either. I am seriously disappointed in this app because this is actually my SECOND time giving it a try. A couple years ago I tried downloading this app on a different phone and had the exact same problem and I ended up deleting it and forgetting about it for years. Just recently tried getting back into Minecraft again only to see that Mojang has STILL not bothered to fix a game ruining bug that has persisted for years. Very disappointed in this product, it could have been a decent way to play while away from my computer but so far it’s been literally nothing but wasted phone memory. Fix your app Mojang. This is absurd...",I bet this game sure would be fun if I could play it...
4,2022-07-15 16:20:22,Are used to love playing this game 24 seven when I was younger but when I was 13 I said we went blind I really need you guys to step up on the accessibility feature it is pretty good for a starting for starting but you guys really do need to step out on it I love this game and it’s really sad that when I try to play it it’s really difficult for me and other blind people in my community I hope you get to read this and I really enjoy this game just please make it more accessible like make it easier for us to be able to read what we need to do to move around and what we need to do to fly in creative and all that I also really you guys really need to make it more easier to find stuff in the inventory and crafting it is a little hard for us because it’s just saying wooden fence 18 of 97 and it’s not really telling us if we’re getting it or not and it’s really hard to figure out where somethings are like the animals and all that it’s really hard to scroll and it’s really hard to move around I really hope you guys could help fix this and if you could thank you so much it would make me and the other people in the black community so happy,Accessibility
5,2019-06-13 01:39:50,"Disclaimer: This isn't really a review but rather my own thoughts on MCPE in its entirety. -- I've been playing this game since the demo (version 0.4.0 at least), I have to say; every stage and update to this game has been great to witness and be a part of. The mechanics of the game kept getting smoother and being able to connect without being on the same WiFi network is GREAT compared to earlier versions of PE. I can't wait for the 1.12 update and further BUT 1.11 is fun and I still have a lot to do before I'm even ready for another big update. Community created content like shaders, mods, texture packs, maps, skin packs, etc are always getting better and better. It's great to see this game is thriving again after beginning it's slow descent. I play this game on each platform and each version has its own pros and cons. There's minimal glitches within this game, there always will be, that's how open-world games are. Playing this game casually, competitively, solo, or multiplayer, and on any platform, is a great place to put your creativity to the test or push your knowledge and skills of survival to the breaking point via your own mentally set challenges.",Splendid
5,2020-11-20 23:37:12,"Ok I LOVE the game but you should add modern furniture like not a mod but a update like you can craft the furniture add chairs we can sit in and couches we can sit in maybe add plushies,Corgies,Huskies,and every single dog breed you can think of please I’m sorry if this is to much to ask for but can you also add a few new blocks please? Maybe add corn or turkeys or or or plates! What about..oh right I almost forgot please add real working cars! Here’s a good one every one will LOVE ok so if it’s Christmas or thanksgiving or you know Halloween maybe you can add stuff like updates depending on the hollow day like for Christmas maybe add a update that a Christmas tree appears somewhere maybe in your house or somewhere you spawn and then on Christmas Day presents will spawn next to the tree and when you tap the presents they open and something will appear in your inventory! So there’s a slight problem when ever I build a house my arms get tired and my fingers also get tired so maybe you can make a block and when ever you place it down it makes you a house! Also one more thing can you make a working a computer? Ok that’s all!",Good but needs a few up dates
5,2020-10-22 21:46:36,"So I was in the menu of Minecraft ready to load up my world and find some diamonds, when all of a sudden the menu went white! So I wanted and it fixed itself, but not really. When it fixed itself, it was in the first version of Minecraft pocket edition and new combined!!! The hi was messed up, buttons wouldn’t work, and everything was broken! It turns out it reverted to the demo version, meaning it Has to be in the game files somewhere. It says unlock full version, but I already own it! I’m deleting and reinstalling with high hopes. The game however, is great. Can’t wait for caves and cliffs! Keep up the good work Mojang! (Also please fix this glitch)   EDIT:  So it fixed when I reinstalled it, but bad news bear I’m signed out of Microsoft, lost my skin, and all my worlds are deleted. I had so much, I hope when I get back signed in to the Microsoft account it will restore my worlds. I’m devastated by this though, I was this close 👌to beating the game, I literally found the enderportal, not more than 30 blocks away from my base! I only needed blaze rods to beat the game. AND ITS ALL GONE. I really hope I can get my worlds back.",My game broke😰😰😰but still a good game
5,2019-11-03 16:34:46,"Don’t get me wrong, this is a great game but I got 2 glitches.  First glitch, it won’t let me choose a new custom skin, it lets me choose two skins that I had before, slim and normal.  It’s hard to explain but I chosen a skin then I wanted to change it, I got to change it once on the slim character, and once on the normal character. Then I tried to get a different slim skin, it did not let me.  It was just my old slim skin. Second glitch, it keeps taking me out of mineplex mini-games.  I usually play on the servers, and my fav server is mineplex, so I joined the server and went to speed builders, but when ever I got into speed builders or any other game in mineplex it takes me out of the app.  (Btw I’m on a   iPad mini) I went on a different iPad and it worked perfectly fine.  I had the same WiFi and everything but the other iPad was a bigger iPad.  Whenever I play mineplex on my iPad mini this problem never happens.  I tried deleting it and reinstalling it but it still did not work.  I deleted several other apps but it still did not work.  Please try to fix these glitches I know that I’m not the only one with this problem.",Amazing game! but few glitches. (Please Read)
5,2019-09-01 02:13:41,"I love Minecraft and have been playing it for years. However, I stopped using the app for a while, due to a glitch that occurs while playing on WiFi. I know that this glitch has probably been reported before, and that there may be fixes to this, but as of right now I am unsure of how to fix this issue. Basically, the issue is that, whenever I have WiFi enabled I am unable to do anything in the game, as the app becomes unresponsive. But, as soon as I disable WiFi I can begin to use the app again. I have tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, as well as reconfiguring my WiFi settings, but have had no luck. Recently, I have begun using the app again, and as much as I love single player mode, I would love to play in multiplayer with my family. I have pretty much run out of ideas of how to fix this, and would appreciate seeing this issue resolved. I have already reported this bug to Mojang’s bug tracker, but I thought that leaving a review might help too. Aside from this issue, the game is AMAZING! I enjoy all the new features that the devs have added over the years, and can’t wait to see what they add in the future! 😊",Glitch?
5,2018-11-12 21:27:55,"I love Minecraft through and through. I have been playing it for over 10 years and I am still obsessed. Minecraft is for anyone. If you are angry you can blow off steam by killing mobs. If you are feeling creative you can build stuff. If you dream of becoming an electrician than you can build contraptions until you run out of ideas. I have met people of many types through it. The only limit is literally your imagination. There are many terrains to choose from and unique baddies to fight. For parents, the only way to play with people is if those two people are on the same Wifi. Even with all the amazing stuff you can do, I wish there was world edit. It is on PC and Mac but not Pocket Edition. You can build huge walls by a couple clicks of a button. Everything else is great though. There are zombies, skeletons, giant spiders, and a massive dragon. There are also sheep, cows, pigs, chickens, dolphins, fish, and a bunch more. You can make it even more awesome by adding mods and texture packs. Texture packs change how stuff looks, and mods (short for modifications) make more recourses and animals. I thank you for reading my post and hope you get Minecraft too. 😁",The Dragon
3,2019-07-06 03:48:37,"Idk if it’s my phone or this app but when I was signed in it was fine for the first few weeks. Then just now I tried to go on it, and it said I was logged out. Then after it said my pw was wrong I changed it 2 times and it still said my pw is wrong, and at this point I give up, I’m really mad, and I wasted money on this game despite that you still keep your skins, I had downloaded two other skins that had worked when I was logged in. Then now that I’m not logged in it’s saying it’s not a mc skin, and honestly it’s acting really stupid😤. But tbh this was a better game when you didn’t have to sign in, like I played this game, and known about this game since I was 5 and I’m almost 15 now. I thought things would be better, and this logging into stuff is complicated and hard for some people, so if this doesn’t get anyone’s attention then wow😐. It’s okay I’ll just play Minecraft on ps4 from now on when I get one for my birthday. Don’t get me wrong I obviously love this game, but the fact that the profiles aren’t simple and easy to have mobile wise, are harder to have plus playing on mobile can cause arthritis in your thumbs anyway. But yea you need to fix this ASAP, and I could probably buy a controller or something to fix not getting arthritis.",What is going on???
5,2018-11-04 01:08:43,"I love the game, but I think we need more mobs and more tamable ones. You should also add more structures in the nether. I’m lovin’ the aquatic update! I had been waiting for it for so long. I also think there should be more dimensions. An idea would be Dreamland. When u go to sleep, there could be a 2/4 chance to go to dreamland, a place where you have to survive the nightmares and fight off mobs that could be called the “Night Terrors”. You could add a rare weapon called the Dream Catcher. If you collect it then the next time you go to dreamland you use it to fight the boss that could be called the “Night Crawler”. If you defeat the Night Crawler then Dreamland will be deleted from your server and you can’t go back to it. Also, the Nether is kind of boring. Adding more structures would make it fun. I basically never go to the nether just because of the fact that there is basically nothing to gain from going there. Sure, you could collect some glowstone, or get some wither heads, but there isn’t any point to spawning the wither. I mean, why go through all of the work to get a boring star? All it does is make a beacun. I feel like the beacun should have a better purpose.",Super fun
5,2020-12-02 22:45:44,"This game is amazing. The creative mode lets you build almost anything you can think of and the survival mode has multiple difficulty levels you can challenge yourself with. I didn’t think the mobile version of this game would be as good as the console version but I was wrong. Mojang literally set a new standard for the quality of games after they released Minecraft. You can’t run out of things to do on it. I am currently playing on survival mode hoping to beat the ended dragon for the first time. There is only one problem with the mobile version. I haven’t seen this on console but in certain areas of caves you will take damage that eventually kills you, even if nothing is hitting you. I have seen some other reviews about this too. Mojang makes games with very good quality so I’m sure it will be fixed quickly. Overall, I recommend playing this game. It can be very fun and challenging. My rating of this game is 4.5 stars because of the occasional bugs but I can’t do that so I made it five stars. The console version is perfect. Five stars.",Minecraft Review. 4.5 stars.

5,2020-01-18 12:44:09,"I play Minecraft on my iPad, and it’s amazing. Everything is fine about my gameplay, apart from one problem I had just recently had. When I play Minecraft, there are something’s that I want to improve, so I seek Resource And texture packs. I already knew how to install them. Just Find the media link, Download it, copy the download to another app, and then share it with Minecraft. I could do this anytime, but until recently I couldn’t do it anymore. When you click the share button, you see a list of apps that it could be shared to. My problem is that once I updated Minecraft to 13.1 (I believe) Minecraft wasn’t listed as a app I could share with. I tried anything to fix it but nothing has worked. I was really bummed out because I found this nice shaders I wanted to test out. If I find any solution, I will definitely share it. That’s my only problem, everything else is fine. Just fix this one problem and I’ll be super grateful!  Update: I found a new way to do it, and even though it works I liked the old version where it would instantly download. But I’m now fine with everything!",Can’t Upload Packs or add-ons to my Minecraft App

On my other iPad, whenever I close it and I didn’t leave the app, I use my iPad again and then it just stops that I have to reset it. 2. It’s starting to get boring.. ( I still love it! I’m not trying to be rude rn ) I would like a few more updates.. tho if you can’t make it rn or maybe never? It’s alright! 3. It’s kinda hard on PlayStation but I got the hang of it! ( maybe ._. ) 4. It’s great but.. I don’t know what to do.. I love building houses.. I love.. it’s just.. idk tbh. Tho I would love if you would fix these bugs / add these things ( 1. And 2.
