CAN YOU PLEASE ADD A TEEN SECTION, its so hard to find anything good that isn‚Äôt rated TV-MA because my parents wont let me watch anything thats TV-MA. Second, CAN YOU PLEASE STOP CANCELING SHOWS. Like most of the good shows that me and a lot of other people like got canceled, whereas these completely dumb shows got like 12 seasons or a sequel. Which brings me to my next request, can you please take away all the bad elementary school shows that make me want to pull my hair out (my sister and my mom make me watch them i would never watch willingly) like kid danger, and teen love story's that basically all go the same way like the kissing booth or tall girl. Also kinda an add-on to my first request but can you make a teen profile. Like how the kid profiles are but for teens. Like there would be no nudity or extreme violence, or kids stuff like cocomelon or stuff like  what I said in request 3. but there can be like swearing and limited gore. Lastly, can you please review your ratings more because its really annoying when there‚Äôs nothing that bad about the show but its still TV-MA because theres somebody cutting their hand to get an infection out that somehow qualifies as self harm. Thats it hopefully you act on some of these I know its kinda long sorry about that but overall good app.",PLEASE READ NETFLIX
4,2021-12-30 14:48:36,1. There should be a feature where you have to enter your account with a password so many people are entering my account and deleting my favorite shows and watching other shows I do not like. 2. There shouldn‚Äôt be max accounts I hate sharing a Netflix account with my brother everyone should have a Netflix account on there own. 3. (I do not know if this feature is added) You should also add a feature that locks episodes or movies so your kids cannot watch them. 4. You should sort movies and shows by ratings like PG 13 will go in a row and TV MA there. 5. You should finish some shows. In Netflix most shows are left behind with like 3 seasons but the real show has 8. 6. You should be able to delete movies and shows from the continue list. It is so annoying. 7. Also you may wanna put a lock on PG 13 and TV 14 and TV MA  and rated R and you have to enter a pin and your face so they will know you are not young. 8. You should put a list of shows and movies that you do not like and they won‚Äôt be visible to you anymore. 9. You should put a swear word censor on the kids account or Adult account it will be in audio and subtitles. 10. No kids should watch inappropriate stuff and I been seeing on the kids profiles. I hope you can fix all this. Bye,Could be better
5,2022-10-25 17:26:12,"I have been using Netflix for years now. It is so amazing! There are unlimited shows for all ages and show types‚Ä¶what i mean is different types of shows for different people. Action, comedy, horror, romance, family‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all there. Personally, my favorite show is Bunk‚Äôd, which would be considered comedy. I highly recommend it!!! So amazing. There are so many options. One thing, though. There are some inappropriate shows that show up on even a kids profile. My mom still makes me use a kids profile because of all the inappropriate shows about nudity, drugs, etc and shows with swearing and stuff. It still shows up even on that profile. Just not as much. But could you please have that stuff ONLY on adult profiles? I don‚Äôt like seeing it, and I‚Äôd rather have a Watch Together profile, and still not see it much. My little siblings‚Äîwe‚Äôre talking toddlers here‚Äîsee that stuff on their profiles too. I really would like it if you didn‚Äôt have all of that. But Netflix is mostly amazing, which is why I gave it five stars, though it was close to four stars because of the inappropriate show stuff.

4,2022-03-13 15:55:06,"I was scrolling through Netflix and I had a wonderful thought so I decided to act on it and write to Netflix through this review. There are plenty of times when I‚Äôm scrolling through Netflix and I am trying to avoid nudity in shows and movies. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if there were a way to toggle on and off all shows that have a specific tag instead of just the rating? For example, there are plenty of shows that are rated TV-MA and don‚Äôt have nudity that are great to watch. However, you have to filter them all yourself and check the rating before hand and it takes up a lot of time when looking for something new to view. Now, imagine if I can just go to me settings page and toggle on and off certain tags to make my browsing easier by removing shows/movies with the tag from appearing during your browsing. Now I know that doing it with every single tag would be a pain in the behind but just doing the major tags would help out a lot of people I think.  I also, want to explain what I mean by tag in the case it isn‚Äôt clear. I‚Äôm not talking about genre such as thriller, action. Etc. I‚Äôm talking about the tags associated with the rating system like nudity, extreme violence, adult content, adult language, etc.",IDEA FROM A CONSUMER/VIEWER.
3,2023-04-12 01:52:51,"Oh Netflix. I will say navigation is better on mobile than a computer - on computers when you get suggested titles there‚Äôs no easy way to rate what you‚Äôve already watched and yet in both places that presents a problem within itself - if I‚Äôve already watched something I wish you would remove it from the rows of shows and movies and the better way to do this would be to have a previously rated section where all these already rated shows can live. With all the content Netflix has the cluster of what you call organization is a huge turn off and I find myself using the platform less because of it.   Also, Netflix basically birthed the term binging so I also hate when you try to be like traditional cable and release shows by date - whoever decided this was a good idea - you don‚Äôt understand a competitive advantage when you have one as no one really likes having to tune in weekly if they also had the option of just watching all the way thru (time permitting of course). Again you‚Äôve managed to take a competitive advantage and found a way to regress to be like everyone else. Sometimes people try too hard and overlook the easy reasons why they are losing subscribers and a lot of it has to do with when you lose those core things that made you great.",Doubt anyone reads these but

This man‚Äôs response to me was ‚Äúuse the mobile app‚Äù and when I said I can‚Äôt watch on my tv he said ‚Äúno you have to pay 7.99 for another screen‚Äù  So I have to pay extra for a service because I travel for work and want my child to be able to watch at home still? This is how you treat customers that have been with you for years? I hear you loud and clear Netflix. Paying for 2 screens is not enough for you, you need more from me. I think you will find this move, and the way you are having your representatives address this with customers (rude and dismissive quite frankly) will be the end of your company.  No amount of original content games or reruns will entice people to pay for your app, when there are much better services out there for a lot less money.

Sure there are tons (and I mean TONS) of articles all over the web giving instructions on how to remove shows from the currently watching section that you no longer want to view, but Netflix it‚Äôs your job to provide an easier method for doing this. It‚Äôs unrealistic to expect people to go into their history and delete a millions episodes of a show just to get to the movies and whatever other shows they need to remove from that section. Just allow a space on the titles to remove them from that area. Especially for shows or movies that you try out and end up not liking. They stay there for months! Also, the app on tv plays the show or movie just when you‚Äôre trying to read the info about it and guess what?? That also adds that title to currently watching! Fix this issue please! It‚Äôs 2020!

1,2019-11-13 16:13:38,"I noticed over the past year that I have been using Netflix less and have been really disappointed with their selection and layout. So I downgraded to the lowest possible billing option and have been great with it for months now. Layout: I wish that when I selected which genre I want to watch that it showed a years list. I like 90's suspense thrillers and kids holiday movies, 50's creature feature horror movies, and 80's action and comedy movies. But it's a bit hard to find with their made up titled sections and makes me waste more time searching than watching. And the search feature doesn't not show me all the movies in these keywords as only a few can fit on the search screen. Also, there movie selection in these categories aren't that much and I end up watching Crackle a lot more. Ended up watching Crackle and Freeform Channel for Halloween instead! I feel Netflix has too much Drama and Gore movies-not my cup of tea. I expected new seasons of ""Sabrina the teenage witch,"" ""Mystery Science Theater,"" and other such shows to be new and available for October but they were not. So knowing when to show new show seasons for holidays is lacking. Who needs the new ""Nutcracker"" movie in July!? Also, when am I going to see new ""Mystery Science Theater"" episodes? Love the new show!! Creature feature movies are really lacking on Netflix!! And when is the new ""Bright"" movie coming out!? This is why I downgraded.","Downgraded instead, Not watching as much"

The app is significantly easy to use, and my favorite part is their always adding more!! It‚Äôs really easy to find things that your interested in because the app takes what you have watched, and recommends similar options. Most Netflix originals are also genuinely very good!  I do have two suggestions for somethings that could be implemented in the future. My  first idea is that you could be able to follow other people. This way you could find out what your friends, family, or anyone else you know, is watching/interested in. You could find lots of great shows that you didn‚Äôt know about or watch before. My second thing is something that has been mentioned in other reviews, and that is an actual, legitimate teen section. And i‚Äôm not talking tv-7. I‚Äôm  talking quality shows, PG13/TV14, stuff like that. I think both of these ideas could help improve Netflix in the future.  That‚Äôs all I have!

4,2022-05-05 00:44:22,"Hi Netflix and anyone reading this! I think Netflix should have a teens account. For me personally I‚Äôm only allowed to have a kids account and I‚Äôm sure many people can relate. To be honest some things on the kids account are good movies. But for people 10 and older that need to have a kids account need a higher selection‚Ä¶sometimes I can watch the grown up account with parent supervision but I would rather just have a my own account. Right now I barley use my kids account and watch the grown up account but some parents don‚Äôt feel comfortable. Their kid can hide their phone and could be watching  weird inappropriate things. On the grownups account most things are rated R but some things don‚Äôt need to be on there like Stranger Things  and other shows etc. But on a kids account there are things for babies or little kids like Cocomelon. There is a grown up and a kid but their needs to be an in between. I don‚Äôt understand why Tall Girl is on the kids account. If someone who watches coco melon watches Tall  Girl  they will see boyfriends and girlfriends that 2 year olds shouldn‚Äôt see. Anyway, I think their should be a teens account.

3,2021-06-25 07:40:09,"Henlo, I just wanted to write a little review because I love Netflix and have been on it since I was very little. One thing I would like to be added is a teen section. I‚Äôm almost a teenager and I love watching anime but all the good anime are in the adult section. The only anime that fits my expectations in the kids section is yu-gi-oh, card captor Sakura, and and K-ON. My parents are kinda strict with gore and nudity but all the anime‚Äôs that fit their standards are in the adults section üò≠. I think a teen section would be great for everyone because the kids section is wayyyy to kiddish and the adults section has wayyy to much inappropriate content. At least keep the teen section at PG-13 to TV-14 ( depending on the TV-14 content.) Also, I think the rating system for Netflix is kinda broken. Like Naruto and demon slayer are the same rating when demon slayer is LITERALLY ABOUT DEMONS WHO EAT INNOCENT PEOPLE AND THE ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT THEM IS TO DECAPITATE THEM!!!! At least finish the show or skim it good enough to rate it with a rating that fits the show and isn‚Äôt off so that innocent people (like me) who want to watch anime with strict parents and won‚Äôt either be traumatized from a sexual anime being rated too low and a age appropriate awesome anime being rated too high and not being able to watch it.

3,2021-02-18 16:06:43,"Dear Netflix,  I love Netflix SO much but, I do think it needs some work. First, I think there should be a teen section. The kid section is too immature for teens while some of the things in the adult section are too mature. The PG-13 and PG-14 content should be in its own section. There are also some titles that are rated TV-MA that also don‚Äôt feature much inappropriate content that could be in the teens section. I think the teen section can feature cursing, kissing, and violence but no nudity. Second, I think you should be able to lock your profile because kids can enter the adults section very easily and watch something inappropriate. Also if you share your Netflix account with other people they can enter your account and watch shows which will then give you show recommendations that you aren‚Äôt interested in or mess up the shows your watching. Third, I think you should be able to delete shows you watched but didn‚Äôt like from your Continue Watching because then a long list of TV shows and movies will line up and I think you should be able to do it from ALL devices. Fourth, I think shows shouldn‚Äôt be removed as often as they are and more shows should be added to the kids section since, its not updated as frequently as the adults section.",PLEASE READ!!!!

I was watching Haikyuu one time and I noticed that my phone was getting really hot, so I decided to unplug it and close out of the only app that was open, Netflix. About 7 minutes after I closed the app, my phone had cooled off significantly. I noticed that it was also draining my battery a lot faster than usual.

Half of the shows it has for pictures on there I‚Äôve never even heard of, don‚Äôt like, or not even remotely related to my interests. I think that based on what that person watches. For example I love how to train your dragon I watch it all the time but there‚Äôs no icon pictures for that. I think based on that I watch that all the time it should automatically put a section for those icon pictures on mine that would be much better. There‚Äôs something else I don‚Äôt get. How to train your dragon for another example you only have the second movie and two shows on there. What about the first and third movie and the other shows how to train your dragon is a whole connected thing why not have a he whole thing on there.

In the last year, I have called multiple times with the same issues, but they rarely are able to fix it properly for longer than a few weeks before it stops working again. 10 dollars USD a month, but if their service is unusable and you ask to be compensated for the lost time, they say ‚ÄúWe will not give you free time to replace what you couldn‚Äôt use.‚Äù That is a direct quote from a ‚ÄúCustomer Service‚Äù representative.

They sort of(elaborate later) keep up to date with shows that recently add new episodes or new movies that come out, though I have some concerns. First off, I think they try too hard to push their ‚ÄúNetflix original series‚Äù stuff to viewers to the point where they remove shows and movies that people like to force them into shows like paradise PD. Believe me, it was one of my favorite shows ever, but still, they take off way too many movies that people like to rewatch often like Shrek for example. As I was saying earlier about keeping up to date with new episodes and new movie releases, they tend to be very late with the additions. Even though they do still add them when the show is relevant, it‚Äôs usually not for weeks sometimes months before they come to Netflix. Overall great app interface, wide selection to choose from, but I think their only major flaw is pushing their own stuff too far down our throats and blocking our view from other amazing shows.",Awesome app but some problems

1,2023-07-20 12:31:04,"Netflix over the past many years has been constantly increasing the price for their services. Everytime it felt like I just wanted to enjoy a tv show or a movie I was always getting messages about how Netflix is yet again increasing the price‚Ä¶and now Netflix has done it again with removing free use of family sharing in different locations under the same account. They have also changed their plans yet AGAIN to make the consumer buy a service that genuinely only benefits them. They had a basic plan that most consumers bought because it was the best quality for the price and now they are completely removing that plan to make us seriously pay 20$ a month but they think it‚Äôs justified because you get your family sharing back with 4 lines! When we used to be able to do it for FREE! And the only other option is the 7$ plan with ads. Now I‚Äôm going to give my opinion on this, I would rather pay more money and not have ads but the fact that Netflix is taking their basic plan with no ads away and leaving a huge affordability and quality gap between the 2 plans is undesirable. I will be most likely canceling Netflix in the future because of the cost, greediness, and the lack of quality in good entertainment and removing the actually good entertainment.",Most Greedy Company

DI4RIES and Dead End: Phenomenal Park‚Ä¶ DI4RIES: Contains a bad word and gay, not that it is bad, but in a kids profile?? I‚Äôm Really sorry, but it doesn‚Äôt sound right. Dead End: Phenomenal Park: Just started and right on the second episode it shows gay yet again. I mean- Again it‚Äôs not bad to be gay or anything, but it seems like it should be in some teen or adult profile, not the kids- and it‚Äôs in the kids setting, so everything there was for kids. And I don‚Äôt at all watch those shows. So I have no idea how it was there, maybe some glitch?? My Total Review: I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars, because I don‚Äôt want to shame Netflix for adding gay or LGBTQ things. Netflix is good and all, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend adding those things to the kids, as they may start asking questions that they shouldn‚Äôt at their age. Also, please don‚Äôt remove Naruto or the good/old shows on the kids and adults. I badly love the shows that are being removed, I see bad complaints shaming Netflix for what they are doing, Netflix is amazing. Continue being you Netflix, Inc.!",Good But..

Anyways if anyone didn‚Äôt like Netflix then you should get it together. Because Netflix is amazing üòâ üòâI have one suggestion for you guys maybe you could put all the shows on Netflix and make something called Netflix world kind of like Disney world. Also you could make an app called Netflix games for an example a Good Burger make a game were you are Ed and you get to choose your own silly thing to do. And  then in the app you create your own Good burger. You choose all the characters. Then you can send them to Netflix and you can watch them. And you do that for all the things on Netflix! I know I‚Äôm being annoying but please please answer one of those suggestions.

If there was any place where I should be able to manage my passwords and activity it should be on my device. My info (card, address, etc) is associated to my account. One can argue logging in via laptop/computer could be less secure. Especially if the web browser saves passwords and I am a user who never logs out on a computer that never locks. I at least have Two factor authentication on my phone. If I am already logged in, ask for my password or send an email to my account with a verification number. Just don‚Äôt completely strip away my ability to manage my account promptly. At the very least, I should be able to opt out/in on account management on my device via email, if necessary. This needs to be fixed. I receive phishing emails asking me to reset my password regularly. I would like to change it via app immediately, if I feel my password had been compromised.  Rating may seem too low when everything else works well. However, security should be paramount to protect your users.

OUTRAGEOUS. it should be 10 dollars or less. i love netflix but it needs more movies and shows. i would love to recommend some to netflix, but usually i dont write reviews on stuff so netflix is lucky im doing this. im 15 years old and i love to watch childhood movies but my mother shouldnt have to put up with having to pay $17 for 2 screens. that should be the amount for 3. its dumb how 1 household, only 1 person can watch it per movie. you really have to pay to watch netflix when someone else is? thats dumb and definitely needs to be looked by this company, but the good side is the movies are thriller and much more entertaining and good quality. but netflix needs to overlook at the prices on the limited screens. but yes. netflix is really good and you need to try it if you already didnt. but i hope you write a review on the screen prices. because thats DUMB.","AMAZING APP, but needs some more movies/shows!"

There might be some new karate lovers that love each other. Let‚Äôs go to season 3, Tori and Robbie had a little bit of time spent together. They started getting a little buddy-buddy if you know what I mean;). So in season 4, they might hit it off a bit.

First of all, Netflix price started getting really expensive and I think it‚Äôs kind of outrageous. Second of all, I feel like there should be teen section where it is not like for kids to watch and nothing too much going on like way too much gore, blood, yet no nudity and sexual content but kissing is fine and not way too much strong language and stuff like that. Because I‚Äôm not into kids stuff nor nothing way too adult going on (I can handle gore btw), I think it would be better because some teens don‚Äôt like watching stuff for kids nor nothing way too inappropriate for teens to watch. Another reason why is that the movies and shows is being cancelled and now you can‚Äôt complete like the whole series or episodes or whatever. I don‚Äôt know why Netflix have to be expensive it could be better at the lowest $5 and the premium where you watch bonus content, uncut version of movies or more exclusive features like no advertisements at $12.

Now sometimes we get kicked out of our Netflix account when it‚Äôs from our own Tv or laptop.   Another huge issue, Netflix has officially now started playing ads. This was a big shock to my family. When one day we where watching a movie and a literal ad started playing in the middle of it. This bumped us out very much. There are already so many platforms that play ads and the main reason we stayed with Netflix for so long is the uninterrupted screen time. I know there is a higher subscription with no ads but I appreciated the affordability.   I am sad to say but Netflix is not how it used to be and I feel this platform is going downhill from here.

However, I recently found myself without a reliable wi-fi connection, which obliged me to stream over my LTE data connection. Much to my exasperation, I discovered that Netflix has taken the patronizing approach of disabling autoplay when streaming via cellular data. I thought at first that this irritation might be remedied by a quick trip to my account page, where the playback settings are found. However, there is just one autoplay-related checkbox, which was checked. A call to customer service confirmed that autoplay is unavailable over cellular. I feel that this policy is frankly ridiculous. With the profusion of unlimited data plans on the market, one should at least be given the option of whether to disable autoplay over data rather than have Netflix unilaterally decide the matter. I am perfectly capable of monitoring my own cellular data use; I do not need Netflix or any other company to hold my hand and choose whether I get to use cellular data.

I do not find most of the shows entertaining, though there are a select few, Netflix lacks the ability to create entertaining shows and should build ideations of a well constructed plot that grasps the attention of the audience, but like I said there are some that are interesting shows. If Netflix would be more open to new ideas or suggesting new genres, then the business of entertainment could attract more viewers. Netflix should include more anime and shows that can make an individual feel emotionally attached to a character or relate to the character, if Netflix attempts to do so it will benefit the company in a successful manner. What people look forward in shows is, Acting that makes the audience feel as if they are in or apart of the show and the quality or how the show was able to create a film that has much dedication and deep meaning, something that makes people motivated or question their life in a positive affect.

3,2023-08-09 15:21:34,"Hey! I absolutely love Netflix, but unfortunately we had to cancel our subscription because the price went up. I think it‚Äôs horrible that a customer for years should have to pay the new prices/month. If money is the issue, maybe implement a process of recruitment. Where you recruit a family and that person who recruits them gets extra benefits‚Ä¶more money for the company and happy customers. I‚Äôm in a 6 figure household and the fact that canceling our Netflix account makes our lives less stressful is absurd. Hopefully you all can fix this.  I would also like to mention that there are some features that should be added for a better experience. Firstly, a filter for movies you have no intention to watch (like movies in other languages). Secondly, a customer should be able to remove a film from ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù especially seeing how we don‚Äôt like watching the end credits to EVERY movie. Lastly, security is everything, so inputting a 4-digit passcode before entering Netflix should be a must! Or before you enter a profile.  I‚Äôll look into getting Netflix back in a year or two, in hopes that issues can be fixed.",MoneyMoneyMoney

I might occasionally like a foreign film, but this is the United States and I want to see good American movies that have been in the theater and that are updated on a regular basis. You should have filters that keep from showing us unwanted content. Add tags for countries, tags for ratings, and age groups etc. The stream also freezes and don‚Äôt let anyone say it‚Äôs your internet connection because I have the top package, and Prime Video still works every time Netflix freezes. Netflix says it‚Äôs having trouble showing this selection or something like that, try again later, in the middle of a movie, or right at the ending‚Ä¶ Then there is your policy of only one device. I understand you don‚Äôt want people sharing their account, but multiple devices on the same account should be allowed in one household.

I am loving the fact that new movies during COVID are being released here, and it‚Äôs the first place I check for movie nights. The only thing I wish to add is a place in my account settings to add my preferences of things I do not wish to be recommended. I will never wish to see a crime show - I understand for many it‚Äôs a hit and is always recommended on my home page. I just wish it wouldn‚Äôt show up on my home page as I know that‚Äôs one genre I won‚Äôt be open to no matter how popular. If I could simply add to my settings which genre and how often I would like to see it, I think it would make for a much better experience. Isn‚Äôt that exactly the goal Netflix aims for?

I don‚Äôt really watch new movies/series, however, for example. Monster high, there used to be a lot of them. And you guys ended up kicking all of them out. Except for 2. I got angry and disappointed. My little sister always loved watching them, now, Bratz Babies, there was A BUNCH of them, they were my favorite ever since I was 3. And yes, not in Netflix anymore. And also, Barbie. They added 7 or 8 of them, they stayed there for like 2 years, I know, it‚Äôs a lot. But still, they usually allow movies or series stay in this app for more than 2 years.

I know it's not Netflix's fault for this but sometimes it's rlly annoying and I just wanna expand on that for a second. Now say they put a really amazing show on Netflix and people absolutely like it. Netflix goes and gives the people one season then never again. That's the part that's annoying. I have an real example of a time Netflix did this:Julie and the phantoms. They gave us Julie and the phantoms with Madison Reyes. Amazing show. Netflix says it was appealing to the wrong audience, that it was meant for a younger audience. Now I get that and I understand but it means you never expand on the show and you never give a second season,that, is what I don't understand. I have another example: The haunted house. Korean anime that was absolutely amazing. Never expanded. One season. This may not have been Netflix's fault but it's still highly heartbreaking.

1,2020-03-17 14:00:13,"I avoid searching for shows on Netflix because I hate this insistence on showing parts of the movie or show when you're trying to read what it's about or are just scanning through a category. If I know what I'm going to watch, I go straight to it, and the original and international content is unmatched. But I despise being force-fed trailers and previews on any TV service, showing you before you watch what you're about to watch, and getting it in hacked up bits that reveal a lot of the best moments. And Netflix is by far the worst. So much for being surprised, thrilled and delighted by unanticipated events. A lot of us watch for the surprises and the fun in trying to guess what's coming next. Hey, Netflix, we're already on your service and intent on watching your TV and movie shows. You've got to understand that subtlety has great virtue and we're smart enough to figure out what we want to try without being shoveled bits like dummies. Besides, we also know that trailers are extensively edited, of course, and intended to show off only the best action and character lines. What we see, especially the lightening pacing and exaggerated action, is often not what we get. The previews don't reflect the quality of a production and may turn us off to things we'd otherwise try.",Can't stand the constant previews

The problem is Netflix puts out too many too fast. Viewers can not keep up so shows might not get watched for years after they were created. Therefore Netflix doesn‚Äôt get the feedback fast enough about what viewers like and dislike. Shows that are really good end up getting canceled and shows that are not good continue. No one likes getting hooked on a show, watching a few seasons, then it just ends with no explanation only to find out it was canceled last year! Example...Santa Clarita Diet. Great show with the perfect cast. Invested 3 seasons to find out Netflix canceled it almost 1 year ago. Just seems like if Netflix focused more on quality instead of quantity when it comes to their originals, viewers would have a much better experience. Other than that, Netflix is awesome.

Some of these include The Office, Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, Reign, Miraculous, How to Train Your Dragon, and others. This was the main factor in my decision because without these shows it is simply not worth my money, and I only renewed my subscription to watch Shadow and Bone, although I think I will just buy it later on Apple.

Which brings up (2) rewinding more than once will cause video to freeze so I need to close and reopen the show (this gets annoying when it‚Äôs near the end of an episode so it opens the next one instead). And I need to rewind more than once very often because of the first bug. An example of this scenario is if I pause video and resume. Then it shows the current subtitle, but then the subtitle after is skipped. So I need to rewind back twice, which causes the video to freeze.

Between butchering the Witcher and Winx, and most definitely butchering Avatar: The Last Airbender after ousting the original creators because they wouldn‚Äôt kowtow to your pinhead producers that just can‚Äôt seem to get over their hatred for source materials, this subscription is being cancelled the moment prices go up.

1,2019-03-27 03:22:30,"Used to be our go-to app for streaming even though we subscribed to others.  Content was great, navigation was intuitive, and the app worked exceptionally well.  Unfortunately all of the above has changed. We rarely watch it. The content has taken a real dive in quality. Fewer quality movies, too much reality tv trash, and too much low quality foreign programming (the better quality stuff is on a different streaming service).  There used to be a rating system in the app that affected the kinds of shows that show up in your queue. Really miss that.  And the navigation changes are terrible. Talk about fixing something that wasn‚Äôt broken!!  The search tool and other functions were moved to a sidebar - as if someone said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs copy the worst elements of browser design and slap it on our app.‚Äù  And the annoying ‚Äústill watching?‚Äù window that interrupts streaming should have an adjustable setting - especially after the new April 2019 rate hike.  It will make Netflix the most expensive service we stream.  Luckily there‚Äôs growing competition in the streaming space, and 2019 is going to be a good year for new streaming services.

2,2021-07-30 01:58:01,"I have been a Netflix subscriber for years and years. There have been MANY price increases throughout the way, despite the recent lack in content beyond belief. Almost on the level of cable TV Robbery. I still paid it despite the complaints  because I have two toddlers. They watch Netflix across multiple devices throughout the house (iPads, TV, etc.). Whatever keeps them quite while we are trying to cook. When the device keeps ‚Äúerroring‚Äù out because of ‚Äútoo many streams‚Äù of the same children shows and Netflix tells me I need to disconnect the running devices and log-in and do this and do that while I‚Äôm cooking. Are you kidding me. They had the courage to send me a ‚Äústreaming and internet 101‚Äù video like I am a moron who doesn‚Äôt know how to turn on a computer.  I‚Äôm sick and tired of paying out the wazooky for every single streaming service provider. But that being said. The cost is minimal for every other service who actually provides content and lets my kids watch content without disruptions.

5,2019-04-17 20:58:15,"Netflix is one of my favorite tv providers, first to a few others. From Stranger Things to bird box, it has amazing things on it. Also, if there is a movie out in theaters that would normally cost like 30 dollars to rent, especially if it just came out, all I have to do is wait and most likely it will pop up on Netflix! And even better is after I Finnish watching that I can watch a whole bunch of other things instead of being sad that it is over. I highly recommend Netflix, it‚Äôs amazing especially for the price. The price does go up over time, but I don‚Äôt mind, as long as I can still watch Stranger Things XD! Thank you for reading this. Oh and by the way, the only bad thing kinda bad I have to say is, why do you remove such good shows?  You may have a really good show on, then like a month or two later I can‚Äôt watch it crii.

I really don‚Äôt care about fast laughs or coming soon, why I have to navigate myself to my list instead of replacing fast laughs? It‚Äôs a paid service not a social networking app. Also, there‚Äôs missing a young adult category. Basically you have to know the show titles to search. Sometimes I have to go through another app to find the show I want to watch. Just because I‚Äôm over 21 of age doesn‚Äôt means I‚Äôd like to watch some sex related show‚Ä¶ I meant I‚Äôm all for romance but purely sex? Forget about it, I‚Äôd rather watch law and order. Instead of letting people find the show before subscription, how supposed to find what I truly want to streaming?

Even big families like my own can enjoy and have their own shows and movies the kids and adults would like to watch. The app is so easy a toddler can navigate to their favorite children shows. Thanks for Stranger Things, for adding the new Transformer film and the constant flow of Marvel blockbusters.. on top of having the Flash and Arrow among other DC comics television shows. Although I would ask that the team work on list alerts on when a show or movie will be removed soon.. especially when we have it on our list.

1,2022-08-27 03:53:38,"I LOVE Netflix, but the things they have been doing lately.... I don't quite understand. First, taking off a lot of the good movies/tv shows. A lot of people including myself, have a subscription to Netflix because of the content that's on their platform. But here lately a bunch of the content that us users subscribe to see is being taken of the platform. Those movies/tv shows includes The Vampire Diaries, Criminal Minds, Halloween, The Conjuring, and much more. I don't understand why Netflix is doing this, because the content on the platform is one of the main reasons people are even subscribing to Netflix. Next, bringing ads to Netflix. I have heard rumors about Netflix bringing ads to their platform in early 2023, but never expected it to actually happen. Being one of the very little number of platforms that are ad free is an additional reason that Netflix is so popular. A lot of people like ad free services where they don't get interruptions in the middle of a good tv show and/or movie. I don't understand bringing ads to Netflix because feel that this would be bad for company revenue.  Update: I changed the rating cause you put Criminal Minds back on then took it off again.",What‚Äôs going on?

1,2021-07-14 15:20:42,"Netflix is not keeping up with the modern streaming world because it no longer supports AirPlay and does not integrate with the Apple TV app on iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS. By any standard, it‚Äôs a poor corporate decision to not put Netflix content in the Apple TV, where many go to discover new shows. In fact, I use Netflix less because and I often forget what shows are popular on there since there‚Äôs no Apple TV app integration. If Netflix just puts their shows on there, I guarantee there will be more traffic to their service.   Let‚Äôs be honest, Netflix simply believes that it is a monopoly power and that people will only use their app for content, which is far from reality. Yet, Netflix‚Äôs arrogance seems to only be costly for business with the loss of major content and the noticeable downgrade in quality of its originals. It must compete with the newest streaming platforms that are here to stay by playing nice with the devices that people use to stream their content. This should only help Netflix, not hurt it.

Finally, just to vent, but Netflix has a serious content problem. I watch most of my content on my AppleTV and Netflix seems to have a ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù strategy, where their content is only available from within their app. Most of my content is on other streaming platforms, all of which make their content discoverable from the AppleTV search.

Another thing is during my episodes the audio will completely cut, I can still see things but not hear them and I have to restart the app. Also why can‚Äôt you make a teen option as other people have stated so that people can watch like pg-13 without all the tv-ma stuff so that people can watch shows on there own account.

I‚Äôd like to be able to hit a ‚Äòskip 20 seconds‚Äô button so I can get to exactly where I left off (the scroller is just too small & inaccurate..). b.) The fact that Netflix discontinues shows/movies is a big negative. I hear this complaint - a LOT.

You should sort movies and shows by ratings like PG 13 will go in a row and TV MA there. 5. You should finish some shows. In Netflix most shows are left behind with like 3 seasons but the real show has 8. 6. You should be able to delete movies and shows from the continue list. It is so annoying. 7.

But could you please have that stuff ONLY on adult profiles? I don‚Äôt like seeing it, and I‚Äôd rather have a Watch Together profile, and still not see it much. My little siblings‚Äîwe‚Äôre talking toddlers here‚Äîsee that stuff on their profiles too. I really would like it if you didn‚Äôt have all of that. But Netflix is mostly amazing, which is why I gave it five stars, though it was close to four stars because of the inappropriate show stuff. The search bar is so easy to search stuff up, and downloading is nice too (BUT PLEASE MAKE BUNK‚ÄôD DOWNLOADABLE!!!!!!!). Netflix is cool yo. üòé",Wow!
4,2022-03-13 15:55:06,"I was scrolling through Netflix and I had a wonderful thought so I decided to act on it and write to Netflix through this review. There are plenty of times when I‚Äôm scrolling through Netflix and I am trying to avoid nudity in shows and movies. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if there were a way to toggle on and off all shows that have a specific tag instead of just the rating? For example, there are plenty of shows that are rated TV-MA and don‚Äôt have nudity that are great to watch. However, you have to filter them all yourself and check the rating before hand and it takes up a lot of time when looking for something new to view. Now, imagine if I can just go to me settings page and toggle on and off certain tags to make my browsing easier by removing shows/movies with the tag from appearing during your browsing. Now I know that doing it with every single tag would be a pain in the behind but just doing the major tags would help out a lot of people I think.  I also, want to explain what I mean by tag in the case it isn‚Äôt clear. I‚Äôm not talking about genre such as thriller, action. Etc. I‚Äôm talking about the tags associated with the rating system like nudity, extreme violence, adult content, adult language, etc.",IDEA FROM A CONSUMER/VIEWER.
3,2023-04-12 01:52:51,"Oh Netflix. I will say navigation is better on mobile than a computer - on computers when you get suggested titles there‚Äôs no easy way to rate what you‚Äôve already watched and yet in both places that presents a problem within itself - if I‚Äôve already watched something I wish you would remove it from the rows of shows and movies and the better way to do this would be to have a previously rated section where all these already rated shows can live. With all the content Netflix has the cluster of what you call organization is a huge turn off and I find myself using the platform less because of it.   Also, Netflix basically birthed the term binging so I also hate when you try to be like traditional cable and release shows by date - whoever decided this was a good idea - you don‚Äôt understand a competitive advantage when you have one as no one really likes having to tune in weekly if they also had the option of just watching all the way thru (time permitting of course). Again you‚Äôve managed to take a competitive advantage and found a way to regress to be like everyone else. Sometimes people try too hard and overlook the easy reasons why they are losing subscribers and a lot of it has to do with when you lose those core things that made you great.",Doubt anyone reads these but

But keep the resume button as well. People prob. want both! Would also like to remove the rating thumbs off of the screen while watching. It was fine where it was. I understand it helps y‚Äôall know what to keep as well as I‚Äôm sure it helps the algorithm to suggest shows I may be interested but I actually want to press it less now that it‚Äôs in my way.

This man‚Äôs response to me was ‚Äúuse the mobile app‚Äù and when I said I can‚Äôt watch on my tv he said ‚Äúno you have to pay 7.99 for another screen‚Äù  So I have to pay extra for a service because I travel for work and want my child to be able to watch at home still? This is how you treat customers that have been with you for years? I hear you loud and clear Netflix. Paying for 2 screens is not enough for you, you need more from me. I think you will find this move, and the way you are having your representatives address this with customers (rude and dismissive quite frankly) will be the end of your company.  No amount of original content games or reruns will entice people to pay for your app, when there are much better services out there for a lot less money. I actually think I pay in total for 4 other services for what you were going to charge me for your service in both of my locations.

My big issue, however, is with the currently watching area on the tv app, phone app, and website. Sure there are tons (and I mean TONS) of articles all over the web giving instructions on how to remove shows from the currently watching section that you no longer want to view, but Netflix it‚Äôs your job to provide an easier method for doing this. It‚Äôs unrealistic to expect people to go into their history and delete a millions episodes of a show just to get to the movies and whatever other shows they need to remove from that section. Just allow a space on the titles to remove them from that area. Especially for shows or movies that you try out and end up not liking. They stay there for months! Also, the app on tv plays the show or movie just when you‚Äôre trying to read the info about it and guess what?? That also adds that title to currently watching! Fix this issue please! It‚Äôs 2020!

4,2022-11-05 17:44:12,"ok i love this app a lot but i have a few minor problems. for starters there should be like a teen-tween section for kids 12-16 because it's hard to find good shows or movies for my age group that's not boring or wrong age group.  another minor problem, i find it kinda annoying how netflix only has like 2 out of 5 seasons of certain shows like just put the whole series in there instead of bits and pieces of it. personally it's not THAT bad but it's still kinda annoying. another problem,  STOP CANCELLING SHOWS!!!!!! i swear it's so annoying how i'm like halfway through a show and then it gets canceled meanwhile dumb kid shows that BARELY ANYONE WATCHES gets like 15 seasons and like 100 episodes meanwhile the show i'm halfway through gets canceled ON A CLIFFHANGER!!!! i have one good ideas to help improve the whole cancellation system. every other month have some sort of poll to like see what shows people still watch and see what people don't watch so you can cancel things without people being mad at y'all. like i said before, great app, use it daily but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider some of these ideas i feel like if they get added then your app could be AWESOME. please consider my ideas. thanks",PLEASE READ AND CONSIDER MY IDEAS
1,2019-11-13 16:13:38,"I noticed over the past year that I have been using Netflix less and have been really disappointed with their selection and layout. So I downgraded to the lowest possible billing option and have been great with it for months now. Layout: I wish that when I selected which genre I want to watch that it showed a years list. I like 90's suspense thrillers and kids holiday movies, 50's creature feature horror movies, and 80's action and comedy movies. But it's a bit hard to find with their made up titled sections and makes me waste more time searching than watching. And the search feature doesn't not show me all the movies in these keywords as only a few can fit on the search screen. Also, there movie selection in these categories aren't that much and I end up watching Crackle a lot more. Ended up watching Crackle and Freeform Channel for Halloween instead! I feel Netflix has too much Drama and Gore movies-not my cup of tea. I expected new seasons of ""Sabrina the teenage witch,"" ""Mystery Science Theater,"" and other such shows to be new and available for October but they were not. So knowing when to show new show seasons for holidays is lacking. Who needs the new ""Nutcracker"" movie in July!? Also, when am I going to see new ""Mystery Science Theater"" episodes? Love the new show!! Creature feature movies are really lacking on Netflix!! And when is the new ""Bright"" movie coming out!? This is why I downgraded.","Downgraded instead, Not watching as much"

The app is significantly easy to use, and my favorite part is their always adding more!! It‚Äôs really easy to find things that your interested in because the app takes what you have watched, and recommends similar options. Most Netflix originals are also genuinely very good!  I do have two suggestions for somethings that could be implemented in the future. My  first idea is that you could be able to follow other people. This way you could find out what your friends, family, or anyone else you know, is watching/interested in. You could find lots of great shows that you didn‚Äôt know about or watch before. My second thing is something that has been mentioned in other reviews, and that is an actual, legitimate teen section. And i‚Äôm not talking tv-7. I‚Äôm  talking quality shows, PG13/TV14, stuff like that. I think both of these ideas could help improve Netflix in the future.  That‚Äôs all I have! Overall, Netflix is a wonderful app, full of great selection, amazing viewing quality, and awesome shows, movies, documentaries, you name it",amazing!!
4,2022-05-05 00:44:22,"Hi Netflix and anyone reading this! I think Netflix should have a teens account. For me personally I‚Äôm only allowed to have a kids account and I‚Äôm sure many people can relate. To be honest some things on the kids account are good movies. But for people 10 and older that need to have a kids account need a higher selection‚Ä¶sometimes I can watch the grown up account with parent supervision but I would rather just have a my own account. Right now I barley use my kids account and watch the grown up account but some parents don‚Äôt feel comfortable. Their kid can hide their phone and could be watching  weird inappropriate things. On the grownups account most things are rated R but some things don‚Äôt need to be on there like Stranger Things  and other shows etc. But on a kids account there are things for babies or little kids like Cocomelon. There is a grown up and a kid but their needs to be an in between. I don‚Äôt understand why Tall Girl is on the kids account. If someone who watches coco melon watches Tall  Girl  they will see boyfriends and girlfriends that 2 year olds shouldn‚Äôt see. Anyway, I think their should be a teens account.

3,2021-06-25 07:40:09,"Henlo, I just wanted to write a little review because I love Netflix and have been on it since I was very little. One thing I would like to be added is a teen section. I‚Äôm almost a teenager and I love watching anime but all the good anime are in the adult section. The only anime that fits my expectations in the kids section is yu-gi-oh, card captor Sakura, and and K-ON. My parents are kinda strict with gore and nudity but all the anime‚Äôs that fit their standards are in the adults section üò≠. I think a teen section would be great for everyone because the kids section is wayyyy to kiddish and the adults section has wayyy to much inappropriate content. At least keep the teen section at PG-13 to TV-14 ( depending on the TV-14 content.) Also, I think the rating system for Netflix is kinda broken. Like Naruto and demon slayer are the same rating when demon slayer is LITERALLY ABOUT DEMONS WHO EAT INNOCENT PEOPLE AND THE ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT THEM IS TO DECAPITATE THEM!!!! At least finish the show or skim it good enough to rate it with a rating that fits the show and isn‚Äôt off so that innocent people (like me) who want to watch anime with strict parents and won‚Äôt either be traumatized from a sexual anime being rated too low and a age appropriate awesome anime being rated too high and not being able to watch it.

3,2021-02-18 16:06:43,"Dear Netflix,  I love Netflix SO much but, I do think it needs some work. First, I think there should be a teen section. The kid section is too immature for teens while some of the things in the adult section are too mature. The PG-13 and PG-14 content should be in its own section. There are also some titles that are rated TV-MA that also don‚Äôt feature much inappropriate content that could be in the teens section. I think the teen section can feature cursing, kissing, and violence but no nudity. Second, I think you should be able to lock your profile because kids can enter the adults section very easily and watch something inappropriate. Also if you share your Netflix account with other people they can enter your account and watch shows which will then give you show recommendations that you aren‚Äôt interested in or mess up the shows your watching. Third, I think you should be able to delete shows you watched but didn‚Äôt like from your Continue Watching because then a long list of TV shows and movies will line up and I think you should be able to do it from ALL devices. Fourth, I think shows shouldn‚Äôt be removed as often as they are and more shows should be added to the kids section since, its not updated as frequently as the adults section.",PLEASE READ!!!!

It‚Äôs getting really annoying, so I decided to see if other people were experiencing this bug too. So I read through a couple reviews and everyone has said the same thing that‚Äôs happening to me. I have tried ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING to fix it!! Restarting my phone and the app, logging in and logging out, and even clearing the data on my account, nothing helps!! It‚Äôs really getting on my nerves. Also, most shows are making my iPhone heat up. I was watching Haikyuu one time and I noticed that my phone was getting really hot, so I decided to unplug it and close out of the only app that was open, Netflix. About 7 minutes after I closed the app, my phone had cooled off significantly. I noticed that it was also draining my battery a lot faster than usual. It might be that my phone is getting old, but I just got it 9 months ago. Another error I noticed was that my screen was getting dimmer too.

Half of the shows it has for pictures on there I‚Äôve never even heard of, don‚Äôt like, or not even remotely related to my interests. I think that based on what that person watches. For example I love how to train your dragon I watch it all the time but there‚Äôs no icon pictures for that. I think based on that I watch that all the time it should automatically put a section for those icon pictures on mine that would be much better. There‚Äôs something else I don‚Äôt get. How to train your dragon for another example you only have the second movie and two shows on there. What about the first and third movie and the other shows how to train your dragon is a whole connected thing why not have a he whole thing on there.

In the last year, I have called multiple times with the same issues, but they rarely are able to fix it properly for longer than a few weeks before it stops working again. 10 dollars USD a month, but if their service is unusable and you ask to be compensated for the lost time, they say ‚ÄúWe will not give you free time to replace what you couldn‚Äôt use.‚Äù That is a direct quote from a ‚ÄúCustomer Service‚Äù representative.

They sort of(elaborate later) keep up to date with shows that recently add new episodes or new movies that come out, though I have some concerns. First off, I think they try too hard to push their ‚ÄúNetflix original series‚Äù stuff to viewers to the point where they remove shows and movies that people like to force them into shows like paradise PD. Believe me, it was one of my favorite shows ever, but still, they take off way too many movies that people like to rewatch often like Shrek for example. As I was saying earlier about keeping up to date with new episodes and new movie releases, they tend to be very late with the additions. Even though they do still add them when the show is relevant, it‚Äôs usually not for weeks sometimes months before they come to Netflix. Overall great app interface, wide selection to choose from, but I think their only major flaw is pushing their own stuff too far down our throats and blocking our view from other amazing shows.",Awesome app but some problems

I upgraded my account from 2 to 4 screens years ago, just so I could share my account with my sister.  Is the money Netflix will make from this new fee going to make up for what they will lose with people canceling? My sister watches Netflix because she can use my account.

Everytime it felt like I just wanted to enjoy a tv show or a movie I was always getting messages about how Netflix is yet again increasing the price‚Ä¶and now Netflix has done it again with removing free use of family sharing in different locations under the same account. They have also changed their plans yet AGAIN to make the consumer buy a service that genuinely only benefits them. They had a basic plan that most consumers bought because it was the best quality for the price and now they are completely removing that plan to make us seriously pay 20$ a month but they think it‚Äôs justified because you get your family sharing back with 4 lines! When we used to be able to do it for FREE! And the only other option is the 7$ plan with ads. Now I‚Äôm going to give my opinion on this, I would rather pay more money and not have ads but the fact that Netflix is taking their basic plan with no ads away and leaving a huge affordability and quality gap between the 2 plans is undesirable.

If there was any place where I should be able to manage my passwords and activity it should be on my device. My info (card, address, etc) is associated to my account. One can argue logging in via laptop/computer could be less secure. Especially if the web browser saves passwords and I am a user who never logs out on a computer that never locks. I at least have Two factor authentication on my phone. If I am already logged in, ask for my password or send an email to my account with a verification number. Just don‚Äôt completely strip away my ability to manage my account promptly. At the very least, I should be able to opt out/in on account management on my device via email, if necessary. This needs to be fixed. I receive phishing emails asking me to reset my password regularly. I would like to change it via app immediately, if I feel my password had been compromised.  Rating may seem too low when everything else works well. However, security should be paramount to protect your users. There is no point having a service if that service does not have safety of its customers in mind. May as well make a walkway across the freeway.",Lacks management features

OUTRAGEOUS. it should be 10 dollars or less. i love netflix but it needs more movies and shows. i would love to recommend some to netflix, but usually i dont write reviews on stuff so netflix is lucky im doing this. im 15 years old and i love to watch childhood movies but my mother shouldnt have to put up with having to pay $17 for 2 screens. that should be the amount for 3. its dumb how 1 household, only 1 person can watch it per movie. you really have to pay to watch netflix when someone else is? thats dumb and definitely needs to be looked by this company, but the good side is the movies are thriller and much more entertaining and good quality. but netflix needs to overlook at the prices on the limited screens. but yes. netflix is really good and you need to try it if you already didnt. but i hope you write a review on the screen prices. because thats DUMB.","AMAZING APP, but needs some more movies/shows!"

Some examples like F.r.i.e.n.d.s, Coraline, Suicide Squad, and Beauty and the Beast. Those are only a few. The newer shows snd movies y‚Äôall are adding just don‚Äôt catch my attention. Im sure other people agree with me as well. Also, some of the shows that y‚Äôall have, don‚Äôt have all the seasons. That just bothers me so much because I think it only has that amount of seasons, but it turns out that it doesn‚Äôt. So I just watched that show for no reason, and sometimes I really, really, really like the show and can‚Äôt seem to find it anywhere else in order to watch it. I really hope y‚Äôall consider putting some older shows/movies that were on Netflix back, or consider trying to put more seasons or all the seasons on the shows, and finally, consider putting some other shows on like Law and Order. That‚Äôs really the only one. I really like the show, I sometimes watch it on T.V but the ads always ruin it and I would want to watch it in order.

I think I might know something that will happen in season 4 of cobra Kai that you may or may not know. If you guessed a new couple then you are right! There might be some new karate lovers that love each other. Let‚Äôs go to season 3, Tori and Robbie had a little bit of time spent together. They started getting a little buddy-buddy if you know what I mean;). So in season 4, they might hit it off a bit. Like it was Sam and Miguel, then Sam and Robbie while Miguel and tori also, so why not throw in a little Tori and Robbie together in the dish. So it is pretty clear that Robbie and Tori have to get together at some point of the Cobra Kai timeline. So Netflix, I really hope you read my last review tho.

First of all, Netflix price started getting really expensive and I think it‚Äôs kind of outrageous. Second of all, I feel like there should be teen section where it is not like for kids to watch and nothing too much going on like way too much gore, blood, yet no nudity and sexual content but kissing is fine and not way too much strong language and stuff like that. Because I‚Äôm not into kids stuff nor nothing way too adult going on (I can handle gore btw), I think it would be better because some teens don‚Äôt like watching stuff for kids nor nothing way too inappropriate for teens to watch. Another reason why is that the movies and shows is being cancelled and now you can‚Äôt complete like the whole series or episodes or whatever. I don‚Äôt know why Netflix have to be expensive it could be better at the lowest $5 and the premium where you watch bonus content, uncut version of movies or more exclusive features like no advertisements at $12.

Now with the new update we can‚Äôt log into Netflix outside our own home. So watching while on the road, at work or traveling has become an issue. I understand you can set a temporary travel account, however it only works for 30 days. This has become a massive inconvenience and has just made the platform a lot harder to deal with. Now sometimes we get kicked out of our Netflix account when it‚Äôs from our own Tv or laptop.   Another huge issue, Netflix has officially now started playing ads. This was a big shock to my family. When one day we where watching a movie and a literal ad started playing in the middle of it. This bumped us out very much. There are already so many platforms that play ads and the main reason we stayed with Netflix for so long is the uninterrupted screen time. I know there is a higher subscription with no ads but I appreciated the affordability.   I am sad to say but Netflix is not how it used to be and I feel this platform is going downhill from here.

They have increased the price year after year and I keep on paying it. Whatever. Now this password sharing nonsense is where I draw the line. After Covid i had to upgrade my internet due to all the usage in my home. Kids homeschooling, I work from home, video game streaming, etc. I upgraded my router to a dual router because we were having slow internet (my area only has 2 internet carriers) so to do that I had to increase my internet bill and we have since split the house based on usage. Netflix has now told me I have to pay more money for an additional Netflix account because we are password sharing. We are in the same house. We have 2 routers because of usage and the available speeds with the only carriers in my area. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair at all. Not only that, I pay for the screens so why does it matter where they are? I am done. I hope Netflix doesn‚Äôt make another penny. This is greedy. And when the economy is going the way it is already?

However, I recently found myself without a reliable wi-fi connection, which obliged me to stream over my LTE data connection. Much to my exasperation, I discovered that Netflix has taken the patronizing approach of disabling autoplay when streaming via cellular data. I thought at first that this irritation might be remedied by a quick trip to my account page, where the playback settings are found. However, there is just one autoplay-related checkbox, which was checked. A call to customer service confirmed that autoplay is unavailable over cellular. I feel that this policy is frankly ridiculous. With the profusion of unlimited data plans on the market, one should at least be given the option of whether to disable autoplay over data rather than have Netflix unilaterally decide the matter. I am perfectly capable of monitoring my own cellular data use; I do not need Netflix or any other company to hold my hand and choose whether I get to use cellular data.

I do not find most of the shows entertaining, though there are a select few, Netflix lacks the ability to create entertaining shows and should build ideations of a well constructed plot that grasps the attention of the audience, but like I said there are some that are interesting shows. If Netflix would be more open to new ideas or suggesting new genres, then the business of entertainment could attract more viewers. Netflix should include more anime and shows that can make an individual feel emotionally attached to a character or relate to the character, if Netflix attempts to do so it will benefit the company in a successful manner. What people look forward in shows is, Acting that makes the audience feel as if they are in or apart of the show and the quality or how the show was able to create a film that has much dedication and deep meaning, something that makes people motivated or question their life in a positive affect.

There have been so many times that I‚Äôve seen an episode or a scene of a show or movie, and I wanted to scroll down to the comments to see what other people had to say.

Secondly, a customer should be able to remove a film from ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù especially seeing how we don‚Äôt like watching the end credits to EVERY movie.

4,2021-02-02 05:40:37,"Obviously Netflix is the top runner in streaming, as it very well should be. Ever since Netflix was founded it has done an amazing job delivering and never fails to disappoint. I am loving the fact that new movies during COVID are being released here, and it‚Äôs the first place I check for movie nights. The only thing I wish to add is a place in my account settings to add my preferences of things I do not wish to be recommended. I will never wish to see a crime show - I understand for many it‚Äôs a hit and is always recommended on my home page. I just wish it wouldn‚Äôt show up on my home page as I know that‚Äôs one genre I won‚Äôt be open to no matter how popular. If I could simply add to my settings which genre and how often I would like to see it, I think it would make for a much better experience. Isn‚Äôt that exactly the goal Netflix aims for? Curating the exact type of shows a person aims to watch based on their past views? I hope someone in the Netflix team sees this and gives us a full opportunity to create preferences that truly reflect our ideal entertainment preferences. Thank you! :)",Where it could improve
5,2021-10-19 22:23:28,"Not bad. Netflix is a really good app, you watch movies and series. It kinda upsets me that they take off movies. I watched them mostly everyday, turns out I ended up disappointed, one of my favorite movies has been kicked out, and they added a new one. I don‚Äôt really watch new movies/series, however, for example. Monster high, there used to be a lot of them. And you guys ended up kicking all of them out. Except for 2. I got angry and disappointed. My little sister always loved watching them, now, Bratz Babies, there was A BUNCH of them, they were my favorite ever since I was 3. And yes, not in Netflix anymore. And also, Barbie. They added 7 or 8 of them, they stayed there for like 2 years, I know, it‚Äôs a lot. But still, they usually allow movies or series stay in this app for more than 2 years. Very disappointing. I also have no idea which other apps they would put most of the movies Netflix took off.

But there isn‚Äôt many movies that are horror and that 10-12 year olds can watch on there! And it makes me disappointed that there isn‚Äôt any.

And also some of my friends are having the same problem. They want to find horror movies and stuff but they can‚Äôt find any on Netflix that are okay for 10-12 year olds to watch.

4,2023-08-07 14:36:00,"Now I love Netflix and it's nice but I wanna talk about how it gives one single season for a show and never gives another. I know it's not Netflix's fault for this but sometimes it's rlly annoying and I just wanna expand on that for a second. Now say they put a really amazing show on Netflix and people absolutely like it. Netflix goes and gives the people one season then never again. That's the part that's annoying. I have an real example of a time Netflix did this:Julie and the phantoms. They gave us Julie and the phantoms with Madison Reyes. Amazing show. Netflix says it was appealing to the wrong audience, that it was meant for a younger audience. Now I get that and I understand but it means you never expand on the show and you never give a second season,that, is what I don't understand. I have another example: The haunted house. Korean anime that was absolutely amazing. Never expanded. One season. This may not have been Netflix's fault but it's still highly heartbreaking.

1,2020-03-17 14:00:13,"I avoid searching for shows on Netflix because I hate this insistence on showing parts of the movie or show when you're trying to read what it's about or are just scanning through a category. If I know what I'm going to watch, I go straight to it, and the original and international content is unmatched. But I despise being force-fed trailers and previews on any TV service, showing you before you watch what you're about to watch, and getting it in hacked up bits that reveal a lot of the best moments. And Netflix is by far the worst. So much for being surprised, thrilled and delighted by unanticipated events. A lot of us watch for the surprises and the fun in trying to guess what's coming next. Hey, Netflix, we're already on your service and intent on watching your TV and movie shows. You've got to understand that subtlety has great virtue and we're smart enough to figure out what we want to try without being shoveled bits like dummies. Besides, we also know that trailers are extensively edited, of course, and intended to show off only the best action and character lines. What we see, especially the lightening pacing and exaggerated action, is often not what we get. The previews don't reflect the quality of a production and may turn us off to things we'd otherwise try.",Can't stand the constant previews
4,2020-03-09 19:48:34,"This review is mainly about Netflix original series. Most of them are really good! They have cool ideas for shows and spare no expense getting some of the best in Hollywood. The problem is Netflix puts out too many too fast. Viewers can not keep up so shows might not get watched for years after they were created. Therefore Netflix doesn‚Äôt get the feedback fast enough about what viewers like and dislike. Shows that are really good end up getting canceled and shows that are not good continue. No one likes getting hooked on a show, watching a few seasons, then it just ends with no explanation only to find out it was canceled last year! Example...Santa Clarita Diet. Great show with the perfect cast. Invested 3 seasons to find out Netflix canceled it almost 1 year ago. Just seems like if Netflix focused more on quality instead of quantity when it comes to their originals, viewers would have a much better experience. Other than that, Netflix is awesome. But, you don‚Äôt want to disappoint viewers or waste $ on shows being canceled or never taking off when viewers have a lot more options these days.",Netflix originals=Love/Hate

Some of these include The Office, Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, Reign, Miraculous, How to Train Your Dragon, and others. This was the main factor in my decision because without these shows it is simply not worth my money, and I only renewed my subscription to watch Shadow and Bone, although I think I will just buy it later on Apple.

2,2022-02-08 11:19:14,"The app works but without exaggerating, I run into bugs almost every time I use the app. This is because my most frequent interactions (pausing and rewinding) for watching stuff HAVE BUGS. (1) Pausing and resuming video will make upcoming subtitles skip. So I need to rewind to catch the subtitles. Which brings up (2) rewinding more than once will cause video to freeze so I need to close and reopen the show (this gets annoying when it‚Äôs near the end of an episode so it opens the next one instead). And I need to rewind more than once very often because of the first bug. An example of this scenario is if I pause video and resume. Then it shows the current subtitle, but then the subtitle after is skipped. So I need to rewind back twice, which causes the video to freeze. I really feel like Netflix should have fixed pausing and rewinding video correctly by now since these are basic parts of playing video.

When the device keeps ‚Äúerroring‚Äù out because of ‚Äútoo many streams‚Äù of the same children shows and Netflix tells me I need to disconnect the running devices and log-in and do this and do that while I‚Äôm cooking. Are you kidding me. They had the courage to send me a ‚Äústreaming and internet 101‚Äù video like I am a moron who doesn‚Äôt know how to turn on a computer.  I‚Äôm sick and tired of paying out the wazooky for every single streaming service provider. But that being said. The cost is minimal for every other service who actually provides content and lets my kids watch content without disruptions. Sad to see Netflix go down like this for my simple family, but I did thoroughly enjoy the ride.",I feel saddened and disappointed
5,2019-04-17 20:58:15,"Netflix is one of my favorite tv providers, first to a few others. From Stranger Things to bird box, it has amazing things on it. Also, if there is a movie out in theaters that would normally cost like 30 dollars to rent, especially if it just came out, all I have to do is wait and most likely it will pop up on Netflix! And even better is after I Finnish watching that I can watch a whole bunch of other things instead of being sad that it is over. I highly recommend Netflix, it‚Äôs amazing especially for the price. The price does go up over time, but I don‚Äôt mind, as long as I can still watch Stranger Things XD! Thank you for reading this. Oh and by the way, the only bad thing kinda bad I have to say is, why do you remove such good shows?  You may have a really good show on, then like a month or two later I can‚Äôt watch it crii. So instead of removing things just bring the price up a little or something... but still, I will always and never won‚Äôt be a true Netflix fan. üòÅ",Nothing bad to say but...
4,2021-11-17 00:42:11,"Yes, Netflix is somewhat essential those days, but I have to point out the app is not user friendly enough. I really don‚Äôt care about fast laughs or coming soon, why I have to navigate myself to my list instead of replacing fast laughs? It‚Äôs a paid service not a social networking app. Also, there‚Äôs missing a young adult category. Basically you have to know the show titles to search. Sometimes I have to go through another app to find the show I want to watch. Just because I‚Äôm over 21 of age doesn‚Äôt means I‚Äôd like to watch some sex related show‚Ä¶ I meant I‚Äôm all for romance but purely sex? Forget about it, I‚Äôd rather watch law and order. Instead of letting people find the show before subscription, how supposed to find what I truly want to streaming? Traditional television have a long list of famous prime time series that are well known to people, major production studios have awards winning movies every year.

EASILY.. the best and biggest selection for a cheap price. I dig the multiple profiles not just 2 or 3(new animations are cool and fresh btw). Even big families like my own can enjoy and have their own shows and movies the kids and adults would like to watch. The app is so easy a toddler can navigate to their favorite children shows. Thanks for Stranger Things, for adding the new Transformer film and the constant flow of Marvel blockbusters.. on top of having the Flash and Arrow among other DC comics television shows. Although I would ask that the team work on list alerts on when a show or movie will be removed soon.. especially when we have it on our list.

1,2022-08-27 03:53:38,"I LOVE Netflix, but the things they have been doing lately.... I don't quite understand. First, taking off a lot of the good movies/tv shows. A lot of people including myself, have a subscription to Netflix because of the content that's on their platform. But here lately a bunch of the content that us users subscribe to see is being taken of the platform. Those movies/tv shows includes The Vampire Diaries, Criminal Minds, Halloween, The Conjuring, and much more. I don't understand why Netflix is doing this, because the content on the platform is one of the main reasons people are even subscribing to Netflix. Next, bringing ads to Netflix. I have heard rumors about Netflix bringing ads to their platform in early 2023, but never expected it to actually happen. Being one of the very little number of platforms that are ad free is an additional reason that Netflix is so popular. A lot of people like ad free services where they don't get interruptions in the middle of a good tv show and/or movie. I don't understand bringing ads to Netflix because feel that this would be bad for company revenue.  Update: I changed the rating cause you put Criminal Minds back on then took it off again.",What‚Äôs going on?

1,2021-07-14 15:20:42,"Netflix is not keeping up with the modern streaming world because it no longer supports AirPlay and does not integrate with the Apple TV app on iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS. By any standard, it‚Äôs a poor corporate decision to not put Netflix content in the Apple TV, where many go to discover new shows. In fact, I use Netflix less because and I often forget what shows are popular on there since there‚Äôs no Apple TV app integration. If Netflix just puts their shows on there, I guarantee there will be more traffic to their service.   Let‚Äôs be honest, Netflix simply believes that it is a monopoly power and that people will only use their app for content, which is far from reality. Yet, Netflix‚Äôs arrogance seems to only be costly for business with the loss of major content and the noticeable downgrade in quality of its originals. It must compete with the newest streaming platforms that are here to stay by playing nice with the devices that people use to stream their content. This should only help Netflix, not hurt it.

I wasn‚Äôt made aware that when I cross the border they would be gone from my device. It‚Äôs almost a shame I was starting to love Netflix but finding out that what I want to watch differs from country too country it‚Äôs not worth the price I‚Äôm paying since I run the risk of going to another country where if I choose to take my list of Netflix to watch over there in my spare time I run the risk of my show or movie disappearing from my device.

Finally, just to vent, but Netflix has a serious content problem. I watch most of my content on my AppleTV and Netflix seems to have a ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù strategy, where their content is only available from within their app. Most of my content is on other streaming platforms, all of which make their content discoverable from the AppleTV search.

There is a ton of other shows too. Like why have the Naruto shippuden movies but not the show, I mean you have shonen jumps. Another thing is during my episodes the audio will completely cut, I can still see things but not hear them and I have to restart the app. Also why can‚Äôt you make a teen option as other people have stated so that people can watch like pg-13 without all the tv-ma stuff so that people can watch shows on there own account.

I‚Äôd like to be able to hit a ‚Äòskip 20 seconds‚Äô button so I can get to exactly where I left off (the scroller is just too small & inaccurate..). b.) The fact that Netflix discontinues shows/movies is a big negative. I hear this complaint - a LOT. Netflix, if you‚Äôre going to continue raising your prices, you need to keep shows on either INDEFINITELY (especially POPULAR shows), or give us a clear warning as to WHEN IT WILL BE LOST!

I agree with other users‚Äô complaints that you need to stop the automatic (loud) content ads, or give us the option to turn the audio OFF on them. Who needs that?

Lately, their anti-consumer rules to prevent ‚Äúaccount sharing‚Äù comes across as a large money grab.  1st off, I paid for the 4k plan to access that content and had multiple consecutive screens at a time, I never used more than 2 and 99% of the time never more than one.  The short-sided decision to limit it further by requiring devices to be on the local Wi-Fi every month is asanine.  I have a tv inside an RV that never joins the home Wi-Fi, lives on its own network.  It‚Äôs just me, if I‚Äôm in the RV I‚Äôm not at home,if I‚Äôm home I‚Äôm not in the RV.  I‚Äôm not paying for an add on when I‚Äôm the only user.  Your business model already limited account sharing by limiting simultaneous streams, which my current plan has more than I use, I have opted to cancel and spend that $22 on other, more consumer-friendly streaming services.

They don‚Äôt even give you a chance or a few days it‚Äôs automatically account on hold, update payment smh! Why does every other app have the new seasons of shows before them and yet Netflix is more expensive?! Why does Netflix lie about the amount you supposed to pay? Why doesn‚Äôt anyone from Netflix ever respond or seem to care about their reviews? They seem to think since everyone will continue putting up with them they‚Äôve gotten to comfortable and rich off of us where they feel they don‚Äôt need to!!! I Guarantee that‚Äôs what it is!

1,2021-05-01 21:01:05,"I have never had a problem with streaming Netflix through google play to my tv, but this last week has been so unbelievably frustrating. For the last week, any time a try to stream or even just watch any show, the shows don‚Äôt save to my recently watched or continue watching list. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. Every time I wanted to watch a show, I have to search is and remember what episode I was on. Then suddenly, while streaming from my account, I realized on my tv is said I was streaming from my moms account. I thought I was accidentally on her account, but no. The show selection was on my account, however my tv was connected to hers. When I went to her account, there we all of my shows that I had been searching for. My mom even asked me why I was using her Netflix and messing up all of her shows. I cannot fix it. I updated the app. I deleted and redownloaded the app. Every single time I use my account, the shows end up in my moms account and I have no clue why. Please fix this bug, or tell me a way to fix it. There‚Äôs a reason I pay almost 20$ a month for Netflix, so everyone can watch on their own on their own time.",So Frustrated
5,2018-12-16 13:45:38,I don‚Äôt know if this happens to anyone else but every time I watch a Netflix original show ( made by Netflix) it will play for a little bit and then it will freeze on one image and the audio will keep playing and I either have to Press the skip button four times or go out of the app and restart and it is super frustrating because it happens to every Netflix original show for example it happens watching free Rein and nailed it and fuller house. And this only happens on my phone when I watch it on my tv it‚Äôs perfectly fine. I am not sure if it‚Äôs just my phone but it just doesn‚Äôt make sense that it only happens to Netflix original shows and it‚Äôs super annoying especially because are usually watch them on my phone and not the TV because it‚Äôs more convenient but it will always freeze and I have to skip it or restart every time and when it freezes it will freeze about four times in one episode,Netflix original shows freezing
4,2021-09-19 20:53:39,"I watch Netflix alot.. i spoken to a-lot of people that watch just as much as me. We all are wondering when will Netflix allow us , ON THE APP to see our previous watch history! Something so simple and easy as to be able to see a history of all the titles you watched would be great! The moment you finish a show, movie or series it disappears from the ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù section. Some people like myself might forget a few weeks later and wonder ‚Äúwhat the name of that show I was watching‚Äù and go in the Netflix app and you cant even find a Previously watched section, or a completed section. I think you should add this in, and I know you might say we have to log into the Netflix website directly to see what you previously watched, but for one, that way is tedious, not helpful and time consuming. Its 2021 people use Netflix the APP! Not Netflix the website. Hopefully someone at Netflix reads this and agrees with me. Well back to watching my show now. Lol",Suggestion
3,2022-01-07 07:06:34,"Alright, so i have a tv in my room and decided to watch a movie. We have 5 different accounts and a rule for netflix is that only 5 devices can play at the same time. I tried to watch the movie but it had said that there was too much devices playing at the same time. I was confused because it had said only 4 accounts were playing. I then tried to go onto my phone and it instantly let me watch a series/movie. Also.. i HATE how netflix cancels good movies or series. They should put a voting option for the viewers if they want it still be kept in netflix. They also replace the series/movie with bad ones that have bad acting or no plot. OR they keep the bad movies etc and cancel good ones. If they still had a few movies and series i would use it 24/7 but not i only use it once a month and just find the series/movie some else where. I also dont like how people who are signed into the netflix account can just randomly log into my account and watch series. I wish you can put a password in",Its good but needs fixing

However, I would like to recommend some little changes to make someone‚Äôs experience with the app even better. 1. Please add some more teens variety!!! There is really only Adults and Kids and it‚Äôs hard for young teens like me for when I need a good show to watch without having it TVMA or TVY. 2. You should really consider group steaming! Some others have done this such as Disney plus but it‚Äôs really helpful a specially in the pandemic where my friends can‚Äôt just come over and watch a movie with me. 3.

Even my little brother understands ( and he‚Äôs a Netflix person.) !  My brother loves Sonic, for example, and I know there is the new series on Boomerang or Cartoon Network, called ‚Äú Sonic Boom‚Äù , and that‚Äôs when I realized, why isn‚Äôt the new series on Netflix? Also why aren‚Äôt you adding more seasons to series as well? My brother used to like Lego Ninjago and I know they have like a season 6, 7, 8 etc. , so why not put that on, for instance? And please don‚Äôt take away any old shows or movies that other reviewers have talked about! I love Netflix, and others do too. So why not do what they want? Having all the episodes everyone loved!

1,2023-06-19 08:18:29,"In its attempt to squeeze every last penny out of their customers, Netflix has decided to sacrifice efficiency and convenience for corporate greed. Where before we could pay for an account that we could share as a family to no cost of the company, my siblings and I who have moved out have to juggle reconnecting our accounts to our home wifi to ensure we actually get to continue watching the content we're paying for. What finally ruined Netflix for me was trying to cast a show from my phone onto our TV and being met with an error message that told me I would also have to sign in on the TV to DOUBLE make sure that Netflix wasn't being ""cheated"" out of another account. I have Netflix on my phone; I can watch it no problem, especially after connecting to our home wifi. The audacity to continue to make obstacles to just watching a show in order to protect corporate interests is way too much effort for the occasional good show Netflix puts out. There are now a dozen other streaming services that have no problem with a family sharing an account; Netflix just isn't special anymore.",Another corporation brought low by their greed
4,2021-05-08 00:56:43,"I honestly love Netflix, but I would recommend adding more seasons to a few shows. For example, let‚Äôs take Haikyu!!, Kuroko‚Äôs Basketball, and Food Wars! Shokugeki No Soma. Haikyu!! Has been on Netflix for a while now. And it still two season on Netflix when Haikyu!! Has four seasons. It also has some movies, but those aren‚Äôt on Netflix either are they? Now, Kuroko‚Äôs Basketball was just recently released on Netflix in January (If I remember correctly). And season 2 is coming May 15th? Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do love Kuroko‚Äôs Basketball, but I would also appreciate it if Haikyu!! Season three and four were released as well. And well, the same goes for Food Wars! Shokugeki No Soma. Which has about five seasons I believe. And Netflix only has 2. That goes for those 3 and many more. (I am a very big anime fan as you can tell).

So my question is and comment is why don‚Äôt you bring back some of the old shows that people have written millions of reviews just to bring back? And if you got an answer for this which I am pretty sure you won‚Äôt cover I am wondering why there are so many comments with very very bad reviews why you haven‚Äôt fixed any of it, you have all the time in the world now so I just wonder why you don‚Äôt bring back old shows that people want to rewatch and relive desperately but you decide that shows like oh I don‚Äôt know the one I‚Äôve written three reviews about the haunting hour that was an incredible show me and my cousin and some of my friends loved watching it but you didn‚Äôt bring that back in the matter how many reviews I wrote why, I don‚Äôt know but there are so many reviews that you don‚Äôt seem to read about bringing back old shows you rarely do that and some people have been deleting your app because it‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs charm and doesn‚Äôt provide actually good shows anymore",Do you read any reviews?!

Second, I get the Netflix originals are meant to tempt people to get Netflix for certain shows, but they need quality over quantity. Nobody cares about how ever many shows or movies that are originals, people care a lot more about a few movies and shows that are really good and have a large following. Lastly, this kind of goes with the second one, but we need more original movies and shows that everybody knows and loves. For example, Polar Express, I Am Legend, Spongebob, and many others I can‚Äôt think of right now.

4,2022-08-06 01:44:36,It‚Äôs great but I honestly think there should be a teenage section I would help because I search for hours and can‚Äôt find anything in My age group. I personally like romantic movies and films and it upsets me that half of them are grownup ones I honestly don‚Äôt mind that but there should be more teenage love. I also think there should be more pride movies you have a lot of romantic movies with straight people I feel like there should be more because there love matters just as much and they have good meanings to them and teach a lesson. Recently I watched a movie called hidden kisses and it should get lesson out there because hating on your own child for making there own Decisions it can affect them more then you know one person judging them could make them want to end there life.

4,2018-11-12 20:42:05,"I've changed my rating to 4 stars, as you've restored descriptions to the app. It's so much easier to tell if something would be interesting to me! So many more new things added to my list now.  It's still only 4 stars instead of 5, for 2 reasons:  1) It's still buggy/laggy. There are times that, for no discernible reason, I try to load a show - or even just hit the ""10 seconds back"" button - and it never, ever loads. I often have to quit the app and restart it and, in extreme cases, switch off the iPad and restart it. This should be a rare-if-ever occurrence, not a fairly common one.  2) I, like many other commenters, preferred the ""star"" rating system - both because of my own reactions to various films/shows, but also for the algorithm it used: I could look at how a show was rated by others, and get a pretty good idea of whether or not it would be worth my time to check out. Since moving to ""thumbs up/thumbs down"", not only do I not bother to rate any movie I don't specifically love, but I have no idea what algorithm it's using to determine whether or not I'd like it. It's usually pretty off in its estimates now anyway; I'm guessing it makes assumptions based on categories or something?  Overall, the app is decent. Its algorithms are weird, and it can be hard to know what Netflix has to offer without specifically searching for it as it doctors its display to what it thinks I want to see, but the app is mostly functional.",Thank you for restoring descriptions!

I know, it's crazy thinking but seriously???  I love Netflix and it's choices. It's opened my world to new genres that I wouldn't have normally paid any attention to.  Who knew it would be so much fun to watch British bakers? The app itself is fine but I do have a few things I would like to see changed.   Please give us control over the continue watching section.  Twice when I watched the last show of a series, a new series that I didn't choose (change number 2, don't automatically start a new anything other than a trailer) started automatically and now I can't get it off of of the list.

I love the download feature which I use ever time I fly home for break. But there are some things I hope they'll consider changing. For starters let's talk about this audio description thing. I don't understand why it's the default option on my phone and there's no way to change it. I would appreciate if you added an option to change the default language setting so I'm not constantly having to switch while I'm binge watching. Secondly, the ratings system needs to return to the star system. The thumbs up and down system is to broad and I can't imagine it helps the algorithm that lists potential movies and shows I would like. If I was only lukewarm about the movie then liking it would only show more movies I wouldn't like and disliking it might hide the ones I might like.

One of the new features that I would like you to include in the Netflix interface is that you implement two 10-second buttons in order to delay and advance a series or movie since you can not currently do so, I would also like to be able to set a default playback quality either 720p, 1080p or 2160p so that when you start the title start at the quality you chose. A problem that I just noticed in a series is that House of Cards does not have the option of omitting intro and that intro is very long, the button does not appear to omit intro in any of my devices in the House of Cards series. I hope you solve it for the next update and take my words into account. Thank you",Very upset with the Netflix weekly updates on iOS devices

But now look at you, you guys cancelled numerous series, shows, and movies, that we all loved and could watch over and over and over again without getting bored. You guys air great shows and all of a sudden that become discontinued. I will not be surprised if you guys lose 37% of your watchers in these years that may come. I am very devastated to see that some shows that I love watching won‚Äôt have a next season. It also breaks my heart that some good movies that some people haven‚Äôt seen were taken off of Netflix. Now those new subscribers that you may gain won‚Äôt have the opportunity to watch those amazingly well out movies because you took them off. I understand that you guys may take off movies or series to put in new ones, but instead of taking away the shows they love take other shows that people don‚Äôt find you amusing.

I remember when I could watch a movie, rate it, and then new movies would appear that may or may not be similar. The point Im making is after watching a movie I‚Äôm wasn‚Äôt constantly searching for a movie because new ones would pop up as long as I was watching.

1,2023-10-04 14:19:49,"This streaming platform had already started to lose a lot of quality shows and fill up with very low quality, low rated movies and TV shows. The streaming platform began relying on a few shows like Stranger Things to hold it together (especially after certain shows like breaking bad ended or the walking dead which kind of fell off). The household feature, however, is the reason I‚Äôm leaving this review. I am a college student living several hours away from my family and it doesn‚Äôt take this into account. It would rather force me or my family to pay double for this platform which already went up in price to 16 dollars. I‚Äôve seen you can add another person for 8 dollars but it isn‚Äôt worth spending over 20 dollars a month when there‚Äôs plenty of other platforms that allow both my family and I to stream shows.

4,2018-05-01 08:50:12,"I love the format of the app. Every aspect is meticulously put just to make you have a better time. However, I have two issues. First, the movies. There are many movies that I see in which are unavailable in my country or have been removed and only available in other countries. I think this is a problem. For example, White Chicks. I had been looking forward to rewatching White Chicks, but then I had seen it was removed. I hope that they don‚Äôt remove these from our country anymore because I really enjoyed some shows that had used to be there but are not now. The second is not a big issue, but I believe it is something the people of Netflix can fix easily. Why is there only a way to move back instead of forward. It takes me a painful time to go and try to move forward a little. Instead, it just skips a minute when I only wanted to go 20 seconds ahead.

1,2018-04-16 03:27:12,"I strongly recommend when setting up Netflix services to do it straight through the Netflix web site  and avoid this app when subscribing, signing up any new member ship through this  Apple iTunes app. Reason being is Netflix is under strict contracts terms with Apple iTunes which limits capabilities to canceling your account, modifying payments or adjustments. Apple iTunes has full control over those specific things under contract terms. With majority of the consumers this is a very important factor. I personally had to learn the hard way. I followed the terms, canceled my subscription 24hrs before the billing date, and Apple iTunes still tried billing me another month. I received a email from Apple stating there was a billing issue. Shortly after I called Apple and clearly canceled 24 hrs before the billing date explaining the reason there is a billing issue. I was told I would have to pay for another month of service and that It wasn‚Äôt 24hrs before cancellation.

I was wondering if you would create a similar heading, or put the leaving soon titles underneath the New and Hot tab. I don‚Äôt think it would be hard to do. This would be greatly appreciated.

I would go to look for the exact titles (Lucifer is the only one i remember off the top of my head) but i doubt im logged in to even look. it cost 7.99 to login to watch on a different wifi. im a COLLEGE STUDENT, i now cannot use the service only an hour away unless i wanna pester my mom for the pin (this has not been effecient as u only get 15 minutes before it expires) and it does not make sense for me to pay that especially when i rarely find anything to watch. this ontop of the new option to ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô for better quality tv while my family is paying either standard or premium (15-20 bucks) ontop of wanting 7.99 for each extra member. unreasonable when other services provide the same/more movies as well as ones removed for cheaper. safe to say i havent been on netflix in a while.","Poor selection, new update."
4,2020-08-17 19:38:37,"I absolutely LOVE Netflix, I find myself spending most of my time in quarantine watching netflix. I watch everything from movies to stand ups to series. I love how Netflix constantly is adding new shows. Sadly, I had to rate 4 out of 5 because some of my favorite shows and movies are not on netflix. The series I am talking about is The Wayans Bros. The movies I‚Äôm talking about are Stomp the Yard, Battle of the Year, and Think Like a Man. I do understand Netflix can‚Äôt have every movie or every show, but this did disappoint me. If Netflix added some of these or similar to what I listed I would be thrilled! If they got added my rating would be at 5 stars. If Netflix isn‚Äôt able to get them I do understand, though I would be a little sad. My rating would have to stay at 4 stars. Netflix is still amazing though, Like I said, I watch netflix for an average of 5 hours a day! Sometimes even more than that! Netflix is incredible, hope my review gets read and considered!",Awesome

The anime I watch is like my hero academia , the disastrous life of saikik,attack on titan, and kurokos basketball. And the reason you should put more stuff like these animes is because they‚Äôre the interesting ones. Like the disastrous life of saikik actually in has the the characters talking to the writer. And how attack on titan has that dip like when you think it is over but it‚Äôs not because there is more and they have mystery‚Äôs. And that is why you should put more anime.

5,2020-07-27 03:44:18,This is the perfect app for movies and shows but teens are on here to. Most of the movies are to childish or to adultish and mostly crap either toddlers watch or elderly people or adults watch . They need to put out more teen drama movies. I have had netflix for like 1 year and i have watched every teen drama movie there is. I get that it is mostly adults out there watching netflix. But y'all need to put more teen dramas back on. And i just found out that other country's have more shows and movies. My favorite show in the world is pretty little liars . The only place i could watch it was on Netflix. They ended up removing it but Germany and canada still have it. And as soon as movies come out they should be put on netflix if its not a netflix origanal. Like some movies came out 8 months ago and are just now being put on netflix. That is all i had to say but over all it is a good app.,Teens and pre teens deserve more

It‚Äôs just something small, but I miss being able to just tap the screen to check the time. If there was a way to make that display optional or always there, I‚Äôd love that.  Also I don‚Äôt understand why you can only download things a couple times. If you‚Äôre rewatching a show and are going somewhere without WiFi, you might not be able to download that episode you‚Äôre on if you already downloaded it the last times you watched it.

2,2022-07-31 05:29:50,Netflix in general caters to what they assume are the masses whether it be teenage masses or Marvel masses but now you‚Äôre going into the Middle East and you‚Äôre very one-sided in your approach The Israeli series or films that you show are always violent for example hit-and-run and the one prior with this film it‚Äôs all not just one sided but contradictory you have terrorism on the side of the Israelis why would they attack a town saying that there were terroristic attacks from it if nothing happened if everything was peaceful they have better things to do Then there‚Äôs a love story of course the woman is virginal I‚Äôm sure when she gets married and she would never fool around on her husband who is in detention for not very clear reasons and the whole thing is just fantastical there‚Äôs no anything in it that resembles the conflicts there I know I spent most of my teenage &. beginning adult years in the Middle East during the conflicts alluded to and that means Lebanon Syria Jordan Egypt and Israel-do you want to talk about the Middle East then show both sides not angelically but fairly,Pomegrantes and myrrh
4,2019-06-15 07:13:22,Ok a lot of people complain about shows being removed but in reality this is not the worst of it. As an example total drama lost 2 of its seasons without so much as a mention they were gone and this Is not the only show this is happing too. I would list them all but that would take all day. Also stop removing shows as that really makes it hard to enjoy Netflix when are there all is trendy shows that some like. And a lot of the shows being removed and shortened some will say it is because there old but there are shows from like 1991 here and your removing 2000 shows this is a bad thing to do because soon that will be your adult audience and when they wanna watch there child hood shows they won‚Äôt be there and they will stop using Netflix. In short please add back the removed seasons of some shows at least but I recommend bringing it all back and the movies too which your also removing a lot of,Good but needs to get better
3,2020-03-21 01:36:39,"Netflix is great, because I can stream my favorite shows and movies anywhere, anytime. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that it is completely problem free. I have two issues with the app. The first one is the obvious one. Allow me to spell it out for you: NETFLIX NEEDS A TEEN SECTION. You have a section for adults and one for kids, so what the heck is so hard about making a teen section?? It could have cartoons like The dragon prince and the she-ra reboot (which is really good) While also having the live action series like A series of unfortunate events. It could also have the movies in the kid‚Äôs section that are PG and PG-13, like some marvel movies. But nothing MA or R rated, because that will ruin everything. Please consider this.  My next issue is that once I accidentally deleted the app and once I recovered the app, it wouldn‚Äôt let me redownload my movies and shows because I  ‚Äúreached the yearly download for them.‚Äù  I was both frustrated and confused by this and wonder if I can ever redownload everything again.

Which is a misnomer, made in our time to only mean incredibly babying.

Netflix used to show all the Equestria Girl movies and 8 out of 9 of the My Little Pony friendship is magic seasons. But, then Netflix took out all the Equestria girls moves and 4 seasons out of the series. Another example most of the Barbie movies were taken out. They were really funny for me and a big part of my life. My little sister is really sad that she did not finish the my little pony movies and series before you took them out.

I recommend Netflix because it's really good, and there's no way you've seen EVERY movie or show on Netflix, so theres a lot to watch. The best part about Netflix is that there are no commercials, and you can watch what you want offline. People who like to binge watch, or watch moives and stuff like that, will certainly love Netflix.

2,2021-03-18 17:17:03,"When Netflix first started, the concept was great even though it wasn‚Äôt perfect. Lots of content although a lot of it was outdated.  The one feature they took away that bothers me and is rapidly becoming a showstopper is the feature that let you choose the type of content you will see.  Half the movies that are on there now are foreign with no English or content I am not interested in.   Netflix should absolutely carry films such as those for people who are interested in those films, but if we are going to pay for them, their should be a choice of what we see in the menu.   Obviously there should be a settings page to allow us to select the choices we want and don‚Äôt want, especially where our children are concerned.  Stop force feeding content based on political, social, or sexual views.   No, I don‚Äôt have to watch them; that is true. But I pay for the service and since Netflix had once had the good sense to let us personalize our content page (even though it wasn‚Äôt perfect), they should still offer that choice.  Also, most of the new movies are Netflix films and the rest are generally old movies or something I haven‚Äôt heard of.  Other than that, there is a lot of good content on Netflix and the price (even though it‚Äôs no longer $7.99) is still inexpensive; however, due to everything I stated above, am finding it harder and harder to justify keeping it because I‚Äôm running out of content I find interesting or something I want to watch or suitable for my kid.",Changed too much

But when you have your phone propped up on a surface it isn‚Äôt ideal to pick your phone up just to play with the volume. Instead having a little onscreen tool to just quickly adjust would be absolutely amazing!  Other than that great app! Just wish that certain shows and movies weren‚Äôt getting constantly removed :(",New features.

There are many great shows and movies on there, as well as originals (i.e. ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù, ‚ÄúLove, Death & Robots‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù, etc). This mobile app‚Äôs ability to download certain shows and movies is also pretty genius. My one suggestion for improvement though is that a shuffle button would be a great addition to Netflix. If ever you can‚Äôt find a show or movie to watch, you could ‚Äúshuffle all‚Äù and it would pick something random for you to watch. Or you could sort by categories, for example, and it would choose a certain comedy, action show, etc for you to watch. This could also come in handy if someone were re-watching a show (like ‚ÄúThe Office, ‚ÄúParks and Recreation‚Äù, ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù, etc), and couldn‚Äôt decide on a specific episode.   All in all, something that‚Äôs absolutely worth the download, but could be even greater with a shuffle button!",How bout a shuffle button?
4,2022-04-23 12:50:27,"So when I‚Äôm in picture-in-picture mode, there are a couple errors. 1) When in picture-in-picture mode, sometimes the Netflix screen will turn black. Even if I disable the mode, the screen is still black. What‚Äôs weird is that audio will still play. So I have to exit the episode and then open it again. It‚Äôs not really that big of a deal but a fix would make it a lot easier. 2) Also when in picture-in-picture mode, when the credits start to roll, it plays the credit music and the intro music overlapping each other. This can definitely get annoying and happens to me often when in picture-in-picture mode. It only shows the credits screen however-and the screen goes black if I go back into normal mode. Honestly, if you could fix these two issues, it would definitely help me keep watching Netflix smoothly.","Great, but some bugs."
1,2023-08-10 06:49:24,"So I received an email telling me a computer from Argentina signed into my account. I live in USA. I went to Netflix and deleted all the sign in that I noticed wasn‚Äôt me. I changed my password and then logged out to sign in to start fresh after all the changes I made. It wouldn‚Äôt let me sign in with my new pw. I contacted Netflix and they said there was an account takeover so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sign in. Ok, I checked my credit card statement and there is definitely a charge from Netflix on there made on July 28. I‚Äôm paying for the service but not allowed to use it? How ridiculous is that? The parasite sign in I‚Äôm sure is still able to use my account. Wow just wow. Good job Netflix. You deserve 0 stars. The agent who was chatting with me to help solve the issue didn‚Äôt even explain how or when the account would be made available. Also, he wouldn‚Äôt let me cancel my account. After this I am definitely weary of how Netflix handles situation. It feels limited and not supportive. May one day soon a better version of a tv/movie subscription be made available that is NOT NETFLIX.",ridiculous

4,2020-04-20 21:33:28,"Netflix is the best in my opinion, but all i ask for is to add more movies! Some of the movies on Netflix are old and boring or some are for older people (adults) and some of the kid/teen shows are not very interesting, The scary movies are pretty cool its just that I wish like seriously wish IT was on Netflix, It cost money to watch it which I think is stupid, the only way to watch it for FREE is if you have a Fire Box which I don‚Äôt have one, Thats why I think it should be on Netflix but lets get onto another movie, I‚Äôve been really into mean girls and I really wanna watch it, but again you need to buy it to watch it which i think is stupid because its an old movie and it should be free, but you know, cant always get ur way but it would be awesome to be on Netflix, But so far Netflix is pretty good and its easy to watch movies and I love the app a lot, im just saying- everything I said is my opinion but this is just what i wanted to say so yeah.",Other Movies
5,2021-04-27 22:20:29,Y‚Äôall act like shows are getting canceled because of the Hype House when a show gets canceled because they can‚Äôt make it anymore because it would be boring or repetitive like on my block because like they are gonna graduate high school and everyone except maybe Cesar are gonna leave the ‚Äúhood‚Äù or because not enough people watch it so they are not gonna waist money on a show people don‚Äôt like and seeing how popular the Hype House is it‚Äôs a big opportunity for Netflix and the Hype House has this big opportunity with one of the biggest streaming service in the world that made streaming services popular in the first place obviously they would take that opportunity to grow their brand and also make more money I‚Äôm sorry but the world is money and if you can‚Äôt accept that and are upset that is on you,You need to read this
3,2019-04-02 04:27:10,"As someone who‚Äôs been with Netflix since I was getting DVDs in the mail, ALL I‚Äôve been waiting for is a way to filter/organize/ alphabetize MY LIST. I don‚Äôt need random shuffling orders or 300+ added items to scroll through. I just need to separate TV shows from movies because I‚Äôll probably fall asleep in an hour or just add new things to my list.  Or have them organized by category. Sometimes I‚Äôm in the mood for a mystery. Sometimes I want a comedy. Sometimes I had coffee and want to try and binge 50 episodes of a Korean drama in a weekend... sometimes I want to put my phone down and pay attention to subtitles.  And maybe too much to ask, but the majority of my ratings are 3 stars because they‚Äôre ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. Neither thumbs up or thumbs down. Is there like a sideways thumb rating...? Cuz otherwise I don‚Äôt rate anymore. I have more ideas- ability to post what you‚Äôre watching/ share/discuss what episode you‚Äôre on with others without spoiling anything because you know they watched it too?",Needs filters
5,2019-08-21 04:53:09,"I was thinking that there should be something that tells you if something new happens to MY LIST. For example the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Official: Another Season Is Coming‚Äù Only as a notification. Another example would be when the new episodes come out on something in MY LIST, that could be a notification. I know that there is already a notification thing on the app but I don‚Äôt care about the other shows that I don‚Äôt watch. I mean I like how it shows new arrivals. And you could just do my suggestion like that. Notification space in the app has new arrivals and anything new about any shows in MY LIST. But again I don‚Äôt care about the other shows I don‚Äôt watch. But for people who want notifications of course. Thank you anyways for reading my suggestion! I hope you don‚Äôt take anything to offense. Thank you again for reading this!",Some thing that would make Netflix better
3,2023-07-15 14:08:24,"i cant remove a show out of my continue watching list and its making me upset. although Netflix is really good it has some bugs. i want to clear my continue watching because it is STUFFED. my Netflix lags because my continue watching list has more than HALF all the Netflix series and episodes. Netflix helps me with boredom and thats one of the good things, but Netflix also needs internet to watch. i understand why it needs internet but whats the real reason to it? extra money? payment? it should be a no internet thing in my book. on a scale from one to ten based of Netflix and how it works would be a 5.5/10 and i rarely give 2‚Äôs. one of my other pet peeves is that Netflix REMOVES all the good tv shows, movies, and that makes it boring. they have to add more things in the US version of Netflix from the UK version. speaking of Netflix in the UK, i do not get why the UK gets more shows, and movies than the US Netflix.",cant remove show from watch list
3,2023-03-18 19:34:27,"First of all, Netflix has good shows and all, but something I don‚Äôt get is that they take off shows literally like 1 year of them being on there and for other shows they stay on for 2+ years, another thing about Netflix is that they never update some shows, like some shows are already finished and ended but on Netflix they only have like season one on there or something it‚Äôs really frustrating how they care about more shows than others, they update all these other shows but not popular ones that Netflix knows that they are going to bring up when they send a review, I am disappointed of what Netflix has became over the years, I barely even use this app because there‚Äôs literally nothing that‚Äôs actually updated to watch. I‚Äôm about to delete Netflix. And then your app is really laggy, like when you start a movie, and even tho you have internet it proceeds to glitch every 5 seconds! So disappointed, man.",Meh
