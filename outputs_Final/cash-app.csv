Enter it after it asks for your number. If you‚Äôve already signed up you can enter the reward coupon on the profile menu if you scroll to the very bottom. The service itself exceeds the competition found in PayPal and Venmo in its ease of use. Sign up is super easy and very convincing for friends, particularly when out to dinner in San Francisco where asking the waiter to split a bill is like pulling out your teeth. I like the fact that I can send money to anyone even if they haven‚Äôt signed up with Square yet. The app is simple to use, swift and clean. There are two options for transferring money to your bank. Either instant deposit which takes a small fee, or the next day. Or you can keep the money in your account, and use the square debit card for any online purchase. You can even request a sleek looking physical debit card and use that anywhere. The app itself seems secure, especially with the touch ID integration for quick payment. This app has changed how I exchange money with friends or even new acquaintances!! I‚Äôve even started using it to pay rent directly to my landlord. Welcome to the new modern era. Square cash is now my go to for quick payment transfers to friends and family. Overall you should definitely give it a try, especially with the $15 bonus it gives you!!!!",Great app!

5,2023-04-01 01:26:04,"I have had CashApp for 5-7 years now. I have direct deposit from my job to my cashapp. I have done my taxes through cashapp for years as well. I have never had any kind of issues with cashapp. And when I have had issues with other companies or purchases, CashApp customer service was 100% on my side. CashApp also has a borrow feature now where you can basically get a quick loan if you ever have an emergency or just need some extra cash fast. No hassle or background checks. Quick and easy, I‚Äôm your account in less than one minute! And it will allow you to borrow several hundreds of dollars (depending on how long you have had your account, and how much you keep in it). CashApp also has a savings account! You can do round ups on every purchase and save the change automatically in your savings account! I cannot express enough how easy/simple this app is! And I used it heavily for EVERYTHING! I never have to touch real money anymore since using CashApp. Oh, and unlimited atm withdraws from select atms (they have a map to show you where to go). Again, I like this app for all my banking needs. It‚Äôs easy to use, and has so many perks! (I forgot to add that you can add ‚Äúboosts‚Äù to your card for % off purchases, or bitcoin earning, and even cash back!) I even set one up for my kids! Easy to transfer cash when they need it and are away from home. Easy to send them their allowance also. I 100% recommended CashApp!!!",Highly recommend!!!
5,2021-08-23 03:52:51,"I love this app! I have 4 kids and they borrow and pay me back. I sell a lot of items and use it for taking payments from my renters.  It can categorize each person and the payments I‚Äôve made to them & the payments I have received from them. I can pull up one person & look at the entire account. It allows you to state what the money is for so u can keep track of it. PayPal which is not free! I do not use now. I have Zelle, however, it does not keep track of how much Is paid or received. You can not pull up an individual to see all the transactions for the one person.  Which is what I love about the cash app! I was able to keep track of how much I paid for my daughter‚Äôs wedding. Her dress, shoes, veil, hair, nails, and all the decorations.  I was able to keep track of how much I spent.  I could pull her name up and look at everything that I had spent on her and her wedding. üòäüòä I love that it is free!! No fees! I have my renters pay me using the cash app. It‚Äôs easy to track who has paid and how much to date!  When I‚Äôm selling something and they want to use the cash app to pay me. I can send them a link and I make money because I sent them the link so when they download the cash app and pay for items that I have for sale, cash app sends me a bonus! It stated out at $5.  I am now up to $15 per person that uses my link to the cash app. That‚Äôs awesome! I love that bonus!",Cash app is a must! The best app to have!
4,2022-12-07 04:48:28,"After using the app for a couple years, I have had a pretty positive experience, I use direct deposit and use it as my main source of managing my funds. I get paid early and direct deposits from other stuff comes in quick too. Able to pay my friends and family quickly, I would say the only time I had a bad experience is when someone got my card and cashapp did not refund my money. Used at McDonald‚Äôs over and over and in my foolishness sent the wrong person money on accident. Cash app didn‚Äôt do anything sadly and the person got away with my funds. I have to say in conclusion the app has a lot of features and convenience, but the company lacks the empathy and insurance surrounding your funds. It‚Äôs definitely better to have your main income in the bank and use cashapp secondary. I currently use it primarily but would not recommend it. They offer a cash advance that I was able to get up to couple hundred dollars before pay which is very awesome. That is definitely the big perk about using the app as your main fund source, that and the 2 day early pay. Of course they also have discounts at a bunch of different restaurants and stores when using your card you just have to choose the boost you want. Definitely enjoy using the app and card, the convenience and usability is far from others. Being able to load money from a bunch of places for $1, no atm fees if you deposit a certain amount a month, just a bunch of perks and features.",My Cashapp Experience

I can send money right from my cash app on my phone from my cash app to my family members,my spouse or friends as long as someone has a cash app account or if a person has a bank account linked to their own personal backing account and set up on cash app you can even send or receive from them too you can also get paid sooner from an employer and have your weekly/bi weekly payroll checks directed deposited into you cash app account. Every cash app account gets a personalized Banking Account number & Routing number  to each individual cash app account just give those numbers to your employer for your checks to be direct deposited. Cash app also sends texts alerts to your mobile phone for every purchase made from your cash app card account if you set it up and you can even get email alerts for each purchase, when you send or receive money from your cash app account.

Understanding now, now I know that they meant the amount of money you keep on the actual cash app card itself. The cool thing is, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LINK YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TO YOUR CASH APP CARDüëç. You can link your debit card/s to your cash app card. Meaning, if money somehow happens to get lost/hacked/stolen, it will not be any more than what you put on your card, from your debit or bank(which ever one you decided to connect). You can also manually lock your card!üëç Also from what I have seen, cash app will not allow over withdrawals. Also a good thing. It would not be good to have money automatically taken from your debit/bank account and transferred to your cash app card without knowing(accidentally). It cancels the transaction until youü´µ add the correct amount. Two things I wish cash app would do(maybe it does), is send automatic alerts on upgrading or fixes directly to you without having to look into it.

5,2022-05-29 04:34:08,"I‚Äôve made a purchase a month ago back in April with Cashapp. This was my first and last time using Cashapp. The person who was selling purses was inquiring that I use Cashapp for the payment. I proceeded with the purchase and she accepted the money. I was asking for the tracking number but she never told me it. All she said was that it was shipped and I would receive them in a few days. I kept waiting and asking for the tracking number so I could find out where they where, but she ignored the question and only told me what day I would receive it. It was the day she told me I would receive them but never did. When I messaged her, I said I never received it and then she blocked me. When I reported my refunds twice, both were denied. I received a notification saying ‚ÄúScam Reported: We we‚Äôre unable to recover your money. However, your report will help to prevent future scams, thank you.‚Äù What is with this, I can‚Äôt receive my refund but it‚Äôll help prevent future scams???

3,2023-02-10 18:33:55,"While I appreciate that this app allows for the transfer of money freely between people, bank accounts, debit cards, etc., it‚Äôs very frustrating that every 60-90 days, the auto cash out feature stops working and then I have to go through Plaid to input the user credentials for my linked bank account. Cash app doesn‚Äôt ever acknowledge that the system has glitches. I keep advising Support over and over again that a linked bank account should not delink itself and the Support person or bot becomes confused like I am speaking a different language. I have no idea why it is so difficult for creators and technical support for applications and programs to be honest, transparent, and helpful. A Support person will send a user through the same process that the user completed 3-4 months ago and that was successful at that time and then have the user do the same thing again without admitting or advising that there must be an issue. If you‚Äôre asking me to do the same thing that I did when I set up my account and I haven‚Äôt changed anything, then that means something is wrong. My bank tells me that this isn‚Äôt a problem on its end.

5,2020-10-22 13:00:14,"I really wish that cash app would do better about how refunds are able to be returned to senders, especially when a service has not been completed. They leave up to the recipient on whether or not if they want to return the money or not. Some people are not that honest and will not return money and that is not okay. You have scammers on there who create accounts for non existent businesses that steal people‚Äôs money and it never gets return because the person changes their info and these thieves keep the payments. it‚Äôs not okay. Your good, but it could be better.  Follow up: I recently contacted the recipient about getting the money back on an a service that was not completed and the recipient declined the return transaction. This is after I I was told to reach out to the recipient by Cash App support and like I said, the recipient declined the transaction. I still say, it is not okay to give the recipient  the option to determine whether or not they will give the money back. Some people are not as forth coming and honest. At this point, it‚Äôs not even about the money, it‚Äôs about the principle. I highly doubt that Cash app is unaware that there are dishonest people on here using their app to lie and steal from other Cash app users. That‚Äôs why I said, what is the harm in creating an option for a sender to reverse a payment or something.",Refund issues
5,2020-07-20 06:56:26,I have a huge issue for the first time in four years using Cash App and it has ruined my experience with them. I can‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt care to resolve a fraud issue I encountered that resulted in me losing hundreds of dollars out of my account; I tried explaining to them what happened and they wouldn‚Äôt hear me out. It was absolutely insulting and made me feel helpless. Months later still no resolution and they could care less. Everyone I do peer to peer money transactions with are now being guided to use Venmo or cash. I can‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt care and as a result I will limit my use of their services. I have friends who are blown away at the lack of tact in their customer service and not giving a single care as to what happened even after I explained time and time again that someone (my ex) who had access to my phone and older phone fraudulently used my account and made purchases NOT ME. They see it as the pin was used and the card via my phone was used so I must‚Äôve authorized it which I didn‚Äôt. This is condoning the acts of someone who screwed me over financially during one of the most trying times of my life with this pandemic. As a result I lost the apt I was trying to move into and I am still without a place to live. Cash app and my ex screwed my life up and they don‚Äôt care.

4,2020-09-12 14:29:59,"I absolutely love this app. Money transferring is incredibly easy, and the app overall is incredibly user-friendly. It‚Äôs my personal favorite not only because it‚Äôs easy to use, but I absolutely love the discounts via boosts you can apply to your card. However,Something that‚Äôs hard when it comes down to the boosts is that the majority of the boosts I get are not for things that are local to me. My suggestion would to be pushing out boosts that are more universal. My top two favorite boosts are 10%-15% off any grocery store, and the $1.00 off any coffee shop. The app would get a much higher rating from me if those two options were permanent options that we could choose from. They are more than likely the two most used ones anyway. My only other suggestion for the app would to create an easier and more user-friendly path to customer care via app. If I have an issue it‚Äôs always ‚Äúcontact the merchant‚ÄùAnd that‚Äôs stressful because not every concern that I have is always a refund. So I would‚Äôve given the app a higher rating given that customer care would be easier to get in contact with. My suggestions would be either having a phone number that somebody can call, or an in-app chat for customer care.

However it just won‚Äôt even load up. It keeps crashing before anything loads. My sister has a newer iPhone and it loaded just fine. However, iphones are expensive and I am not about to buy a whole new phone just to fix cash app. Hopefully it works soon.

I‚Äôll come back in the next couple of weeks and see if it has changed cause despite this I really love this app. Just wish it worked on my older phone how it used to. Idk if this is a bug or not.

I accidentally switched the numbers on my birthday, they ended up being backwards and I didn‚Äôt realize until much much later. Whenever I tried to do anything, it would tell me something went wrong, but it would never tell me what.(which is another thing I find quite annoying) I thought it was my name, or maybe my SNN and it took me forever to realize that I put in the wrong birthday while making my account.

I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue with this is disputing actually worked. But I‚Äôve tried it, and it doesn‚Äôt. You get an email and you‚Äôll have to answer some questions.

So now you are out whatever amount that check is. Then when you message customer service they don‚Äôt even read your complaint. They just copy and paste a response but change the reps name on it and don‚Äôt come close to addressing your issue. If it wasn‚Äôt for so many people that I know that only have cashapp I‚Äôd have deleted them a long time ago.

They refused to work with my bank for the dispute and I lost 50$ and the person is still using the app stealing people‚Äôs money. Their customer service is nothing but horrible (at least it was around August so maybe it has changed but my review for some reason won‚Äôt show... let‚Äôs see if this one does...) they depended off TWITTER for customer care which is the most immature and unprofessional way to handle customer service I have ever seen. They refused to elaborate and help me other than the usual responses of ‚Äúit sorry-‚Äú no, fix a problem that happened on your platform that wasn‚Äôt very well taught to the users. Other than that, I liked the app when I had it and if I could trust them slightly I would definitely give it another shot. just the service given to customers has hopefully improved and until I see that my rating will still remain as is.","Lost money, poor service, nice layout, and cool card."
4,2021-03-24 23:54:24,"I Absolutely LOVE this Cash App! There‚Äôs a Bonus I get while using this app too... It monitors the Stock Market & it lets you see how stocks by how they are performing or you can look up individual stocks & keep your own personal list to keep an eye on them! It also tracks the stocks that performed the Best Daily & Best Monthly so even if you‚Äôre not watching those particular stocks you can learn more about them!   The only problem I have is when you go into the app and see you‚Äôve received money from someone and tap on their name... you can send them an emoji to thank them for the cash, but you have to go to a different area of the app to make your deposit into your bank account or bank card... however you have it set up. I honestly hate this part of the app. I think that when you see the person‚Äôs name with an amount sent to you & you tap on it, when you are in that screen you should be able to DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY RIGHT FROM THERE, send a thank you emoji, keep track of your past transactions with that person, etc. without having to maneuver to multiple screens to do each thing.   This is why I have given this app a 4 star, but in reality it‚Äôs a 3.75.

I re-entered (even tho it was entered correctly) my address and waited again after 10 days yet again the app pops off with my address was undeliverable. So I can‚Äôt acted the joke of their customer support to inquire as to WHY my address is undeliverable & was told to delete and reinstall the app. I did that and the requested a new card yet again and after 7 days the app pops off with the SAME ERROR about my address being faulty. So yet again I contacted customer support who tells me that the card take 7-14 days to arrive, which I already knew but the app said my card was could NOT be delivered to my address. Then the support team says they cannot deliver to P.O. Boxes even though o don‚Äôt have a P.O.

1,2019-02-18 19:51:03,So when I first encountered Cashapp I thought it was the way of the future. I could transfer funds easily amongst family members and pay bills. I even had my job direct deposit my check into the account. Then my first hiccup. Seems the system shut down for the weekend and funds could not be used even if they were present. I thought let me find out what‚Äôs going on with the card. So I searched for a number to reach customer service. Found out there isn‚Äôt one. All correspondence is being done through email or text. Okay strange but maybe it was because they are a way of the future. The problem with that future is that text can often be misread or in certain cases the terminology used by email sounds robotic. So I let it pass. Just recently I was out trying to use my card when nothing would go through again. I‚Äôm checking app which is showing me there is a balance but nothing moving. Figured it was a glitch like before and I would wait. I check the app again and now it shows a new bank card number and has informed me(again by email) that my account has been closed. I still have a balance in the account but can‚Äôt retrieve it because 1 the account has been closed without warning 2 I can‚Äôt contact a customer service rep to talk about the situation. Smh. Looked up Sutton bank phone number. Nothing. Square inc phone number. Nothing. Needless to say I‚Äôm done. Moving everything over to Chime where at least I can speak to someone.

They told me it would refunded to the (last 4 digits account) that it came from in 2-5 business day‚Äôs.  After a week the money had not been refunded but, still showed just sitting in my CashApp account.  Once again I messaged support and they once again said it would be returned in 2-5 business days.  When I said that‚Äôs what you told me last time they told me that it was my bank who had not done their part.  I called my bank who then had to walk me through the process of getting my money refunded (cash out, find your bank, and then place it back into your account).  Now it should be back in my account on Tuesday.  When I told support through CashApp this they told me they wanted all correspondences to come from my bank about this transaction.

What happened to just taking $1 first, then taking the rest of the amount later on?

2,2018-08-09 10:39:34,"When I first started using the app, I loved the convenience of it. However, I‚Äôve noticed that nowadays, if I get money sent to me, the amount of time before I can get the money for free - no matter what amount - is days later than it was when I first started using the app. My sister sent me a mere $48 on a Wednesday, and I was given the free option for receiving it on Friday, or in this instance, pay a .78 fee for instant deposit. Even before this particular transaction, there have been other ‚Äòdays later‚Äô options for receiving money or I‚Äôd have to pay the fee to get the money instantly, and it‚Äôs starting to bother me. It just makes no sense. If it was a huge amount, I could understand, but why charge an instant fee for such a small amount? And why not just offer the next business day? I think there should be a required minimum amount of money before charging for instant access, or at least offer the next business day just like other apps do, and not 2 or more days later. Maybe there‚Äôs a rhyme or reason as to how you all decide what amount gets charged a fee or not, or how long before money can be deposited, but I can‚Äôt figure it out. Before using your app, I had been using Zelle and POP Money, but I thought this was better and switched over. Maybe I made a mistake - I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it anymore.

Once I got to looking into Cash App, I noticed they transferred my money from my linked account into Cash App then to bitcoins. They then proceeded to send the bitcoins to themselves.

I have found the email that was used to hack my accounts and the person is from New York. I am now waiting on my bank to dispute these transactions and try to get my money back.

My friend then put in a dispute with the bank, in which, rather than the app doing their due diligence and trying to find out where the funds were sent to, immediately took the money out of my acct again. When I tried to figure out what way going on, where the funds went and how to resolve the situation. I then find out that I cannot talk to someone over the phone for a quick resolution but instead via email. So I send an email notifying them of my complaint and receive a very general email in no way addressing my concerns, but notifying me that because its a bank dispute that have no further details on the issue but that they are typically solve within 90days and that cashapp has the right to withdraw the amount of the disputed transaction.

The money sending process is good up until you type the wrong name and don‚Äôt have an option to retrieve your funds back after noticing your mistake. And let‚Äôs not talk about the customer service or the lack there is. To know that I don‚Äôt have the option to speak with a over the phone but via email, is ridiculous and even with that there is a 24hr wait in response. I just found out that there are several cash app accounts (2) using my name that are not me and people had been sending me money but I haven‚Äôt been getting because of these accounts and customer support said just send a request to the receivers requesting the funds back, and if you have done that and had a good outcome behind it, you are that 1 in a million. I once thought this app was good & deserved 5 stars until my money ended up in the BIG BLACK HOLE/someone else‚Äôs hand and now feel that it really is not worthy of a star.  I now we‚Äôll be deleting my account (if that‚Äôs an option) & using zelle.  A better process needs to be designed for this app. The first being giving the users the option to speak with a person over the phone and not just email; The ability for senders to CANCEL transactions when they noticed a mistake has been made; And a better way to retrieve old accounts.",Frustrated!!! I just want my money back!!!
1,2020-02-23 23:04:42,"Honestly this is more for the customer service than the actual app. I don‚Äôt Believe I‚Äôve ever written a review before, but this was impossible to ignore. When I received my cash app card my last name was missing, well most of it, the first two letters were there. I reached out to see how it could be corrected and was first informed it couldn‚Äôt be. When I asked how I was supposed to use a card without my name on it they explained that since it was a debit card I had to put money on it to use (apparently assuming I didn‚Äôt know how to use it). I replied that since businesses often ask for ID even with debit cards it would useless to which there was no response. A few days later another rep emailed and explained how I could change my name in the app for display on my profile, and finally included details on how to request a corrected card. I responded AND asked if they could confirm my name would fit properly just so I could know if I could include my middle initials on the card. Two days later I got the same email from a NEW rep, with all of the same instructions, and no response to my questions. I replied with the exact same response I had previously, and immediately received a do not reply to this email bounce back.

This is totally ridiculous. I am not someone investing and buying bitcoins and he convinced me that sharing whatever personal amounts of money using bitcoins was the ‚Äúwave of the future.‚Äù Well, I am saying screw this, if just to send some money to someone it takes DAYS and DAYS and already the sign up for this part of your app was already extensive and in depth. Due to the incredibly annoying and also offensive ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù going on, he has coordinated with his bank to send me a CHECK via UPS. Just so you know, I have PayPal, Venmo and Zelle and have frequently used them, including using PayPal invoices for my business. The practice of Cashapp makes me want to never ever use the app. It took 24 hours to get a first response from the people  with Cashapp (other than the ones who help immediately and actually both know nothing and have zero authority to do anything, including get to someone of higher qualifications). Very very disappointing and irritatingly poor business practices. And I do not plan on being quiet about this to those I know..

It comes in handy because I‚Äôm a truck driver and I don‚Äôt have to make plans to make an extra stop and hope western Union is where I‚Äôm stopping. Cash app is easy, fast and was way cheaper than using western Union when I first found it. It‚Äôs made my life a lot less complicated because my landlord even checked out the app a couple of years ago and decided to download it to make rent collections easier. It‚Äôs great to no longer deal with electronic checks or a money order via snail mail or be late paying because I have to come back into town to pay rent. He‚Äôs a bean counter by nature so he likes getting his money with a tap on his phone. I also use it to send birthday money, help the occasional friend in need, etc.  I also load money to pay tolls and sometimes get fast food so that if my card gets jacked (there have been reports of cashiers helping themselves to cash back when people check out), there‚Äôs no direct access to my checking account.

So I email support about it as well as the credit issue, and they email me back this generic response that doesn‚Äôt help me with anything.

Being that the email had the cash app logo, brand, & in the body of the email it had some of my personal info. that I had just entered, as well as the email also had the customers information With his payment info. So at this point I think it‚Äôs all part of the process. Long story short through emails & texts messages I had $600 on hold, so I just needed to add an extra $200 to my cash app account to Increase my daily limit. Mind you there is a plethora of emails, text messages, & information coming directly from the app. I added $200 to the app using the information that was provided to me through these various emails. I quickly realized it was all a ploy to get me to put  $$ on the app because they asked for more shortly after. I saved all of the emails, and text messages, I even saved the confirmation number that was provided to me through the app. To share & let people know, to use any other money app except CASH APP!!!

However RECENTLY there have been so many issues with this. It‚Äôs as if they have a new developer and they completely screwed everything up by trying to continuously add new things in. But they have no idea what they‚Äôre doing. So instead of adding to the app they completely screwed up what didn‚Äôt need to be fixed. With them being an ONLINE only bank they actually have NO ONE available to even speak to. You can‚Äôt chat with anyone of their connection to the app is down, you honestly can NEVER call them for ANY issues. You can‚Äôt even remove your money from the account. I‚Äôve never had this issue before and at this point it‚Äôs tiring and frustrating. They give no warning about anything and you only find out about reoccurring issues if you happen to go online to look for them.

Despite my repeated pleas, they would not contact the people who had called me to tell them I was not responsible for the thefts. Nor will they provide documentation or any written assurances showing me that the poser account had been taken down, or any other information to clear my good name.   They have damaged my reputation and caused me to feel unsafe since the victims were able to find my full name and address online through Spokeo or WhitePages or one of those other services.

Usually have to go back and forth over and over concerning ONE single measly charge. It‚Äôs frankly ridiculous.  There are issues with outages, boosts not applying and then cashapp refusing to honor them, weird double transactions on occasion (granted they fixed that, but it took several days), it‚Äôs kind of chaotic. Considering how large the company has become and how much money gets sent back and forth using their app, you‚Äôd think they would have improved their customer support by now.

When I finally got in touch with a rep, he was difficult to understand and initially seemed rude. When I made comment, he changed his tone and was quite helpful. He had me connect my phone to the computer and we began maneuver through the system. When he had difficulty he got his supervisor who was quite rude and arrogant. He informed me that there was suspicious activity on my account (the month before someone from across the country managed to take money from my account using square, an affiliate of theirs),and I would need to deposit 500 on my cash app and transfer it. I told him I would do no such thing and he then too began raising his voice telling me he was a supervisor. Well I resorted to using expletives, telling him what he could do with that supervisor thing (not proud of that).   As far as I‚Äôm concerned, not only was it annoying speaking to someone I could barely understand, the fact that they had a condescending, oh well attitude.

You want to put some security in place then develop security questions..Again the developer has no need to acquire an SSN or date of birth.  I was really starting to liking this app until the day I was preparing to pay someone a very small amount of money (less than 60 bucks) and before it would process my request it asked for my full SSN & date of birth and I thought why would this app be asking for such info when I‚Äôm using my own debt card from my own account,( I understand about security and so forth but yet I didn‚Äôt have to provide any of this info when I signed up, I may have had to provide my DOB, can‚Äôt recall but I know I didn‚Äôt have to provide my social) there was no need to have this info to process my request.

1,2020-10-06 14:17:55,Initially cash app was easy to use and very convenient. However over time I have become increasingly frustrated with this app. I have it set up as direct deposit. Every once in a while I am hit with a negative balance with no explanation as to how or why. I can never speak to an actual live person. There is never an explanation for the negative balance. Only via email and even then there is no resolution to the problem or an explanation. It generalized automated responses. I‚Äôm confused as to how you are handling people‚Äôs money and don‚Äôt have a phone number when a problem occurs for people to call. I had an issue purchasing some items online granted it was a new site I was purchasing from and I completely understand that for security reason cash app declines or blocks the transaction because they don‚Äôt recognize it but if I am confirming it and saying it is ok then what it the problem? Here is the catch! It says decline but in reality the payment actually went thru and cash app will try to say they money was never removed from your account and if you aren‚Äôt paying attention you will follow their suggestion and use a different form of payment and end up paying twice for the same product with 2 different forms of payment. I need an explanation. I need to know why this app is stealing money. I work very hard and don‚Äôt have any extra coins for cash app to steal!

1,2022-01-01 20:49:29,"I had $4k stolen from both of my debit cards on here and cash app support refused to help me and get to the bottom of how this could have happened.  Someone was adding cash from my debit cards to their cash card somehow.  I have never had a cash card and have no need for one.  This occurred over 52 transactions over 8 months.  Small amounts were generally stolen and it was spread out so I didn‚Äôt notice until it was way to late.  I was buying crypto and stocks and had a death in the family and some other issues so I wasn‚Äôt monitoring this like you obvi need to.  Cash App is not a bank or a credit card and they do not have their customers best interest.  I contacts cash app support and they wanted me to answer 8-10 questions on every fraudulent transaction.  There is no legit phone number either which is very frustrating. My case was passed around to 5-7 people - Alfred, John, Gigi, Sylvie, and finally Marie who sent me an email saying my account was permanently disabled. I feel violated and am very concerned about the lack of concern for my loss of $4k. I‚Äôve had to cancel both debit cards and am sticking to Venmo and PayPal because they are legit and care about their customers who entrust their personal financial info to them. If someone at Cash App could provide me with a name and phone number of someone that can help I would appreciate it but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.",A scam and fraud

I asked for the reason I was banned, he said he didn‚Äôt know. I asked if there was some method of appeal or pursing this so that I could understand why I may have had my account deleted, and he just kept sending me the links to terms of service. I told him that even though I was frustrated, I understood that it wasn‚Äôt his fault, and requested a way to get in contact with legal about petitioning for consumers and clients of cashapp to have access to the reason they were banned. He responded again with the TOS link and then said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go ahead and disconnect the chat.‚Äù I‚Äôve never been so flagrantly blown off by a customer service representative, and it‚Äôs infuriating that they not only didn‚Äôt have to give a reason but wouldn‚Äôt engage in being solution-oriented with me.

However, I recently went to use my card, only to discover that my account had been closed and the money I had had in the app was suddenly no longer available. There is no human being you can contact on the phone for this app. In fact, there is no customer service phone number whatsoever. The only option available is either reading through very unhelpful ‚Äúuser questions‚Äù or sending an email that may or may not ever be returned. When I discovered that I could suddenly no longer use my cash app to send money and that my card was declined (even though I had money in the app), I sent an email to customer service. They responded by saying my account had been closed due to either my transaction history, refund history, or a violation of the user agreement. They refused to give me any details as to why this had suddenly happened in that as far as I knew I had not done anything abnormal or in violation of anything, and that the decision was final. I responded back asking for any information because I felt that this must be an error and never got a single response back. And I have not been able to get my money returned either.

After providing the information, they told me that they then needed for me to apply for a cash card or enable the Bitcoin feature on the new account, so that they could further verify my identity. I enabled the Bitcoin feature, which required me to take a photo of my driver‚Äôs license through the app so that they could verify my identity. After it was verified, I contacted their support team and again, they said that they need more of my personal information, which again, had nothing to do with my account that was set up.

Casey, the support manager, did a wonderful job of changing the name on my account to reflect my new name several months ago, but unfortunately, my former name has continued to appear on all of my monthly statements since then. When I contacted Cash App Support again with a description of the problem and screenshots of two recent statements, I spoke with Danny and Juan, who both completely ignored the problem (telling me that my account already had my new name on it, which I am perfectly aware of) and tried to close the case, without any acknowledgment of the incorrect name on my statements. Furthermore, they labeled the email chain as ‚Äúsuspected spam‚Äù, which tells me that the lack of acknowledgment of the issue was purposeful and not a simple misunderstanding.

Without my knowledge, the transfers I was making to a friend started being sent to SquareCash instead of directly to the bank, the only way to get it to the bank was to ""cash it out"". The app has NO issues when taking your money, but magically cannot ""refund"" any money. Customer support is via email ONLY, so who knows if it's an actual person. I've been trying to find out where a $300 refund is for over a week now and every email response says the EXACT same thing; basically blaming the bank and requesting a letter head note from my bank to prove that I never received the money. After explaining OVER AND OVER again that the bank does not provide such letters nor can they trace the so-called reference number they provided, the email responses still said the exact same thing. My banks branch manager offered to call their customer support (because I am his third customer this week having this issue) but as I mentioned earlier they don't offer phone customer support, cowardly. They provide no proof of it being sent to my account; even the app shows it's not completed.   My bank is now investigating this issue and SquareCash will have to prove to them where this money is.

1,2022-08-26 20:40:16,"I have had an issue with a particular purchase and refund THREE TIMES NOW. I ordered a product in March which I did not receive. After a while I reached out to the merchant who only provided tracking info which did not work so I requested a refund and never heard from them again. I then reached out to cashapp SEVERAL times over the course of about 2 weeks trying to get a refund. They initially credited it back to my account but then again over a month later took it back out after ‚Äúdenying‚Äù my dispute charges. Even when I provided them with substantial proof that I never got my product and reached out to the merchant and was not able to resolve a thing. Finally june 10th I got a refund and an email saying my dispute was refunded and case closed. Then two days ago, OVER TWO MONTHS LATER, they take the money AGAIN. I have now been trying to call (which I was hung up on by a rude cashapp support memeber), emailed, and chatted through the app several times and no one wants to give me any resolutions. They keep just saying they‚Äôre sending it to their specialty department. Why is it so hard to just credit me back the money?

So I transferred money from my bank to the cash app then sent it to my son. It was blocked and denied by cash app. Unknown reason other than it was to protect me. I attempted again only to receive the same outcome. I reached out to cash app support and was told it was stopped for my safety. Ok... I advised that it was a valid transaction and inquired what I need to do in order to verify that for sending. I was told that I could try again later however it would be blocked again. No reason given. When I attempted to question this as again I verified it was a valid sending of funds, I was told that I could use another money sending app. Seriously? Sending me elsewhere instead of sending funds as the app is meant for. Ok... so I created a Venmo. Now comes the fun. When I went to ‚Äúcash out‚Äù and transfer my funds back to my account, I found that I would have to wait three days until I would receive my money or I could do an instant transfer for a $7.50 fee.

So I did, and the vendor customer service representative refused to cancel my subscription. So I called back and spoke with a supervisor who told me that he canceled my subscription and gave me a cancellation number. The very next day I saw another notification that the same vendor was still trying to take $95 out (luckily no funds were there since I never use the card unless I‚Äôm sending money to my children in college). I called the vendor again and again I get another cancellation number (different from the first one). I inquire about the first cancellation number and was told no record of it).

Well when I logged in and noticed I had 0.44 cents left I immediately went and contacted support which has turned out to be the biggest joke of a process I have ever encountered. I was able to speak to a human one time and I got no help what so ever. I was told that I need to dispute each transaction individually and it takes about 7 minutes for each transaction. Well 7 minutes times a couple hundred transactions is absolutely unrealistic. But I started the process anyway. Well after I got through maybe maybe 30 transactions about 3 days later I received 30 emails saying my disputes were denied because they thought I was being fraudulent so therefore I wasted how much time following the this process they created just to turn around and be denied.

Hopefully, they will contact me because this is ridiculous. After doing research, this appears to be a huge issue, and many people are victims, but it seems that Cash App is incapable of protecting clients and won‚Äôt implement protection for clients.

For 3 years Ive used it for simple transactions and sometimes as away to get paid for projects. It has been linked to my debit cards and bank accounts.  Never needed help or customer service before until this past week. All of a sudden all my transactions would receive a ‚Äútransaction failed error message ‚Äú I contacted my banks and both said they had no issues and had not flagged anything for fraud. I contacted cash app and they responded by basically saying that sometimes transactions failed because they saw some use that was out of the ordinary. Folks I‚Äôve never moved more than $300 on this  app. They continued to to tell me that they could give me no further information. When I asked for clarification and relayed my banks info they continued to send me the same canned message. I tried deleting that account and setting up a new one. Same issue. What angers me is that after asking for them to provide records for my account and to substantiate the claim that some ‚Äúout of the ordinary‚Äù transaction took place they simply ignored ‚Äòme. I‚Äôm contacting the CFPB to log a formal complaint in order to get my info. It‚Äôs a great app but if this is how they treat customers who ask questions about things they have right to know then they should be held accountable.,Abysmal customer service

I have never had any kind of issues with cashapp. And when I have had issues with other companies or purchases, CashApp customer service was 100% on my side. CashApp also has a borrow feature now where you can basically get a quick loan if you ever have an emergency or just need some extra cash fast. No hassle or background checks. Quick and easy, I‚Äôm your account in less than one minute! And it will allow you to borrow several hundreds of dollars (depending on how long you have had your account, and how much you keep in it). CashApp also has a savings account! You can do round ups on every purchase and save the change automatically in your savings account! I cannot express enough how easy/simple this app is! And I used it heavily for EVERYTHING! I never have to touch real money anymore since using CashApp. Oh, and unlimited atm withdraws from select atms (they have a map to show you where to go). Again, I like this app for all my banking needs. It‚Äôs easy to use, and has so many perks!

I get paid early and direct deposits from other stuff comes in quick too. Able to pay my friends and family quickly, I would say the only time I had a bad experience is when someone got my card and cashapp did not refund my money. Used at McDonald‚Äôs over and over and in my foolishness sent the wrong person money on accident. Cash app didn‚Äôt do anything sadly and the person got away with my funds. I have to say in conclusion the app has a lot of features and convenience, but the company lacks the empathy and insurance surrounding your funds. It‚Äôs definitely better to have your main income in the bank and use cashapp secondary. I currently use it primarily but would not recommend it. They offer a cash advance that I was able to get up to couple hundred dollars before pay which is very awesome. That is definitely the big perk about using the app as your main fund source, that and the 2 day early pay. Of course they also have discounts at a bunch of different restaurants and stores when using your card you just have to choose the boost you want.

Follow up: I recently contacted the recipient about getting the money back on an a service that was not completed and the recipient declined the return transaction. This is after I I was told to reach out to the recipient by Cash App support and like I said, the recipient declined the transaction. I still say, it is not okay to give the recipient  the option to determine whether or not they will give the money back. Some people are not as forth coming and honest. At this point, it‚Äôs not even about the money, it‚Äôs about the principle. I highly doubt that Cash app is unaware that there are dishonest people on here using their app to lie and steal from other Cash app users. That‚Äôs why I said, what is the harm in creating an option for a sender to reverse a payment or something.",Refund issues
5,2020-07-20 06:56:26,I have a huge issue for the first time in four years using Cash App and it has ruined my experience with them. I can‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt care to resolve a fraud issue I encountered that resulted in me losing hundreds of dollars out of my account; I tried explaining to them what happened and they wouldn‚Äôt hear me out. It was absolutely insulting and made me feel helpless. Months later still no resolution and they could care less. Everyone I do peer to peer money transactions with are now being guided to use Venmo or cash. I can‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt care and as a result I will limit my use of their services. I have friends who are blown away at the lack of tact in their customer service and not giving a single care as to what happened even after I explained time and time again that someone (my ex) who had access to my phone and older phone fraudulently used my account and made purchases NOT ME. They see it as the pin was used and the card via my phone was used so I must‚Äôve authorized it which I didn‚Äôt. This is condoning the acts of someone who screwed me over financially during one of the most trying times of my life with this pandemic. As a result I lost the apt I was trying to move into and I am still without a place to live. Cash app and my ex screwed my life up and they don‚Äôt care. This is madness,Cash App customer service is a joke
4,2020-09-12 14:29:59,"I absolutely love this app. Money transferring is incredibly easy, and the app overall is incredibly user-friendly. It‚Äôs my personal favorite not only because it‚Äôs easy to use, but I absolutely love the discounts via boosts you can apply to your card. However,Something that‚Äôs hard when it comes down to the boosts is that the majority of the boosts I get are not for things that are local to me. My suggestion would to be pushing out boosts that are more universal. My top two favorite boosts are 10%-15% off any grocery store, and the $1.00 off any coffee shop. The app would get a much higher rating from me if those two options were permanent options that we could choose from. They are more than likely the two most used ones anyway. My only other suggestion for the app would to create an easier and more user-friendly path to customer care via app. If I have an issue it‚Äôs always ‚Äúcontact the merchant‚ÄùAnd that‚Äôs stressful because not every concern that I have is always a refund. So I would‚Äôve given the app a higher rating given that customer care would be easier to get in contact with. My suggestions would be either having a phone number that somebody can call, or an in-app chat for customer care. Overall I really love the app. It‚Äôs save me a lot of money, and I highly recommend it overall to most people. It‚Äôs my preferred method to handle my money.",Love it... but....
4,2021-12-08 16:20:44,"Normally I‚Äôd give cash app 4.5 stars its a great app. But ever since December started it has been crashing. Granted I have an older IPhone, but its weird because I‚Äôve never had these issues before. I am concerned bc this app is easy when it comes to giving and receiving funds. However it just won‚Äôt even load up. It keeps crashing before anything loads. My sister has a newer iPhone and it loaded just fine. However, iphones are expensive and I am not about to buy a whole new phone just to fix cash app. Hopefully it works soon. Cause most people have cash app and I am willing to use other avenues, but most people only have cash app. This is kind of frustrating but I will keep checking in the next few weeks. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I even called support and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôll get back. I‚Äôll come back in the next couple of weeks and see if it has changed cause despite this I really love this app. Just wish it worked on my older phone how it used to. Idk if this is a bug or not.  UPDATE: customer service called the same day I requested it. They were very nice and now cash app is loading up for me. If you are having the same issues and have an older iPhone. That is probably it, but don‚Äôt worry. No need to buy a new phone just call cash app and they will help you! Updated rating is back to 4.",KEEPS Crashing

Well, that kept failing and declining. Now, it‚Äôs the next morning, my debit card is fine now but still unable to add cash to my cashapp card. Deleted the card and decided to readd it, only to be told 3 times it was incorrect number even THOUGH i‚Äôm staring at my card right next to me as I‚Äôm typing the numbers in; nothing is wrong.

And the theft still out there doing his same old job stealing people money. I mean this Cashapp didn‚Äôt have a security or protection for their customers at all. All the answer I got just try to run away from me or something.   Remember if y‚Äôall love cash app and in the future have some problem  just like me please don‚Äôt bother to ask for their help. Cause if you do all you got just frustrated and can‚Äôt do nothing about it. Sit back relax and wait for those answer just pop up as much as different agent come and leave the same message and disappear just like nothing happen. I never seen any kind of customer service like this before. Yotta even they couldn‚Äôt help you return a full amount of your lost but they are deeply try to help you until the problem will be solve and return to you haft of the lost. But this one doesn‚Äôt.

I accidentally switched the numbers on my birthday, they ended up being backwards and I didn‚Äôt realize until much much later. Whenever I tried to do anything, it would tell me something went wrong, but it would never tell me what.(which is another thing I find quite annoying) I thought it was my name, or maybe my SNN and it took me forever to realize that I put in the wrong birthday while making my account.  I thought I could go to support to get it fixed but nope. They can‚Äôt even change it, not even with id or anything like that to prove that it‚Äôs you and that you made a mistake. Copy and pasted responses it feels like.       Literally all I need to do is change my birthday and I‚Äôll be able to use the app, but since they don‚Äôt offer that, I‚Äôm stuck with an account that I can‚Äôt use, I can‚Äôt make anymore accounts cause I‚Äôd have to use this phone number, but I can‚Äôt close my account cause I have money on it, and I need to identify that it‚Äôs me, but since the birthday is wrong I‚Äôm pretty sure that won‚Äôt work.

And yet my information gets stolen which is annoying. But what makes it worse is that when someone makes an unauthorized transaction and you try to dispute it, you have to wait for the transaction to be finished, and you cannot cancel it but instead have to dispute it. I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue with this is disputing actually worked. But I‚Äôve tried it, and it doesn‚Äôt. You get an email and you‚Äôll have to answer some questions. If they deem your answers invalid they won‚Äôt give you your money back, which I wouldn‚Äôt be frustrated at if they actually judged it well. For example, I live in Massachusetts and don‚Äôt ever make transactions outside of Massachusetts (never have), why would my next transaction be in a whole other state when I just now made a transaction here unless there were multiple users on the card? Disputed transactions, from my experience and my research, rarely go the way they should, and in order to fix that it would be better if the team used some understanding of their customers.",If your information gets stolen you‚Äôre basically screwed
5,2021-02-09 17:52:56,Don‚Äôt use them and especially that mobile feature. They make you write for ‚Äúmobile deposit‚Äù on the check but then will still deny it so then when you have to take to a bank they won‚Äôt cash it for you cause they think you already mobile deposited it when they denied you. So now you are out whatever amount that check is. Then when you message customer service they don‚Äôt even read your complaint. They just copy and paste a response but change the reps name on it and don‚Äôt come close to addressing your issue. If it wasn‚Äôt for so many people that I know that only have cashapp I‚Äôd have deleted them a long time ago. You get no help from customer service and they close your disputes without it being resolved so you have to constantly start over with someone new on each email. You don‚Äôt have just one person helping. It‚Äôs someone new every time and they have no clue but copy and paste some response that has nothing to do on ur issue. So don‚Äôt if you have a choice or maybe someone will read this that makes sense. I‚Äôve edited this paragraph three times or added onto it and still no one from this company has contacted me.

1,2021-02-26 20:45:01,"Pros: very easy to use, navigate, and the card is super cool. Only thing I miss is the card. Deals upon deals if you sign up to get the card and it was always convenient to get 5$ off bills occasionally lol. Cons: this happened about a year ago but I was trying to pay for something when I thought the person had a business account and they stole my money. Cash app kept saying they don‚Äôt do business but yet the button to change an account to business is right there..... so maybe back then they should of educated us more rather than expecting us to know. They refused to work with my bank for the dispute and I lost 50$ and the person is still using the app stealing people‚Äôs money. Their customer service is nothing but horrible (at least it was around August so maybe it has changed but my review for some reason won‚Äôt show... let‚Äôs see if this one does...) they depended off TWITTER for customer care which is the most immature and unprofessional way to handle customer service I have ever seen. They refused to elaborate and help me other than the usual responses of ‚Äúit sorry-‚Äú no, fix a problem that happened on your platform that wasn‚Äôt very well taught to the users. Other than that, I liked the app when I had it and if I could trust them slightly I would definitely give it another shot. just the service given to customers has hopefully improved and until I see that my rating will still remain as is.","Lost money, poor service, nice layout, and cool card."

It monitors the Stock Market & it lets you see how stocks by how they are performing or you can look up individual stocks & keep your own personal list to keep an eye on them! It also tracks the stocks that performed the Best Daily & Best Monthly so even if you‚Äôre not watching those particular stocks you can learn more about them!   The only problem I have is when you go into the app and see you‚Äôve received money from someone and tap on their name... you can send them an emoji to thank them for the cash, but you have to go to a different area of the app to make your deposit into your bank account or bank card... however you have it set up. I honestly hate this part of the app. I think that when you see the person‚Äôs name with an amount sent to you & you tap on it, when you are in that screen you should be able to DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY RIGHT FROM THERE, send a thank you emoji, keep track of your past transactions with that person, etc. without having to maneuver to multiple screens to do each thing.

I re-entered (even tho it was entered correctly) my address and waited again after 10 days yet again the app pops off with my address was undeliverable. So I can‚Äôt acted the joke of their customer support to inquire as to WHY my address is undeliverable & was told to delete and reinstall the app. I did that and the requested a new card yet again and after 7 days the app pops off with the SAME ERROR about my address being faulty. So yet again I contacted customer support who tells me that the card take 7-14 days to arrive, which I already knew but the app said my card was could NOT be delivered to my address.

1,2019-02-18 19:51:03,So when I first encountered Cashapp I thought it was the way of the future. I could transfer funds easily amongst family members and pay bills. I even had my job direct deposit my check into the account. Then my first hiccup. Seems the system shut down for the weekend and funds could not be used even if they were present. I thought let me find out what‚Äôs going on with the card. So I searched for a number to reach customer service. Found out there isn‚Äôt one. All correspondence is being done through email or text. Okay strange but maybe it was because they are a way of the future. The problem with that future is that text can often be misread or in certain cases the terminology used by email sounds robotic. So I let it pass. Just recently I was out trying to use my card when nothing would go through again. I‚Äôm checking app which is showing me there is a balance but nothing moving. Figured it was a glitch like before and I would wait. I check the app again and now it shows a new bank card number and has informed me(again by email) that my account has been closed. I still have a balance in the account but can‚Äôt retrieve it because 1 the account has been closed without warning 2 I can‚Äôt contact a customer service rep to talk about the situation. Smh. Looked up Sutton bank phone number. Nothing. Square inc phone number. Nothing. Needless to say I‚Äôm done. Moving everything over to Chime where at least I can speak to someone.

2,2018-08-09 10:39:34,"When I first started using the app, I loved the convenience of it. However, I‚Äôve noticed that nowadays, if I get money sent to me, the amount of time before I can get the money for free - no matter what amount - is days later than it was when I first started using the app. My sister sent me a mere $48 on a Wednesday, and I was given the free option for receiving it on Friday, or in this instance, pay a .78 fee for instant deposit. Even before this particular transaction, there have been other ‚Äòdays later‚Äô options for receiving money or I‚Äôd have to pay the fee to get the money instantly, and it‚Äôs starting to bother me. It just makes no sense. If it was a huge amount, I could understand, but why charge an instant fee for such a small amount? And why not just offer the next business day? I think there should be a required minimum amount of money before charging for instant access, or at least offer the next business day just like other apps do, and not 2 or more days later. Maybe there‚Äôs a rhyme or reason as to how you all decide what amount gets charged a fee or not, or how long before money can be deposited, but I can‚Äôt figure it out. Before using your app, I had been using Zelle and POP Money, but I thought this was better and switched over. Maybe I made a mistake - I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it anymore.

My friend then put in a dispute with the bank, in which, rather than the app doing their due diligence and trying to find out where the funds were sent to, immediately took the money out of my acct again. When I tried to figure out what way going on, where the funds went and how to resolve the situation. I then find out that I cannot talk to someone over the phone for a quick resolution but instead via email. So I send an email notifying them of my complaint and receive a very general email in no way addressing my concerns, but notifying me that because its a bank dispute that have no further details on the issue but that they are typically solve within 90days and that cashapp has the right to withdraw the amount of the disputed transaction.

Thank you so much cash app team !!!! You‚Äôve outdone yourself with this one. Oh and one more thing I also like how our borrow balance starts off low but in due time and after we‚Äôve paid back the money on time our borrow balance starts to rise; saves you guys a lot of time to differentiate between the people in this world.",Borrowing instantly

I would give it a corner of a star if I could. In every comment it‚Äôs the same and it‚Äôs true the customer service is horrible, money goes missing, they don‚Äôt answer you when you email them back or anything. When I first started using it everything was fine my first problem was when someone sent me $40 and it never came through my acct at all it showed in my transactions in the other persons transactions but never hit my back acct so I removed my bank card and stopped using the app. Then when I downloaded it and used it again I was literally going to place like the gas station and McDonalds then all of a sudden nothing is going through. Money can‚Äôt be sent received nothing and when I contact them they basically accuse me of fraud and say they shut down my acct won‚Äôt give me a reason why and won‚Äôt let me get my funds I had left off the acct. I have worked in customer service just about all my life and this........THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER BEEN DEALT. I would rather walk in a store and stare at the cashier for 5 mins waiting for them to notice I‚Äôm there while they txt their boyfriend back than to deal with these people over email!!!

1,2018-07-20 06:27:04,"I hate this app. Honestly just download venmo, it‚Äôs much easier. To be honest, I only downloaded it for the $5 reward but that didn‚Äôt even work out. My friend and I sent money to each other so they would give me the reward. It had no trouble taking the money out of my checking account (since my cashapp balance was zero, having never used it) and it says that I got the reward. But it says my balance is only $5. This doesn‚Äôt add up since I‚Äôm -5 in my checking and +5 on the app. It should be +10 if it really rewarded me. I‚Äôm trying not to be frustrated over $5 but it‚Äôs so difficult to transfer to my bank account, so if anyone wants to give me cash I‚Äôll transfer the $5 to your cashapp so I can delete mine and be done with it. Basically took $5 from my account since I can‚Äôt actually use the money on my app unless I want to pay someone through it, which I don‚Äôt since almost all my friends use venmo (for good reason).   In response to the developer commenting on my review, I did do it through the link that my friend sent and followed ALL of the steps. The app even says in my notifications that both my friend and cashapp supposedly paid me, but one or the other is missing from my bank account. I did not miss a step. The fact that they acknowledged my review but didn‚Äôt acknowledge or try to figure out what happened on my account also goes to show that this app clearly doesn‚Äôt care about its consumers and would rather just put the blame on them.

1,2020-12-04 17:38:42,The app is good but it doesn‚Äôt make up for the lack of customer service. I was a victim of a phishing attempt that resulted in my account being hacked. I changed my info as they suggest and contacted them. They simply sent me a computer generated message on how to change my pin which I already did. Fast forward a couple weeks and I get notifications of somebody else logging into my cash app. I opened my app and removed my personal bank info in an attempt to protect its security. While I was on the app I literally watched helplessly while the other person sold all the money I had in stocks. They then requested the money from another cash app account and approved it while logged into my account. So I once again contacted cash support. I almost thought I got somewhere when they told me they‚Äôd open an investigation and asked for more info. I gave them everything they needed and was told if I had any questions feel free to reach out. I continued to ask questions because I was concerned with the security of my accounts and if my money could be returned. I never heard any response from them from there out. I even attempted to reach out to them again in hopes to maybe get them to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù it all again. I literally got almost the exact same messages all leading up to no response or any real help at all.

However, I suddenly receive a message one day while attempting to receive money, that said my account was closed for that very reason. After contacting customer support, they were unable to give me any details whatsoever regarding why this happened or what was supposedly done by any of us to violate their terms and they refused to reinstate my account. They offered me the option to have someone contact me through email to try to resolve the issue, however it is months later and I have still never received any contact from anyone at Cashapp. I tried to make a new account with an alternate email address and it allowed me to, only to immediate close my account again as soon as I tried to use it.

Later that very night 3hrs later the funds were disbursed to that person and the product I was trying to pay for I didn‚Äôt have and the individual have position of my funds and went ghost on me and I don‚Äôt have the goods I was trying to purchase.

When I asked how I was supposed to use a card without my name on it they explained that since it was a debit card I had to put money on it to use (apparently assuming I didn‚Äôt know how to use it). I replied that since businesses often ask for ID even with debit cards it would useless to which there was no response. A few days later another rep emailed and explained how I could change my name in the app for display on my profile, and finally included details on how to request a corrected card. I responded AND asked if they could confirm my name would fit properly just so I could know if I could include my middle initials on the card.

He‚Äôs a bean counter by nature so he likes getting his money with a tap on his phone.

He informed me that there was suspicious activity on my account (the month before someone from across the country managed to take money from my account using square, an affiliate of theirs),and I would need to deposit 500 on my cash app and transfer it. I told him I would do no such thing and he then too began raising his voice telling me he was a supervisor. Well I resorted to using expletives, telling him what he could do with that supervisor thing (not proud of that).   As far as I‚Äôm concerned, not only was it annoying speaking to someone I could barely understand, the fact that they had a condescending, oh well attitude. It‚Äôs unfortunate because I enjoyed the convenience of cash app. However the customer service in the event of issues are horrible. I deleted the app and will just go back to my original manner of transferring money!!",Horrible Customer Service
3,2018-02-06 14:53:21,"Ok, so the response I received from the developer is a bunch of crap... I‚Äôve made higher payments through the CASH APP and it never asked me for my personal info. This app has no reason to request an individual‚Äôs SSN or date of birth, especially with the high rate of identity theft in the world. You want to put some security in place then develop security questions..Again the developer has no need to acquire an SSN or date of birth.  I was really starting to liking this app until the day I was preparing to pay someone a very small amount of money (less than 60 bucks) and before it would process my request it asked for my full SSN & date of birth and I thought why would this app be asking for such info when I‚Äôm using my own debt card from my own account,( I understand about security and so forth but yet I didn‚Äôt have to provide any of this info when I signed up, I may have had to provide my DOB, can‚Äôt recall but I know I didn‚Äôt have to provide my social) there was no need to have this info to process my request. So I sent an email to the developer and was advised to send them info they should already have, at this point it appeared that something fraudulent was going on so I immediately deleted this app, don‚Äôt have any plans to reuse. All I can say for future users be careful, don‚Äôt give out your SSN.",Short lived

As I am scheduled an eviction, it would be really nice to know what Cash App has done with my money, but being that you do not have a customer service line where I can talk to a real person, I am scared I would have to take legal action. I am highly uncomfortable knowing that my money isn‚Äôt in my account where it was scheduled to be deposited and it has completely unconvinced my life and my three children‚Äôs lives as we use this money to eat, pay bills, buy gas, pay out car insurance and rent, and I have no clue when I will get it. Cash app has completely  no way to get up with a live person right now. How many people would like for their money to be in cyber space somewhere while pending eviction from the home your family lives in? üíî Cash app has let me down.

If anyone gets you debt card info along with your email and phone number, they can get funds out of you account via Cash App.  I had an old account and closed it a few years ago. My adult (troubled) child got my debt card info and cash app‚Äôed herself -which went through.  This has occurred several times-I know-forgetting my purse was accessible etc. That‚Äôs on me.  However, no one seems to be able to put a stop on the Cash App transaction that was not okayed by me,( not the bank, and not Cash App-very unhelpful customer service) when I don‚Äôt even have an active account.  I don‚Äôt understand the lack of accountability for that.     I am not asking for reimbursement, I am just asking for a safety stop/ mechanism to prevent this craziness.  I can only guess this is happening to others as it seems very easy to do.  So before you download this App-consider a more regulated, safer way to transfer funds-Like Zelle.  I have not experienced any fraudulent activity with that form of money transfer.  And another note, please Cash App- keep the customer service representatives work here in the USA. I could barely understand the customer service representative on the phone not due to low volume, but due to a strong Indian accent.  So cash App owners/administrators-DO BETTER!",BEWARE! USE ZELLE for money transfers.

I asked my girlfriend to download the app to send me $50 that she needed to give me. When she sent it, it went to my cash drawer. Easy enough. Then I went to cash out and it told me that it was ""instantly deposited"" into my bank account. At first, I was like no way. So I went to check my bank and there it was, $50 dollar deposit transaction and ready to use. I would recommend this app to all my college friends because it's really useful for us since none of us ever carry around cash. I do admit that I don't believe I ever received the $5 for referring a friend but I don't really care about the promo money.  Update: It's been a year since I've used the app. My girlfriend sent me over $600 last month with the app and I was debating whether to keep it in the app since I have that beautiful etched Cash black card now or not but in the end, I decided to put it in my bank account.

I explained my situation to the person over the phone. They assumed that i was trying to reopen my accounts with them. I tried to tell them no and further explain to them what i needed, but instead of letting me speak they decided to cut me off and have an attitude with me.

2,2022-11-12 15:29:53,"The fact that cash app takes $2.50 out of your money as if the ATM doesn‚Äôt already take cash out of your money is very disrespectful. Say a person only has $10 on their card, cash app will take $2.50 of that and an ATM will take about $3.75 what is left to take out? That is $6.25 of your last $10. Which leaves you $3.75 and you tell me which ATM will let you take out $3.75 and on top of that what can you buy with that? I‚Äôm sure without the $2.50 charge you would not be able to get much with the $6.25 change left but I am just speaking on principles. So let‚Äôs say the ATM is free and you have $10 and you truly need your $10 that $2.50 charge makes it impossible for you to withdraw any cash whatsoever if you only have $10 in your account. You may have needed that last $10 for gas or a little bit of groceries or just something else but cash app was just that greedy that they took that amount from you. And that goes for amounts that are higher as well. I‚Äôm thinking about closing down my cash app because first it was $2 and now it‚Äôs gone up to $2.50, what‚Äôs next $3.00?

I pulled out the cash app card and was completely satisfied with how everything seemed to work good for the most part. My only issue was I paid two deposits to two different hotels and I never received my money back for those. I contacted cash app support and they weren‚Äôt any help.

This seems odd as they have used the app to receive cash in the past with no problem and the two payments which I sent are well under the $250 trip point that I‚Äôve read can often trigger a verification request.  She‚Äôs not comfortable putting this info in and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be rhyme or reason for why it happened. And what a drag of it happens again and again?

Highly recommend using another app that has some security and has a decent customer service. Definitely going to place a complaint with the BBB.

Every once in a while I am hit with a negative balance with no explanation as to how or why. I can never speak to an actual live person. There is never an explanation for the negative balance. Only via email and even then there is no resolution to the problem or an explanation. It generalized automated responses. I‚Äôm confused as to how you are handling people‚Äôs money and don‚Äôt have a phone number when a problem occurs for people to call. I had an issue purchasing some items online granted it was a new site I was purchasing from and I completely understand that for security reason cash app declines or blocks the transaction because they don‚Äôt recognize it but if I am confirming it and saying it is ok then what it the problem? Here is the catch! It says decline but in reality the payment actually went thru and cash app will try to say they money was never removed from your account and if you aren‚Äôt paying attention you will follow their suggestion and use a different form of payment and end up paying twice for the same product with 2 different forms of payment.

I was buying crypto and stocks and had a death in the family and some other issues so I wasn‚Äôt monitoring this like you obvi need to.  Cash App is not a bank or a credit card and they do not have their customers best interest.  I contacts cash app support and they wanted me to answer 8-10 questions on every fraudulent transaction.

I've been trying to find out where a $300 refund is for over a week now and every email response says the EXACT same thing; basically blaming the bank and requesting a letter head note from my bank to prove that I never received the money. After explaining OVER AND OVER again that the bank does not provide such letters nor can they trace the so-called reference number they provided, the email responses still said the exact same thing. My banks branch manager offered to call their customer support (because I am his third customer this week having this issue) but as I mentioned earlier they don't offer phone customer support, cowardly. They provide no proof of it being sent to my account; even the app shows it's not completed.   My bank is now investigating this issue and SquareCash will have to prove to them where this money is.   If you like losing money, I recommend using this app.... otherwise there are MANY other ways to send and receive money. Good riddance Cashapp",DO NOT USE!!!!
1,2020-12-22 22:02:00,I am very disappointed in the app because l got scammed without me even knowing it. So l made a payment to a person and after l made that payment they somehow got into my account and made unauthorized transactions/payments that were deducted from my credit card and l contacted my bank and they told me that ‚Äúit was you the one who made the payment ‚Äú and l had no idea why they said that and the thing that makes me more mad is that l requested a refund and it says pending and it‚Äôs just there doing nothing. I want and demand cash app to also have a form of contacting the recipient(other person doing the payment to) via their phone and/or email even if they delete or close their account. And l also wanted to see the receipt of my unauthorized transaction and nothing appears it says ‚Äú an unknown error has occurred and it underneath that it says ‚ÄúThe cash app team has been notified‚Äù and after that it‚Äôs nothing. They made two unauthorized transactions of $400 and 402 just before when l had finish sending the 50 dollars which that was an authorized payment and the other two weren‚Äôt. I also hate that people refuse to refund you your payment. Please fix this cash app. Many people are at risk of getting scammed and there needs to be more strict ways of having a cash app although it‚Äôs easy to send money back and forth.,I am going insane and I am very mad

Purchasing the bitcoin was simple it allowed me to do so in a few steps. Sending it to the recipient however required verification which is fine - if the verification ID scanner actually worked or the customer service actually responded. It didn‚Äôt so I immediately contacted support sending them my ID photos for them to confirm my identity. They didn‚Äôt do this, they simply sent me instructions of how to make the scanner work - very condescending as if I‚Äôd not used my camera before. I then sent another support email and they said it would take 10 days for them to verify manually. This is a banking app - response times should be at most 24 hours not a matter of days. The value of my bitcoin then dropped below the amount of the goods I wanted to purchase. Yet to be sorted by customer service and they haven‚Äôt offered to give me the money back - what‚Äôs the point of advertising a bitcoin payment service if you don‚Äôt verify people on the day? I wasn‚Äôt in it for the investment.

1,2020-04-12 04:12:10,"Just to clarify I have been a user of the cash app since 2015. However, about a month ago my car was broken into, the criminal stole about $3,000 worth of my stuff including my phone and wallet. When I started getting texts from one of my banks on my secondary phone asking if I was getting gas and ordering breakfast at jack in the box, I replied no and the card was locked. I immediately ran to my car and saw the door to my convertible was open. I drove over to the closest JiTB and they said they remember the people but didn‚Äôt have a camera on the drive thru. I received texts throughout the day from cash app stating they were using my card in cities nearby so I followed them and finally found them. I reported the break in to the police and cash app with the evidence I compiled in order to get most (not all) of my stuff back. They spent about $700 of my cash app money and when I gave cash app support EVERYTHING I had on the criminals they denied that an error occurred and DID NOT refund me any money that they used. I requested the claim be reopened 3 times and all 3 times they denied an error occurred.   My situation was handled the best I could handle it given my military background and I would advise EVERYONE that using the cash app as a bank is ILL-ADVISED.

Using this app now, I keep like literally only $15 dollars, I do not keep my bank linked either any more money that gets put into it is only put in if I need to use the app to pay someone back or something similar. I always have my card locked when not in use and any security function possible. Because it is very easily to get scammed and most of the time the support will just straight up ghost you. And that is like the worst thing for a MONEY company to do. I‚Äôve heard countless stories of people loosing everything even in their linked bank as well and not getting support at all, for your safety, please do not trust this app. I‚Äôd recommend to use something else like especially one that‚Äôs connected to your banking service so it is easier to get support.

I checked and it had not been refunded I email back and they said that they can do nothing about it and pull a statement saying I had $19 in my account when i went to get gas thus the insufficient funds. They have a statement, and all I have is a -$100 in my app. I have no way to show them that I had $108. I wouldn‚Äôt of used the cash app card if I only had $19 for gas. Customer service is kind but very slow and very quick to say they can do nothing about it but they stolen my $100 or the balance you see in the app in inaccurate. This has been a terrible inconvenience and a horrible experience using cash app. Would reconsider if the were willing to fix and address this issue.",Stolen/ lost money.
5,2023-01-03 22:51:10,I‚Äôve used Cash App for  a few years without any problem. That is until today!  Friend sent me 50$ that he owed me using cash app to pay me back. I was totally fine with this since I have never had an issue with cash app in the past. He sent the $50 and on his end it showed that he had sent $50. Yet on my end I only received $30. With no explanation why.  II am not any kind of computer genius but the app is simple to use and this is beyond me why is it my money here.? I contacted customer support over and over and over and over again and waited and waited and waited and waited wrote them my complaint over and over and over again and got zero reply I am very very upset with us! This is supposed to be a professional business I am a paying customer yet I am not being taken care of I want my money I need my money I want to be compensated for you shorting me on the payment I am entitled to. Get back to me as soon as possible you have my email address you have my phone number you have everything I am so upset.,It isn‚Äôt giving me the amount people are sending  me!
1,2021-03-04 02:05:11,This app is a scam..i am a barber so I got the app to get payment from my customers I‚Äôve already had 400 dollars stolen from my account reported it to cash app nothing nothing was done just kept giving me the run around never received my money or explanation as to what happened to it. There is no real actual number that you can call to talk to someone that have you send out messages just to sit and wait and hope someone get back with you. Now I have multiple accounts linked to 1 email account and when I log in I don‚Äôt have the option to pick what account to open I have money on to different accounts but can‚Äôt access neither one of them. Cash is a scam I am out of hundreds of dollars and this app have become an inconvenience to me. Before you get cash app I suggest you do your research and find something that actually have a customer support number because all the emails with no response is ridiculous the answer are computer generated I thought it was a cool app when I first got it but once you start losing money then have no way of actually talking to someone about the issue make you feel completely stupid and vulnerable I honestly would not recommend this app to anyone if money gets messed for some reason just count it as a loss I can imagine how many other have this problem and how much money that have made,Can‚Äôt access my account

They have no customer phone support even though they have a customer service phone number that only redirects you to use their app. I emailed customer support and I received a response but the response simply reiterated the request for the refund in gift cards before I‚Äôd receive my money. Not only that, but their response was so poorly worded and misspelled that it appeared a small child wrote the response.   If you want users to feel confident using this app, then you should have better customer support. Especially considering I am a first time user, this entire ordeal has not inspired me to continue using the app given how absurdly difficult it has been to actually be paid for something I‚Äôve already shipped.   Additionally, there is nothing saying you have to have a business account versus a personal account in order to receive payments over $500 when you begin using the app. If this does occur, then the app requires the payer to add an additional $500 to expand your account. After that, they request the money to be refunded through gift cards when you still have not received any sort of payment for the item you‚Äôve sold. Needless to say, this business practice seems suspicious at best to me.",User Beware

Apple told me that they not the one charging my account the amount of $365 and that they not charge my account at all for anything and send me my whole Apple statement summary to prove it. Apple even offer to speak with them on a three way with to clear up an misunderstood that they‚Äôre having. So I contacted Cash app through email and information them of what Apple said and send the my Apple statement and inform they about the offer of the three way conversation. Still Cash app want to charge me a fraudulent transaction charge. The thing about it is that they‚Äôre charging my account a Whole $365 but I can‚Äôt find on my Cash Apple statement as to where what the charge are for, it not even on my Cash app Statement.

I looked it up online, and I read that many people have the same issue, however the scan usually works on Samsung phones. So I logged into my account on a Samsung phone and the scan worked fine (still should be able to work on an iPhone though. It‚Äôs not a hardware issue, my camera works just fine, and I do scans on other apps just fine). Then when the app asked for my address, it said my address was not valid. I decided to switch back to my iPhone at this point and when I entered the SAME EXACT address, it worked (again, this should work on BOTH types of phones, not just one of them). You guys need to seriously fix how unintuitive and faulty your app is on both Samsung and Apple phones. I should not have to switch between two different phones every time I have to log in or make a transaction.

I contacted Cash Support and within 5 minutes I received an email informing me that they were closing my account without eligibility to reopen it.

I was sent a cashapp request from one of my good friends asking to borrow money, this is something we have done in the past and has never been a problem. I sent her $100 and was immediately sent another request for another $150, but this time it said ‚ÄúPlease in danger ill nust give 400‚Äù now the red flags raise up and I call her immediately. She tells me to not send anything to those request it‚Äôs not her and that she has been hacked and multiple people in her contacts have all sent money to these people. Needless to say I was angry and out of $100. Looking at the first request there was nothing suspicious or anything about it, they used some of her verbiage from the last time she borrowed money from me and just resent it. Her profile picture everything except they added a 1 to the end of her profile name. Unfortunately as we all know there is now CashApp customer service line so I‚Äôm just stomped on how these people could do this and get away. I am super hesitant to use this app again and am thinking of just getting rid of it all together, I would hate to have this happen again.

Once contacted via email, they are short with no type of urgency to help assist the customer resolve the issue.

I withdrew money from an Atm(my unemployment benefits to be exact) the money was not dispensed from the machine it said error. Usually when using any other company the money is return to your card because no money was taken when this sort of thing happens. Cash app was provided with receipts proving i received no money from the transactions. They refunded me $2 and the atm fee from a 100$ atm withdrawal from which till this day the money has not been returned. I have spoken to numerous agents and gotten the run around for almost a month straight. One agent says my money will be return in 7 to 10 business not its 45 calendar days after recording written copy from them that they would provide me with a provisional credit which they never even held their word on. They closed my case for no contact when they never sent any thing to prompt me to contact them further after i was told my money would be returned in 7 to 10 business days. Unless you‚Äôre using this app to send money don‚Äôt use it. Any other institution returns your money immediately especially After proof is provided.

Fast forward to this year, when I received a Cash App card in the mail with my name and street address, but a different account ID. I had just gone through this with Venmo and Paypal, so I knew it was because someone had gotten my SSN somehow and used it to open these cards. Venmo and Paypal had great customer service. They closed the fraudulent cards immediately and helped me secure my information. The Cash App did not. Their customer support is through email only. It has now been over two months and they haven‚Äôt even confirmed that they‚Äôve cancelled the card. I have received a few identical emails letting me know that they‚Äôve escalated the case to get it resolved ‚Äúas quickly as possible.‚Äù I am appalled at how poorly they are handling this situation.

As far as folks upset about the new process of paying at the pump, it is not ideal, but before, you couldn‚Äôt pay at the pump at all. Now, it authorizes what you have on the card and will only allow you to pump that amount. Then, it credits the # back to you that you don‚Äôt spend.

Luckily I was at least able to get gas at the storefronts, but none the less I was stuck hours out of town inconveniently unable to purchase anything else such as even food. I‚Äôve never had this problem before but now I‚Äôm realizing it can easily be an inconvenient option to transfer or accept money. I tried contacting them, no phone number. Their only support on the app itself closes at again an inconvenient time of day. I like using the app when it does work but after this experience It left me partially screwed on my trip leaving me to have to borrow money from family.

If you sell a stock after hours you do not see anything about it, not even a pending credit on your account until open of business. Makes sense. What doesn‚Äôt make sense is that if you schedule a purchase of a stock, unlike the sale, your money is immediately deducted from your bank at the time you hit the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù button. However you do not own the stock in which said money is to purchase until the time of the transaction. I emailed support and they said they don‚Äôt have the ability to wait and take your money at the scheduled time of purchase. That was my second response. My first response I was given the open hours of the market which in no way addressed my question and still in the second response they have yet to address why they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have ability to wait to take your money‚Äù at the time they have the ability to give you your goods purchased yet if you sell and THEY OWE YOU suddenly they definitely have the ability to wait until scheduled transaction.

The customer service for this app is beyond poor, which is so unsettling since it is a financial app. I would think when dealing with something as sensitive as bank information and people‚Äôs money, there would be better processes and procedures in place. The only way to contact them is through email. The representative I was working with (Resa) was dismissive of my problem, without investing she deemed it fixed which was untrue. When I corrected her, she attempted to pawn me off to my bank, which was also not the problem. After multiple emails, screenshots, and me insisting that she look into this matter fully and correctly she finally realized it was an issue on their  part. I‚Äôm assuming she submitted some sort of ticket for further resolution because in her final generic email there was a link to a website with an investigation update, even though it references a completely different issue then what I contacted them for. If anyone knows of a better money sharing app, please feel free to refer me. After this I‚Äôm done.

1,2020-02-04 15:46:04,I had been having a pretty good experience with cash app - until I had my father sign up with them for the referral bonus. We were very particular about how we did it to make sure we met their rules. He was new to the service - used my referral link - and connected his bank account. What happened is we both linked the same business debit card we use to add money to the account because we work together. After a week of dealing with their customer support I received about 3 boiler plate word for word responses of lazy customer service that they are denying it becuase of the shared debit card. I pointed out we met all the criteria with proof - but they seemed to scour the policy to deny the referral bonus. Does it make sense to sour a relationship with a customer over $10? I had multiple direct deposits linked to the card and was using it a ton. It seems foolish to tarnish what could be a profitable relationship for them with referrals and card usage fees over standing on foolish principal to deny a bonus. That was their choice - now I have to try and spread the word to cross every t and dot every i to make sure they live up to their promises - otherwise they will scour to deny you too - that is more important apparently than customer service.,They will bend the rules to the end of the earth to deny a referral bonus

Enter it after it asks for your number. If you've already signed up you can enter the reward coupon on the profile menu if you scroll to the very bottom. The service itself exceeds the competition found in PayPal and Venmo in its ease of use. Sign up is super easy and very convincing for friends, particularly when out to dinner in San Francisco where asking the waiter to split a bill is like pulling out your teeth. I like the fact that I can send money to anyone even if they haven't signed up with Square yet. The app is simple to use, swift and clean. There are two options for transferring money to your bank. Either instant deposit which takes a small fee, or the next day. Or you can keep the money in your account, and use the square debit card for any online purchase. You can even request a sleek looking physical debit card and use that anywhere. The app itself seems secure, especially with the touch ID integration for quick payment. This app has changed how I exchange money with friends or even new acquaintances!! I've even started using it to pay rent directly to my landlord. Welcome to the new modern era. Square cash is now my go to for quick payment transfers to friends and family. Overall you should definitely give it a try, especially with the $15 bonus it gives you!!!",Great app! Bonus!!

Here are some ideas I believe it was make the app better: 1. I feel like if the app made it mandatory for all acceptance of money, in other words instead of choosing to accept all payments or just receiving payments without acceptance; all accounts should be able to say yes or no to receiving money to avoid sending it to the wrong person or a certain amount without having to pay the tax every time. 2. BEING ABLE TO RIGHTFULLY REFUND THE MONEY YOU SENT TO THE WRONG OR DEAD ACC. Personally I‚Äôve been put in this situation when my phone broke and I had to make a new cash app Bc my old one was connected to a phone number instead of an email, it was very frustrating waiting on the money that I am still waiting for now a week later. Yes I could‚Äôve put the email in too but I truly feel like this all could‚Äôve been avoid if cash app had more secure policies. With all that being said it‚Äôs a good app it just needs to work on the security stand point overall Bc its very important to a customer to be able to get their money without all this complications.

I'm sure there will be a ""developer response"" below saying how much we care - you don't! Save it for someone else.  P.S. I did try the third direct method you outlined below, which is when I received your auto-reply. Further, it is insulting that the only actual way to obtain a reply from CashApp is via public communication/shamming. That says all one needs to know about your company. Your phone # is fake. It only exists due for legal protection reasons. If you care so much, then why don't you handle the direct inquiry responses yourself? Why do you only respond publicly?",Platform for scammers
5,2021-02-16 09:37:50,"This app is a life saver. Quick and painless to create an account and even quicker to send/receive funds. I‚Äôve been using cashapp for almost 4 years now and definitely recommend it. As with everything, there are a few things I am not fond of. Such as the daily limit issue. On numerous occasions I‚Äôve attempted to withdraw cash at the ATM (most of the time below $500) and wasnt able to do so as Cashapp stated I was over my daily limit. This is a sporadic issue, and has only happened a handful of times. Yet, each time was either my first withdrawal of the day, or the first withdrawal in a few days. Seems to be an error. The other complaint I‚Äôd have is that it is impossible to win a dispute and have your funds reimbursed if the party on the other end either disputes the transaction or charges back through their bank. More and more people are catching on and because the other party may have went through a common branch, CashApp doesn‚Äôt fight the battle.",One of the top 3 platforms of electronic payments !
5,2022-05-13 10:10:04,"First of all, if you haven't used Cash App yet make sure to enter the reward coupon ""WPNZDXX"" on the sign up screen to get a $5 bonus after you send your first transfer over $5!! Enter it after it asks for your number. If you've already signed up you can enter the reward coupon on the profile menu if you scroll to the very bottom. The service itself exceeds the competition found in PayPal and Venmo in its ease of use. Sign up is super easy and very convincing for friends, particularly when out to dinner in San Francisco where asking the waiter to split a bill is like pulling out your teeth. I like the fact that I can send money to anyone even if they haven't signed up with Square yet. The app is simple to use, swift and clean. There are two options for transferring money to your bank. Either instant deposit which takes a small fee, or the next day. Or you can keep the money in your account, and use the square debit card for any online purchase. You can even request a sleek looking physical debit card and use that anywhere. The app itself seems secure, especially with the touch ID integration for quick payment. This app has changed how I exchange money with friends or even new acquaintances!! I've even started using it to pay rent directly to my landlord. Welcome to the new modern era. Square cash is now my go to for quick payment transfers to friends and family. Overall you should definitely give it a try, especially with the $5 bonus it gives you!!!",Amazing App!!

However, IF you have ANY issues you WILL NOT be able to contact anyone except via email. I have a merchant that has continued to charge me monthly and are unresponsive and not even open during Covid, so I can not even get in contact with them to cancel or dispute the charge directly. I lost my job during pandemic, so every dollar counts. Sutton Bank, which is who runs cash app DOES NOT dispute charges OR stop payments. AT ALL. Their canned response from their overseas customer service, keeps telling me to contact merchant, which clearly they are not even reading my issue AT ALL because that‚Äôs not possible. I have been loyal to this app for years now, no more! Additionally if someone hacks into your cash app, which happens more than you think, you are OUT OF LUCK.   Sutton Bank is not traditional bank and you will be screwed. I had a friend who lost 3k after someone sent themselves money and they say there‚Äôs NOTHING they can do. I will go to every outlet possible to shed light on this horrible practice. Again, keep your balance no more than $50 and do not use it for anything outside of small transfers.

I reached out to Cash App to gather more information bc I have no bank account information attached to the card, and I only use the card to transfer money to family. I was informed that my ticket was escalated and someone would reach out to me via email. I have been waiting over a month and spoke to several different reps that ""can't see why my account was closed."" I informed them my concerns were severe. I wanted to ensure no one hacked into my account and did anything with my personal information; however, they don't care. I tried reaching out to Sutton bank, but they need more information because Cash App is a third party. I've reached out to a family attorney, who stated that I have a right to know what's happening. I've gathered information to see where my attorney can reach out via mail or email to collect data, and I am still waiting for a response. I've called asking for a supervisor and was hung up on. So I want to make everyone aware that this is very unusual. This situation has been going on for a month now with no help from Cashapp, and I'm concerned that this may be a scam.",Cashapp is a scam
1,2021-06-12 08:45:05,"I used to use Cash app multiple times on a daily basis for nearly 3 years. This was my main debit card, more or less, because the convenience of it and lack of fees made it the best option. I had my paychecks deposited in the app, I bought and sold and sent crypto, I utilized all the features. Then out of nowhere one day, my card is declined... I log in, and there‚Äôs still plenty of money there, but it says my account has been closed due to ‚Äúunauthorized usage‚Äù, despite never having had any issues, never having any remotely sketchy exchanges, and always using it as intended THOUSANDS of times. The only thing I had changed was adding it to Apple Pay, and having ordered a replacement card as mine had worn out (I never even got to use the replacement). I wrote them over and over again for weeks asking for any information, and assuring them that there must have been some mistake or unintentional error, but I only received silence in return, and could no longer even access their phone support. So, in short, out of nowhere one day, cash app kicked me off and stole my money with no explanation, and no recourse.

And I never did get my money back or get it refunded. They just denied my request and closed my account. And I also tried to verify my account for bitcoins but my identification card is expired and I don‚Äôt have any means or transportation to get another identification card. Everything is almost closed due to COVID and you have to schedule an appointment to get your identification card. This is ridiculous how they treat you when people are dying because of the COVID-19. Some people don‚Äôt even want to get out of there house and wear a mask because this COVID-19 is getting worse instead of getting better and going away. So cashapp can you please help me and give me good answers to my questions when I email or chat instead of just saying anything. We are customers and we pay y‚Äôall to work. If you didn‚Äôt have any customers how would you get your bills paid and pay your employees. Watch out and take care of your customers or y‚Äôall will be out of business and upgrade your staff and make sure they are doing there job and get good training to help the customers and not just tell them anything.

Anyway, the point is I add my account bank and chime account on cash app ‚Äúlinked account‚Äù then I thought cash app probably ask me which one I prefer to transfer money from chime or my own bank to cash app. It actually subtract my chime first but I rather to subtract bank. I can‚Äôt choose what it suppose to be.

Quit because I can't talk to somebody at customer service she just says the decision is final oh my unemployment money is getting put on to this card into the account i'm direct apposite and now that's in jeopardy it's all the money I have.

If they where acutely reading the review above they would have seen that 19 emails have been sent and NO responses. At this point it has been 22 emails.
