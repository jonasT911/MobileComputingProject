What’s with the new icons and why are their two when they seem to do the same thing? I lost the functionality of being able to search my Lists for stuff. Very bad!! I now have you grouping things together for me - other than in my Lists… why??? That’s what the Lists are FOR aren’t they?? 🤦🏼‍♂️ Ugh, come on, guys!

Did someone actually suggest jacking up the Lists and then not tell anybody - just sneak it in??

Its stupid! Because if you click the Missing/broken they ASSUME YOU HAVE IT EVEN THOUGH ITS MISSING. Theres no on site thing to review the company itself. Or file a complaint for its actual team. Then you spend an 1 hour on the phone with someone with an accent so thick you can’t understand them explaining you dont have the item! And it take them the entire hour to understand, for example, “i dont have the item i want a refund” “You….dont have the item?” “No i dont have it” “ah well you can return it to get your refund” “I DONT HAVE IT” “Ohhhh!!! You dont have it, Let me see what i can do!” (30 minutes of waiting) “Ah so it seems we can refund this but we can only do it to the site, maybbe the card” “i want the card refund. Its my money i need it” “Let me see what I can do…. you dont have the item???” “i dont have the item.” “Okay okay” (10 minutes) “you started the return process, yes? Can you return the item??“ “No.”(20 more minutes of basically explaining it in different words I NEVER received the item) “okay okay..

This also occurs after each time you tap “back”, “return to search”. Then after returning back to previous search page you back at the first page and have to advance back to where you were. This “new” format and layout some times do not have a purchase button and only have a subscription button or neither. It’s to much like a phone app now. I’m sorry but i have a I-Pad, not a I-PHONE I do not want them stupid buttons on the bottom like an I-phone app. Also along the bottom of the window there is a black spot that appear when you first open the app and it also appear to be a notification window but blank. I have tried to tap on it, move it, open it, expand it, but nothing works, it just sits there covering half the screen. Also the right side of page is covered up or running off the edge. You can’t reduce size to make page fit, nor move it over to read it. I have deleted app and reinstalled to try and correct problems, and it may work fine or it may not.

You guys don’t take the money off till last minute it can be a few hours or days before you take the money off my card which can be very confusing . I’m the most of it all it sometimes declines it and says I need to revise payment method, there be nothing wrong with my cards or bank accounts because the money still stays there . Then I have to buy another thing separately which won’t be the same price for that I have to spend more only becasue you guys on your end try to have me pay for different deliveries when all together I wanted it done and paid for one delivery.

3,2023-05-23 19:11:18,"I used to like the app - it had most of the same searching ability as the desktop browser. With all the updates recently, it has to reload the page each time I want to add a filter even if it is a deeper level of the same type of filter. I also used to be able to use a search term and select ANY category I was interested in. Now a search term may only yield a few options to narrow a category. Example: I search for “stainless steel” and I can’t refine my search by the category of “arts, crafts and jewelry making”. If change the search term to “stainless steel charms”, I can refine my search by “arts, crafts and jewelry making”. The problem is that “charms” may not be the exact thing I am looking for and I want a more broad search but not so broad that I get entirely unrelated items.  Another big pet peeve of mine is kids shoe sizes. You used to be able to select the shoe size you were looking AND distinguish between little kid and big kid sizes. Now you can’t. But let tell you, there is a BIG difference between a size little kid 1 and big kid 1.

Gave up and went somewhere else. The filters and sort choices aren’t followed. I’m searching for a desk with a specific width, I chose that and alll that I get is everything but that width.  Why bother having a filter if it’s not usable? Or I put a price cap and filter by price and the results are in a random order and beyond the filters I’ve set. Understand if it’s one or two but 70% of results don’t fit the search terms and filters. Need to be able to filter for free shipping even if not prime.

2,2022-06-10 06:37:19,"This app used to be seamless. I don’t know what happened but now, there are times when I cannot click to view the reviews of a product. Usually I can just click on the number of reviews next to the stars and it’ll take me to all the reviews, but now, it’s like it’s no longer hyperlinked and it does nothing when clicked on. So I tried the slower route which is to scroll down until you get to the reviews, but it turns out, when the app is bugging like that, you can’t scroll down to the reviews because the page just stops right after the price area. So no reviews to read at all. I try clearing my app history by swiping out and going back in but that doesn’t help. There’s no remedy right now for this bug.   On the off chance you can click and read reviews, the pictures no longer fully display. It’ll just be the heading ‘Reviews with Images’ and a blank spot where the pictures would be displayed. When that happens, the hyperlinked ‘See All’ is also gone too.   Also, why can’t I select which list my hearted items go to anymore?

I would have to say using the search engine isn’t as easy as it used to be. Even with knowledge in how to use search engines to narrow down your search, I still seem to struggle at times with getting unrelated items, a too narrow search, or a too vague and high result search. This makes shopping difficult and/or time consuming.  On a side note, I would love it if the app had a “dark appearance” setting or “nighttime” setting for the display. I have my phone set to this since I suffer from migraines and try to limit my phone time; the white display of the app can be a bit bright when scrolling and shopping. This display setting choice would be very helpful for someone like me where light sensitivity can impact app usage (I have to do the same thing with my computer settings and turn the brightness down as far as I can because of how bright the screen is).",Overall pretty decent

Oh all the improvements constantly made please put in a dedicated returns section.  2. I can no longer tell how much I spent on a single item in a multiple item purchase. You used to be able to easily see the itemized breakdown with discounts/sales applied to the specific item. Now you just see the full price and all discounts/sales at the bottom.

They said they needed a bank statement for my card or something so I uploaded one. After 24 hours they said it wasn’t sufficient. At this point the money from my account was already taken out (the $15) I uploaded it again with a note saying something like “I uploaded what was requested… i’m not sure what else i’m supposed to include.” And low and behold 24 hours after that they completely terminated my account. They said that more information on the matter would be in my email and to contact them for further questions. I looked in my email and nothing was clarified and it said that i couldn’t reply to the email.

Frequently we use lists to purchase for birthdays or other holidays, and now everyone’s lists are mixed up in these ridiculous categories instead of being able to select the list you are looking for and specifically purchase from that list.

If you want something long sleeve, you put the long sleeve filter on, and you’d expect long sleeve products to show up, but you end up with sleeveless or short sleeve.   Testing this out for dresses too ends up with even worse results, with the fabric type filter just not working most of the time. Let’s say you want something made of cotton, so you use the cotton fabric type filter, and results will range from actually being cotton to having absolutely no relevance to cotton.   Additionally, some of the products that actually do fulfill the requirements for the filter actually get filtered out and don’t appear after the filter is applied, thus making the filter pretty useless, for example, we’ll say that you are looking for a dress solid in color, with long bell sleeves. Applying that filter will end up with some with that requirement, but most of the others having short sleeves, patterns, and regular short sleeves.   Applying the filter and sorting from cheapest also just doesn’t yield good results, where you can end up with that products that have nothing to do with the search in the top result.

Just allow us to scroll down to see everything. It’s annoying we have to select view more 10x just to see what all in the list. It’s also very annoying we can’t hold the heart down anymore to add to our list. Who in corporate agreed to change those features? Worry about when we search for a certain item only that item comes up. Why are y’all worried about how we add items to our list or how we are able to see all items in the list ?! Please fix the app back to being able to hold down the heart and select which list we want to add our items to.

For example, if I’m looking at a tshirt that has multiple colors or styles within the same product listing, it would be convenient to be able to see customers reviews of JUST that selected color, size, or style. A good example of an app that does this perfectly, is the Shein app. You are able to see all reviews, but you can also select the exact items you wish to look at so you aren’t scrolling forever looking for specifics. This is helpful because we are able to see what certain styles look like on certain body shapes etc and a lot of people don’t put what size they ordered in their review - so to have the app automatically have that information on the review so shoppers can see would be very helpful.

2,2020-08-16 04:05:29,I have been using this app for a couple of year now and everything was going fine until this year. I have tried to order twice and I haven’t received either or the packages. The first time I got a full refund but the second time they told me I got a refund and never actually gave me my money back. I tried telling customer service but I don’t think they believe me and i don’t know why. They told me I got my refund back but when you look at my gift card balance it’s 0. I haven’t ordered anything since I placed that order so I don’t know where the money went. I have been having such a hard time trying to communicate my problem to them but they just don’t seem to understand or want to believe me. I also tried sending them screenshots to show them I wasn’t lying but the email they gave me didn’t work. Then they said they would give me a $5 gifts card and I never got it either. This app has been frustrating me so much lately. I just want my packages.,Frustrating

There app is easy to us and have great products and have a lot different items. It’s so easy to use and the app is well organized. You are able to track and see where your packages at without any hassle. And your packages come in time just like it will say when you order something. They nail it on delivery timing. I love this app and everyone I know loves it and I would recommend this and and having a prime member is great too but even without one you can still get whatever you are pretty much looking for. So I rate this app five stars. And my packages are on time and handled with care and the people you deliver are nice and respectful.,Best App Ever!

THEN why oh why is it when I click my little heart/save to list button it no longer lets me choose which list to save it to? Whoever signed off on these decisions is an idiot and did not think about UI or UX at all. And if the person reading this who designed it doesn’t know what UI or UX stands for they should have never been allowed to make these changes.

The search engine is getting more and more difficult to find what you are looking for. Type in one thing and you get 100 returns from products that have nothing to do with what you were searching for. Search for a product by a specific manufacturer and you might get it, 30-40 results down after they have tried to sell you 30-40 different things than what you were looking for.

But someone thought they needed to update the layout of the app. I think I speak for a number of us that we have muscle memory when it comes to apps. You don’t even think about it and instinctively hit the buttons where you want to go. At first it was moving the bottom buttons. So now there’s a light bulb in place of the acct button. So now I have to get used to a new position for that button. Now wishlist are changed. So instead of automatically being in your default wishlist you are in a list that has every single thing you’ve ever added. You gave to find the list you want up top. And NOW they’ve moved the search button to the bottom instead of the top. So while you are typing what you’re looking for you not only have to track what you are writing below you have to track what’s popping up above. It’s not easy on the eyes. Terrible layout.

This may seem like a small delay but this friends birthday is on Saturday and I will be extremely busy on Saturday, so I will likely come back late to receive it Saturday evening. At that point my friends birthday is pretty much over. The worst part is that for free shipping it would have been delivered on Saturday, but I paid $6 extra just to have it arrive two days early, and what do you know I pay extra and it arrives the same time it would have if I got free shipping.

But once the order is processed, it ALWAYS gives a different delivery estimated window. I understand that estimations are estimations, but the fact that it’s always incorrect is quite frustrating, and I’d rather not have an initial estimation at all. I’d like to be home for the delivery, or at least be able to change my options if not. I go back to see if I can pick it up at a locker instead and it doesn’t even give me that option.

I shouldn’t get a partial charge the day of and the. a different charge for another item from the same purchase 4 days after. It’s makes things extremely difficult to track and manage.

If I log out and search again for the same item I get the correct items in the search as well as the correct prices. This is also happening in the iPad.

After a week with no shipping notification, I followed up and customer service informed me I’d receive an email when these items ship because they’re not in stock! This was horrible!

Especially if you buy multiples of the same size.   There should be a separate return page that shows pending and past returns and if there are variations of the item.

Alexa will then interpret our private conversation as a question to her and often interject irrelevant responses to our family’s discussion.  As she does not really remember the context of the initial question/answer, having the benefit of not having to say ALEXA … a second time as a wake up word, creates more of an annoyance than convenience.  Strangely, having turned the follow-up, we still experience random responses to our conversations.  When we asked her what she heard, she replies with a irrelevant word of phrase.

Now when I go to the order page all orders are just all meshed together in order by purchase date where before the items that had not yet arrived would be separate at the top and then items that had arrived under listed by putting date. If I have a order that was backordered I now have to scroll and scroll until I find it to see if it has been updated rather than it being listed at the top of the order page. This will make it so easy to forget about items because they aren’t right there in front of you. For instance I have some shorts that were ordered 1 month ago and still do not have a shipping date and I’m sure I will forget about them because they are now buried in my order page.

What the heck is up with that?! It’s almost like you’re begging people to not waste their time and energy into looking for something and just not buy anything at all because the experience is too frustrating. Also, why did you take away the back arrow when looking at pictures in the reviews?? Somebody needs to rewrite it and do another update, but actually improve it for the users.",Terrible update

I could be in the middle of reading reviews on a specific product that I have searched long and hard for and if I leave the app for any amount of time, that item is gone and I get to search for it all over again. It doesn’t seem to do this every time though, hopefully just a glitch that will be fixed in the near future? (Hint, hint!!) It’s incredibly frustrating since the last version was working very well, at least in my experience. The layout is a bit different too.

Also the app will register that your item has been purchased but will not be updated until later. Extremely frustrating when using your 1- click button only for the item not to be bought when I look at my orders tab.

For example, when multiple items ship together - clicking on “orders” shows you the individual items. Once you click an item that shipped with others, it sometimes says “+2 more” (or however many extra items). You used to be able to click that to see what other items were in that shipment. I’m trying to track when certain items will get to me, but I can’t see what shipped with what, therefore leaving me unable to know when I can expect those items.

There have also been multiple instances where my cart refuses to load. All I see are images of sad dogs and “oops something went wrong”.

Doesn’t matter though if it’s a single item with no variations that is way over price filter or an item that has multiple variations and all of them have prices way over filter selection. It still shows them to me. Also it takes it upon itself to autocorrect words in my search which doesn’t allow me to search for what I’m actually trying to find.

Whenever I can manage to find them, the redesign is ridiculous. The “grouped” option just dumb. I already have my lists grouped how I want them, I don’t need products grouped or showing me all my items. They need to put groups back in list format so we can look at them.

You can’t give selections for every type of item but maybe give a broader selection and allow multi-select narrow (also in the Wish List section). I entered a search for ‘Lincoln Rhyme book series’: the first book in the list isn’t even one of the series books.  Example of a more helpful sort: I have a movie and a book Wish List.

Any financial transaction would have some kind of a double check and this one lacks it. For example a child or whoever has your phone can pretty much go over there and order anything.

2,2020-05-23 18:24:14,How can this app always be so bad? The UI is terrible.  The color combinations are horrendous. Too many taps to get to anything especially at check out. It’s like they intentionally make it difficult to make changes during the checkout process. Changing a shipping address is annoying. The order status page is from the early 2000s. Very limited information and forget viewing order details. Tap on my orders then you have to scroll all the way down and tap again to go to another page just to see the details. Hopefully you never have to reach out to their excellent (sarcastic) customer service. Now that is another issue in itself. A bunch of no nothing bots.

Every time you select a filter, the whole menu goes away, meaning you can’t select multiple items (it closes itself out). So if you’re trying to select a specific department, you might have to open the filter selection 6 or mores times to get to what you need.   e.g., searching for men’s pants means I have yo go from “Any Department > Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry > Men > Clothing > Pants” but each time I select a specific sub-level department, the whole interface closes out and does straight back to the search results. So you have to open it back up, select the next level down, wait for it to go back to search results, and repeat until you finally get to the department level you were hoping for.   So.

I don’t have enough money to be robbed by a corporation so I’m about to get my bank to block future transactions and report this to the BBB it’s absolutely ridiculous that a so called “reputable “ company would do this  and when I called customer service they couldn’t tell me why or even where the account was it was even being taken out of my account for like REALLY??? And when it couldn’t get the money off of one card they took it off my husbands which was NEVER authorized to do so I just happened to make a purchase using it once! So watch your account they will take money out repeatedly and not help you when you call to address and fix it,Keeps taking money out of my account !!
1,2020-07-10 10:58:39,"Platform needs to be re designed. Isn’t user friendly by any means. Difficult to figure out how to message a seller. Even more difficult to figure out how to find your messages and reply. Profile options are ridiculous, I filled out all fields for my profile, then later received an email that said the info didn’t meet community guidelines.... which doesn’t make any sense as the fields I filled out were amazons suggested fields. I’m a house wife and mother, nothing that I do or would add would be against community guidelines. Then the option to rate a product... it wouldn’t let me because I didn’t have the ‘requirements’ come on, I bought a product and should be able to review it, I’ve been on this app for years, I may not buy as much as others but my opinion of a product is just as important.",Crappy layout
2,2019-10-05 20:26:17,"Over recent months my experience with the app has seriously declined.  I use to be able to continuously scroll through my search results, now I have to click the next button after seeing 10-15 products.  I also use to love the wish list option where you could click and hold the parody image and tag it to the bottom of the screen and see a tiny image of it any time. I could compare what I had on my list already to what I was looking at currently, now I must excite the search results and click on my wish lists and go back and forth that way.  The connivence of the app has severely declined.  It’s like you’ve made “improvements” and changes to the app that create more frustration for your consumers.",App changes are frustrating
2,2018-01-31 16:15:46,"I used this app for a couple of years and had no problems until I’ve recently made purchases and my account gets locked. I thought I forgot the password and went through the reset process, but I can’t access my account because of security reasons, very confused on how and why my account is locked. I put in my billing and address in, I’ve confirmed that everything is mine months ago. Once I get my account locked I have to do everything again, and wait additional days to confirm its mine again. I’ve made purchases that was as cheap as $25, but when I try to buy my college textbooks which is about $100 or more, this is when the problems occur. This app is frustrating and problematic.",Very frustrating and disappointed by my app experience

I can go out if it and hit the list again and it comes up. If I put items from my friends wish lists in my phone to purchase and hit proceed to checkout, it asks for the shipping address but will never go past that page. I have to go to my desktop to order the items. Talk about irritating! My Touch ID won’t work to sign in either. I have an iPhone 7 and this started before the 8 came out. I have all of the latest iPhone updates and the app is up to date. This has been going on for weeks! This REALLY needs to be fixed!",Can’t purchase from my app
1,2023-09-19 20:24:40,"The company is trash. They can’t do basic things all other stores can. Try to split a purchase between two payment options? Absolute nightmare. Parts not what you ordered? That’s right almost 100% of the orders I’ve ever received have been Misconstrued in some way. Dishonest, the worst customer support, the only thing that is good is their return policy and news flash…THATS NOT A GOOD THING. It means more people need to return things then keep them which is why if it was difficult to return no one would think it’s worth it to try and see if the order would come out right in the first place. Overall you should really use just about any other retailer besides these clowns. Walmart online is a way better option with the same return policy.",I hope they go bankrupt
1,2023-06-09 00:33:13,"Instead of pushing a big change to all users you could give them more of an option. This frustration stems from the new location of the search bar at the bottom of the page. Every time I scroll through the app I am constantly tapping the search bar. It’s very annoying and not very user friendly for those with smaller hands. Every other search engine or shopping site that I use has the search bar at the top, and if they change it to the bottom, there is an option to put the search bar back. For those that shop with one hand can now use this new feature with ease but the rest who had no issues before now will have to deal with this “reinvention of the wheel” search bar.",Allow more personalization of the app

2,2022-07-08 16:50:18,"It used to work fine, but several months ago the app just goes blank in the middle of shopping or scrolling. It's now happening more and more frequently.  When this happens I have to hit the back button or click on another menu for it to refresh and start working again. It's really annoying because I lose where I'm at and have to start over searching for three item again.  I've tried it on my older iPhone with older IOS software and it still does it.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app.  No help.  I've tried with WiFi vs. cellular data, and still does it all the time. I'm really surprised I don't see more reviews concerning this issue. Am I the only one?",App crashes all the time.
1,2022-05-30 19:15:37,"I can’t believe so many people are okay with downloading Amazon’s app. I personally do not agree with, nor will I accept that every single piece of my privacy be invaded, mined & sold. It’s pathetic how much these tech companies get away with. Laws should be in place restricting the amount of data I have to give up in order to participate in the 21st century. People would never go to Walmart if they were stopped at the door and required to show their medical history, search history, web history, phone call logs and text messages, physical address, banking information, and then be tracked in and out of the store, in order to shop. BUT they will gladly give up all that information in order to buy $100 worth of cheap Chinese crap, that costs 1/4 of what they are paying.",Mining your data
5,2019-12-11 18:49:28,So I pretty much love the app I shop a lot on here I am very active but they never get back to me when I find a problem throughout my day I want to max out my account and they stop or take down some reviews and I don’t even know why I looked at the community guidelines and I have not violated them so they have no reason to take down or block some reviews and being a prime member they should at least be able to communicate with me when needed like how I am a gold member of Uber and they get back to me within the hour costumer service needs to be worked on .,I am a prime member and I am never treated that way
2,2022-01-31 04:49:37,This last update (Jan 2022) killed this app for me.  I have to rotate the app to portrait (tall) to get any buttons to work.  I hate that mode and find it easer to read in widescreen.  It might be ok if the app uses my iPadOS text settings.  In portrait mode the text is too small even with reading glasses.  I see in the reviews where people have grips about the quirks of the app on an iPad. I have encountered many of the same issues.  For a company that has made record profits the past few years you would think they would be better at programing an app and ensuring a usable GUI.  I have decreased my use of the app by half due to these issues.  They should have done more beta testing AND more testing with non-android systems.  Lame.,Last Update = Programing Fail
3,2022-01-08 21:13:59,"The app works great to keep track of packages and go over things. But the changes in the way the filters work in the new update is not user friendly. Before you had one menu were you clicked all of the filters you wanted to apply, now you have to choose one filter at a time, and every time you have to go all the way through the menu to add a filter. I don’t think this is the best way for an app to work.  Recently I been having changes with the language keeps changing back to Spanish and then I noticed some parts are in English and others in Spanish I had to delete it because I was just tired",New update is not user friendly
4,2021-09-26 18:56:39,"App works great, improvements have only made it better. Would rate 5 but, and this is a biggie, the iOS app notifications still won’t chime nor vibrate on the phone when they arrive despite every attempt to resolve this locally through app deletes, reinstalls, fiddling with settings… nothing seems to get audio/vibration to happen when an alert comes through. Even the watch doesn’t make any sort of noise/vibration when an alert comes through. The day those notifications work on the phone/watch like all other notifications work for all other apps is the day this gets a 5.",Great but…
1,2020-04-21 00:26:27,"1. There is absolutely no settings compared to the desktop browser version. They took away any settings in place of making it easier and faster to purchase things. 2. Privacy is in favor of selling any information they can collect on you, browsing and previous orders are never deleted, only hidden. Support claims “information is deleted when the account is deleted.” Easiest way to supposedly delete your collected data is to delete your current account and create a new account which is what I have settled into doing.  In terms of getting orders it works, but that seems all it’s supposed to be able to do, which is a poor excuse for an app. If I want to change settings you have to log into the desktop version.",Mobile app has no functionality except purchasing and tracking
5,2019-10-12 23:16:31,"I’ve have never written a review but that new upgrade got me so upset I have to say something. The app was so easy and convenient to use and now is just a headache. When you looking for items now you have to press next every time you want to see more and if you want to go back you have to press previous. It is annoying and nobody has the time. Why do you think that is a good idea when there are so many items to see? Seriously if you’re not upgrading the app for better, leave it as it was and don’t do nothing. Listen to the customers.","Next, Previous so annoying"
5,2019-08-02 01:13:48,App will no longer display all of the customer questions associated with a product. I tap to see ‘all’ of the customer questions and I’m shown perhaps 12 of them. Scrolling down does nothing..stuck at a page or two of customer questions. Unfortunate because more often than not I find answers to the questions that I have in customer questions. Not finding those answers because I can’t view them keeps me from determining whether or not to purchase a product and makes comparison shopping difficult to impossible. Please fix this problem.,Why?
5,2017-12-28 00:02:41,"Like other reviewers I have been unable to make purchases from my app. I could add items to my cart, but when it was time to check out it would require me to input my password. And after submitting my password, I would receive a “something went wrong” error message. This has occurred over the past several months.  So today I deleted and reinstalled the app, and was able to conduct business as usual. No problems whatsoever.   This is a great app, but it can be frustrating if the above occurs.

Of course, since quarantine started, even the prime packaged have been delayed further back, but many people are purchasing things quicker, so it isn’t really the company’s fault. I saw on many other “bad” reviews that this app was terrible because it did not provide a “dark mode,” but that’s not really important, is it?

But when i want to scroll through my saved for later items it scrolls down for a few then i start seeing double of every item i have, then it does not even load to show more. This is a terrible bug and i want the cart/saved for later items to go back to being in pages that i can click/tap on to see all of my items.

2,2018-02-05 04:14:40,"Where do I start? The layout is clunky and requires an extra step in the drop down menu to go anywhere off of the home page, & you can’t enlarge by tapping pictures anymore- it’s a pain in the neck to have to zoom in and out instead of a quick tap. But my biggest complaint is that on the deals page I can’t choose a size or color- when I tap the arrow, it “blinks” but doesn’t give a drop down for a choice. In other words, if you have to make any choices before ordering, you might as well forget it. Haven’t tried on the other pages yet, but if they are the same it needs to be fixed if you want any orders!

It’s ridiculous how I try over and over to sign into this app it says hello with my name but when I try to use features it asks me to sign in again. It tells me that I don’t have any resent orders when that isn’t true. It asks me for feed back on a delivered package and yet it comes back saying sorry there is no orders in the past 30 days when I have just received a package . Should I be using a different app for orders? A different app to see account info? What’s the deal. This isn’t good. I’m a tad bit disturbed.

How is it my fault that I was sent the wrong item. I was told to re order the item however I had used a coupon and they refused to make up the difference? Again, why do I have to pay for someone else’s error? At the end, the representative Renu kept insisting there was nothing he could do as per the policy and cut the chat before I could even reply.

There should be a way to add items from saved for lasted to a wishlist or to categorize items. The bottom control center bar is useless and ineffective.

That was my son’s birthday gifts and didn’t receive it because you guys are continuing to deliver it to the wrong address. I’ve spoke with several service reps who did absolutely nothing to help me. I also contacted corporate but no one would connect me to them. This my 3rd time being refunded which is ridiculous and a big inconvenience on my end. I need someone to contact me about this because something has to be done about this.

Why not have a search function to speed things up.   Also the videos that auto play are annoying. They eat up data if I’m not on Wi-Fi and most of them are for irrelevant items. If I wanted to watch people talking about products then I would look for the videos myself. Or have them imbedded in the product page as I scroll down. Not on my main page or search results.,Auto video playing

The iPad app isn’t as advanced as the iPhone app. When you add things to the cart, it takes you to the cart every time, which is annoying. The order page isn’t as interactive either, on the iphone app you can write a review from that page but on iPad I have to click on the product and scroll to the reviews to find the “write a review” button. When I’m checking out, it basically just opens up the web browser within the app. It’s simple things but there’s not even a point to having the app because it’s not any quicker or easier to access.",Not Great on iPad

I thought that would improve after the iOS 13 update, but we are now at 14 and the app has still not changed.  The version for iOS 12 was much better.  An example is trying to go directly to reading product reviews.  If you tap on the star-ratings to go to the review section, it loads back to the top of the product page.  If you try taping on the numbered rating hyperlink, nothing happens.  Filtering searches makes products disappear from the search results(eg;by price).  You cant swipe through product images, you have to click on each pic twice to see the next picture.  Using iPad Air A1566.",Non functional app
2,2020-07-26 17:57:20,One of the features I used most on the app was looking at my order history so I could see what I ordered and when. Changing it to only show orders based on when they deliver is a horrible change. I was hoping it was only in the beta version so I uninstalled it and got the regular version. Really disappointed to see this in the regular version. At the very least offer users the option of deciding how to view their orders in profile settings. So we can set it based on what makes sense (order date) vs delivery and not have to change it every time.   I’m a die hard Amazonian. But this change would have me buying what I need from other sites - that’s how much of a negative this is.,Please change order history back

All I want is a resolution- why was my order canceled and how can I get it replaced without missing out on the sale prices that were available on Tuesday when I placed my order?

It also seems that every time I go to use a different app for even a few seconds and try to go back to browsing, I get taken back to the home screen.

As if this wasn’t enough, they hid the buttons under a related searches section.  I missed it initially, thinking the app was broken because I had a search with over 7000 results but the list was too short.   Please stop making updates for the sake of updating.

One thing that is extremely disappointing is meeting community guidelines to rate a product that was purchased. I don’t buy a lot and didn’t meet criteria to rate the product. I feel that if I buy something, rating it is a given. Another way to strong-arm people into  spending more. The reality is I was going to give it an outstanding rating and talk very positive about the product purchase. So you and the seller lose out on a good review.

If you need a package on Monday, you end up getting on Wednesday or even later because you can’t file a complaint until 24 hours have passed since your supposed delivery.

Knowing that this couldn’t have been a mistake because it’s so aggressively awful that you can’t miss it, I’m left to conclude that you intentionally did this to discourage customers from reading reviews.

Now if I want to see the number of ratings I have to click on each item individually instead of simply scanning the overall search results. This is a huge waste of my time.

They’re full of crap. It wasn’t even raining when it was 10 stops away the driver just didn’t want to deliver anymore. That may well be Amazon’s fault as they routinely put packages with earlier delivery times at the end of a shift that ends far later than the delivery time of the packages with early delivery times.

Random “blanking” of pages: While navigating or scrolling pages (most often on individual product pages) the page will suddenly turn entirely blank and I have to hit the back arrow and reset.  This becomes massively disruptive especially when trying to read reviews or product information  Bugs aside, I’ve found navigating product pages to have become clunkier of late. I often want to go straight to reviews, but I have to scroll so much to get there.

1,2019-04-03 01:36:51,This app is getting worse and worse. I HATE that it fills my search results with things that have nothing to do with the search terms I put in. It means you have to scroll through more posts to try to find what you’re looking for and the app is laggier and much slower as you go down the list of search terms. Often times it just crashes or takes forever to load 2-3 searches at a time. But it has no problem shoving “recommended” products in your face that you never asked for. It’s become very much so not user friendly. The app used to be good but these changes the last few months makes me wonder if I should just end my Prime Account and shop elsewhere. This is just too frustrating to use.,It’s getting so bad
1,2018-03-25 13:11:26,"Update March 2018: I hate the new app on iPad. You’ve totally botched it, requiring me to go through many more steps to do things I usually did in only one or two clicks.  It’s sad, making substantive changes because a few snippy developers think something is going to be cool. Do you have a beta test group? One you LISTEN to? I’d like to be on it, so you don’t doink it up so badly again.  —— Previous Review, circa 2015: I live 60 miles from anywhere, and love using this app to help me find things our local stores don't carry. I'm a Windows software developer, so getting my hands on up to date reference books is easy here.  I previously had commented about the kludgey Wish Lists feature.  The updated app's Wish List feature is WAY better now!  Some people might think it's too much effort if you only have one Wish List, but I love it.  I have a Books wish list, a Tech/Geek wish list, a Birthday list for things I'd like to consider for my wife/son next time around, etc.  Checkout is easy.  Searching is easy. And now if you're a heavy wish list user, you have lots of options!",Hate the new interface!

2,2023-10-14 13:43:55,I’ve used the app for years and have always found it helpful for a quick purchase before I forget or to do cross shopping research while at a store. Recently a ‘feature’ that cropped up ends up adding items to your cart if you just pause while scrolling through their item description (vs you clicking buy now or add to cart).This leads to a lot of extra clicks to remove unwanted items and seems like a ploy to get you to buy things accidentally you were only browsing.

If I want to see a video review of a product, I’ll go to the product and watch it. It is a stupid “feature” that just takes up space, and is another way to rack up unnecessary data usage when you click on it by accident.

It’s such a weird user experience. And speaking of UX, if I can select multiple sellers, why use radio dials instead of check boxes and a “apply filters” button?

App should show all items available regardless of what location setting is used but it is filtered for region/location.  I can have things forwarded from the US so app should show everything.   Guess I’ll have to get used to it as unlikely to change.,Like old version

I contacted them on their chat first and the guy said to remove her from the household then add her back. So we did so then she couldnt get back in it. So after over an hour on the phone with multiple workers the problem was still not resolved.

Waiting on delivery for a product standing at the drop point and drive went to a different place and said they “tried to deliver” tried to get there attention and they just drive off. Finally got in contact with customer support for this issue and they just said the local office would try to contact and reschedule for a different day.

I understand it’s a new device but here is some of the critism I have with the app on this new device.   1. The app does crash, which requires me to go back in and start over. 2. I notice that the very top tabs and icons in the app will not function, yet you can scroll down and up and even interact with the bottom tabs and functions.  3. Occasionally freezes.    Other than that, on my previous devices I have not had an issue like this before so this is fairly new and I believe because of the switch to the phone.

It even looks like it's supposed to do something when you click on it because it highlights the number of ratings and underlines it, but nope. Nothin.

The app itself always repeatedly suggests the same items instead of introducing you to new types of merchandise. You can tell they just want you to buy stuff they think they can hook you on.

The menu really needs to be streamlined, consolidated, better mapped.   3. Search results are just weird. it’s usually easier to find an item through google.

It now acts more like a pseudo browser rather than the former version of the app. It lags and begins to not load results especially if you follow links to products store fronts.

1,2020-07-25 17:34:58,The only thing they did to make it cool was being able to link your charity account.   The only reason i shop on this app is because it used to let me have a click feature when you wanted notifications for items that were back in stock. Now i find out when it “available” by price and sold out,Bring back “e-mail when available” feature

Now when I open app all I see are Prime options being pushed that I am not interested in and have never purchased nor will ever purchase.   It’s enough to make me want to cancel my Prime membership!,New layout is horrible

I get so irritated using this app now I won’t even use it anymore. This app was one of the best and one I used more than any other app but what used to be fast and easy now just takes too long when browsing all the items,next! next! next! next!
1,2019-09-21 09:43:51,New filtering is more inconvenient and takes more clicks. Slower. The auto scroll is gone and replaced with a button? Why? The filtering doesn’t let you sort by a custom price range? Why? There are less items on each page for search results meaning I have to spend more time searching and clicking “next” instead of the auto scroll. Horrible,Went backwards in development

They are very unprofessional and after they charge your credit card and your item never arrives don’t expect to get your money same day so you can go get what u need......Terrible that even so called supervisors can not even step in to help resolve. Spoke with Justin C who says managers can’t be bothered to help customers smh....apparently they don’t answer calls or emails. SMH.....,Worst Customer Service

2,2018-09-02 03:18:11,The new update does not allow me to search unfiltered low-high anymore. It takes the 10k possible items you’re looking for and narrows it down to about 100 items and that is not how I want to shop. I buy a lot from being able to shop like that.

2,2023-06-10 21:27:48,I don’t understand why you put the search bar on the bottom!

2,2021-08-30 17:53:28,"Do your drivers read the notes about deliveries? I’m going to say no, no they don’t. Why? Because they leave the packages everywhere but where I ask them to. I ask for them to be put inside the porch. Not next to it. Not at the other door. And most certainly not out in the rain.  I agree with the other reviewer. Give us a space to leave comments regarding the delivery. I always choose ‘didnt follow directions’ (or some similar); no ever reaches out and the next delivery is left wherever they want.

1,2020-07-12 16:46:46,"The new app revisions limit the control you have over filters.

2,2020-05-02 05:24:15,I liked the previous version much better and got used to how it worked. Now it’s as if it’s gone backwards and become less user friendly. I loved that I could drag the icon to my wish list! Now it feels like I’m just on safari instead of using the app.,Less user friendly

2,2019-11-17 19:08:27,The most recent update has broken the ability to sign in if you use multi factor authentication (MFA).

Why have a keep me signed in button if this new version is not going to keep me signed in! Lame. Guess I’ll shop elsewhere and check back when a newer version is out and see if this has been fixed.,Fail
1,2019-11-13 09:45:23,The new update is a terrible disappointment. Whenever you select new categories the app reloads the page. Filtering your search used to be an easy thing now it’s just 5min of back and forth.  Oh and sometimes the app will decide to send you back to the start page for no reason forcing you to restart the search query.  UNDO THIS DAMNED UPDATE!,The new app update is ridiculous

1,2019-10-17 00:25:04,The recent update is terrible. It will not keep me logged in no matter if the “stay logged in” box is checked or not.  When browsing items you have to click the next button to see the next page of items. It’s like it’s gone back in time 5 years. Please change it back. This is intolerable.,Terrible update!!

2,2019-10-03 01:23:12,There are some actions you can’t do in the app such as view invoices. For these actions I try to use safari on my phone and it will always redirect me back to the app. So when I need to do certain things on my phone I have to delete the app and redownload afterwards. Wish this wasn’t the case🤦‍♀️,could be better
3,2019-09-28 03:18:28,Since the new update any time I choose something it always says something went wrong and shows me a picture of a puppy. I like dogs and all but if I’m trying to purchase a product I’d like to see the product not an error msg and a puppy. 😔,Error msgs

3,2019-09-24 01:47:08,"Recent update filtering - the screen refreshes every time you change the filter, very annoying (going down 5 product categories means owning filter 5 times, same if you wanted to filter 5 brands), how did this get accepted into production?",Recent update filtering
1,2019-09-22 20:39:57,"Infuriating! This app shows you results immediately, then you have to go back to filters to add 1 more filter. By the time I get my 5 filters on I waste 5x more time than it took me in past versions. Don’t show me search results if I’m not even done entering the parameters of my search! Is that too much to ask? 🤷🏻‍♀️",Can’t filter for several things at once anymore
3,2019-09-16 16:16:18,I hate the new update! Instead of being able to just scroll you see like maybe 10 options and then are forced to click the next page. So annoying!,New update

But don’t use the app to order anything.",Orders don’t even go through
1,2019-09-01 15:27:16,"Prior to the latest update, I loved the app. I regularly (almost daily) shopped using the app because I can't stand the mobile or desktop site search/filter capabilities.

There have been several purchases that I didn’t go through with because I got a “uh-oh connection lost” message when I attempted to go to my cart to finalize the purchase (or other area of the app).,What happened to the app?!?! It’s horrible now!
1,2019-08-08 08:57:41,Still useless without the wishlist tray. I recommend the developers STOP releasing any new updates until the next one brings back functionality that was ALREADY THERE and made this app usable. Why steal this accessibility feature from your users? Why make people less likely to buy more items? Why punish customers for their loyalty?,Lost functionality
1,2019-07-28 20:36:04,Ordered a package it came late. I didn’t get everything I ordered. I also contacted them asking about my package and told them I’m still missing some things in my package.

1,2021-05-21 13:46:19,I got this so I could log in from my cell phone. I can’t log in using the app or the browser because it asks me to approve the log in in a text. Whenever I do it says it was approved and then nothing. It doesn’t log me in. This app or just the mobile version in general is worthless on my iphone.,Worthless to me

And the worst...no forward browsing button. A mega billion dollar company and this total junk app?? This app is an abomination.,Terrible for shopping
1,2021-04-07 14:05:46,This new update that just happened on the app is absolute garbage and has been giving me issues and not working whatsoever. This app update is not good for people with iPhones. I just deleted the app and I don’t plan on re downloading it. I’m not dealing with the frustration y’all created just to order stuff. I’ll just go back to eBay.,Awful new update is trash. Change it!

4,2020-12-11 11:12:35,This means back button should not be on the top.  It means most of the often used buttons should be on the bottom  Remove buy again from search orders.

2,2020-09-09 01:45:51,I didn’t know they could downgrade the app as much as they did. It’s like they tried to over simplify it and somehow made almost nothing work. No QA especially. Frames on top of frames that lock you on a screen. Details hidden in 5 different actions. Complete garbage.,Newest update makes it almost unusable

1,2020-09-06 13:55:35,I swear the people that design apps don’t use them.  I get it they want you to spend more time using it.  But the latest redesign is horrible.  Everything worked perfectly in the old design and there was no need to change it.  This is simply a change for the sake of change.  This is why apps are ruined all the time.,Another pointless “redesign”

Or was there a competition how can we make the worst update in the history of app updates or did you do it for BLM so they can have something real to argue about?,Horrible update! We’re you guys on drugs?
