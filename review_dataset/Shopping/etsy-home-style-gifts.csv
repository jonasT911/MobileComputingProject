I am a business owner myself, and I normally do not call companies out, but I’m making an exception with this one, because I try to handle it very professionally you don’t advertise something and not put it in Pacific’s on how that advertise met goals and when you place the order according to the advertise it then when you receive your order, it’s not what you ordered then they go in and they change your order. Exactly to what they sent you and then they play like they don’t understand but being a business owner, you know you take notes you write down what you ordered you keep an inventory of what you ordered I mean that’s what business people do you make a checklist of what you need called inventory sheet so I would like for companies to honor their mistakes and it’s OK to make a mistake but it’s not to make it seem like it’s your customers fault, and that the customer is the one who made the order like that because if the customer is a customer that has ran a business for years trust me that customer know what they are doing that’s for future references so make sure that you know that that customer has a record of what they did order",Faithful Buyer
5,2021-11-16 17:05:22,"I love Etsy. First off I enjoy helping out other artists and individuals more than big corporations. I have had some wonderful quality items I’ve given as gifts or kept for myself. The layout is easy to use. You can buy the item straight away or put it in the cart and buy all the items together. Some shops give discounts on multiple item orders. Etsy shows you which shops have items on sale and how many other people have that particular listing in their cart. You can favorite a shop or an item that you can easily go back to later. You’re able to put those items in a group, which is useful in the form of gifts you have in mind for one person or event like Christmas. These groups seem to be unlimited as I already have a bunch I’ve made. You have seller and buyer feedback and you can contact your seller. They show similar items to what you’re looking for on the same page. You are able to see turnaround time and the general location area of the shop, then pay through credit card or PayPal which makes it convienient.",Creative gifts
3,2023-09-20 16:28:02,"I love Etsy to shop from small businesses don’t get me wrong- but there are a few things that make the desktop site more appealing. [TLDR; homepage has nothing to do with my interests, tracking is a bit off in-app]  First: the homepage. It’s a cool idea to have little videos sellers can upload to promote themselves, but literally none of the videos are related to the shops I follow or the things I buy. I mostly follow gothic artists and classic literature themed shops, but all of the videos are about modern farmhouse decor and boho style clothes. That’s cool and all but doesn’t appeal to me. And I have found shorts that DO appeal to me after a long time of scrolling, so it’s not that they don’t exist. An algorithm would really help both customers and those posting the videos. The app also gives you a “because you viewed” section, which I really wish was dismissible. Sometimes I accidentally click on things that don’t interest me or buy something for a friend and it messes up these sections until I clear all my viewed.  Second: the tracking notifications. It simply doesn’t work. It sends to my email just fine, but it still shows something I ordered is in transit despite having received it weeks ago. Again, the emails work, so maybe my app is just bugged. Anyway, that’s it. Sorry for such a long review ^^;! Other than these the app works as intended.",It Could Be Better !
2,2022-12-05 21:05:09,"The app overall is very functional and good for shopping, but the amount of forced advertising sometimes makes me regret having it. I turned off all notifications because I couldn’t specify that it should notify me about shipping and DMs and not advertisements for item recommendations. The entire front page of the app consists of recommendations based on your history, which is fine, but now my updates tab (which is normally for sales, coupons, restocks, etc) gets cluttered constantly with MORE recommendations, and I can’t turn that off. And the search function is a joke compared to what it used to be, with only about 25% of the listing results actually being even vaguely related to my search words, and the rest being—you guessed it—recommendations based on what it thinks I might want instead of having anything to do with what I’m actually looking for. The constant hounding about leaving reviews for items is super annoying also, although I’m more sympathetic to that since shops do need reviews for their business. Still, annoying. Let me opt out of SOME of those reminders, at least.  Etsy is a business, I get it, but when you prioritize shoving recommendations down my throat to the point that it hinders app functionality, it’s awful. Trust your users to have the brainpower to look for what they want instead of needing it slammed in our faces on every single page.",Recent formatting is super annoying
3,2023-10-25 04:23:41,"Let me start by saying I’ve order from Etsy quite a few times and though I’ve had to message sellers about my product on more than one occasion I’ve never not received my purchase until now. And Etsy won’t help. I placed and order with Cowboybootsusa on 12/6 seller Communication was fine, March 27 order was sent but I did not get what I ordered at all. March 29 I reach out to the seller and Etsy for a solution, the seller agreed to remake the boots and said he would need 3 months. No problem, 3 months later I reach out for status, July 3 seller said he was in the final stages and would send them end of the next week. August 5, I reach out and seller says he had unexpected delays in production but would mail in 2 weeks. September 5 I reach out again and I’m told staff had COVID so there were delays he would send in 2 weeks. Now October 8, I reach out yet again and not only do I have no boots the seller has stopped responding to me. Etsy support says they can’t help because it’s passed 100 days from original delivery date, seems like something the seller knew. And I obviously didn’t. I’m out over $400 because Cowboybootsusa did not do what they promised and Etsy won’t help despite all the communication on their site between me and the seller. I’m not sure if I trust the sellers or Etsy at this point. Be careful when ordering from this site.",Lost trust
2,2023-09-24 22:22:10,"I have been buying off of Etsy for over a decade and have never felt the need to speak up about any changes made to the shopping experience, until now. The recent update to this bizarre “chat-style” search engine has made searching less efficient in that 1. I can’t find what I’m looking for as easily as I had in the past with the previous, standard search bar as this new version now brings up categories in the same realm, but not what I asked for (My descriptions are precise considering I’ve been an Etsy shopper for long enough to know what terms to include, so being vague isn’t the issue) and 2. The robot/AI(?) responding takes far longer to load than the previous search bar. I understand the idea is to stay relevant in a sea of high-tech everything and I understand that having the robot suggest other, similar items would theoretically lead to more sales but overall, Etsy is making less revenue from me, and I'm sure others, because this new interface is slower, not as accurate, and irritating to deal with resulting in me spending less time on the site and more time looking elsewhere for what I want. At the very least, please consider including in the app settings the ability to revert back to the previous search method via a toggle, so both robot-lovers and robot-haters can continue to enjoy the app.",Begging for the option to turn off ‘chat’ style search
4,2023-09-05 01:36:30,Been purchasing through Etsy for many years and was surprised recently when my entire buyers account was deleted.  Someone decided to change my account to a sellers account-extremely bizarre as I have never sold on Etsy ever.  My entire buyer’s history along with all my favorites was deleted.  It took months of persistent emails demanding help from yet another customer service person who had no idea what they were doing.  Finally my buyers account was restored but without my purchase history or favorites. Clearly customer service needs improvement.  The way the site works is also very slow and outdated.  Changes that have been made only slow it down further.  Investment in new servers might be a good idea!  However-  I decided to stay here because there are still some artisans who sell only here.  And I do purchase. However the other issue is that many of the single artist sellers have left.  Most of the sellers are Chinese companies who sell for Pennie’s on the dollar on Taobao except on Etsy they often raise their prices.  I think it is sad that true artists have been pushed out and these high volume companies have taken over in many cases.   This is all My current opinion.,Great for gifts but website still needs improvement
1,2022-07-16 00:27:36,"I hated this app, it’s slow, it’s buggy, it crashes, it’s worthless. That was fine, I deleted it and continued to use the browser version of the site, which I prefer anyway because it allows me to have multiple tabs open to compare items, it’s a major advantage of online shopping and I’ll never understand why retailers are so determined to undermine that advantage by forcing users to go through their terrible apps. Only now when you try to do certain things, like go to shops to see what else a vendor is selling, it brings up a broken ad for this terrible, broken app, and there’s no way to close or circumvent that ad. There’s a button that SAYS ‘continue to mobile site’ but it doesn’t work, nothing happens, I can see the stuff I want to look at scrolling past in the background at the top and bottom of the screen but there’s no way to make the ‘download the app’ screen go away. Clicking on the ‘download the app’ option doesn’t make it go away either, it just brings me here, so I can review this pointless, defective app that’s so spectacularly broken it makes it impossible to use Etsy at all on mobile. I tried through safari and chrome, I even downloaded this pointless, broken app again, but I’m not interested. Guess I’m not shopping on Etsy anymore? I just wish it had broken before I’d placed that last order so I could still check on it.",An app so broken it broke the website!
2,2023-06-25 23:56:33,"**Updated to add Solution: I turned off the badges under notifications. Now the forced reviews are benign and I can shop and review in peace.**   This has got to be the most annoying feature ever. I purchase my planner stickers from an Etsy vendor and the nature of the product easily leaves me with 5+ notifications for reviews every single time I make a purchase. Once I’ve reviewed one, I’ve reviewed them all—they’re stickers!!! I shouldn’t have to do a review per item if they’re the same item in a different color/pose/character etc.! I should be able to decline leaving a review. There’s currently no way to get rid of the notification other than submitting a review which is tedious to boot! Too many clicks! It appears to be one, but it’s actually 7 clicks minimum for ONE review. At the very least you could streamline it! And adding the picture and the feedback need not be separate! I hope my vendor moves away from Etsy for this reason alone. At this rate, Etsy is going to force customers to put pressure on the vendors (by leaving poor ratings) just to make them get rid of it. A 4/5 rating of strong-armed reviews is different than a 4/5 rating of free-will reviews. Ratings mean less when they’re forced! If I take the time to leave a rating it’s because I am thrilled or sorely disappointed. Do better, Etsy!",Eliminate Forced Reviews!!!
4,2023-05-10 23:37:14,"I shop on Etsy a lot and love supporting small businesses in the United States. That being said, my biggest complaint right now is that Etsy seems to allow foreign businesses to present themselves as US businesses and I would like something to be done about that. For example, why is a jewelry shop that is supposedly based in North Carolina actually shipping orders from Turkey?! I read reviews and I read ‘About’ the shops and time and time again, a shop that says it’s located in the US is obviously not located here. It’s aggravating.   My second complaint right now is the search function. I put in very specific criteria and I get tons of results that don’t fit it. And the items marked as ‘Ad’ are the worst because even if you sort by price (low to high, for example), the Ad items show up everywhere so it’s not actually in order by price. I also find that the same items show up in the search results grid over and over. Again, aggravating!  I feel like the Etsy search feature used to be better and if the site gets overrun by foreign businesses pretending to be in the US and selling shady merchandise, then I’m going to have to shop elsewhere. Just my 2 cents!","Love Etsy, but it needs some changes"
3,2023-03-13 21:01:23,"I love that genuinely innovative things people make and sell. Some of my favorite pieces of jewelry come from Etsy shops. My personal interactions with customer service have been great and I love the variety. However, I’m a consumer frustrated with a few things. And I can never truly only imagine this frustration asa  seller. For one, I understand inflation, but taking away more money from the sellers but still upping tax? Two, money sellers and consumers have called out the slack of eligibility requirements to sell items on the site after the pandemic. I understand it’s to try to help more small business worldwide, but there’s a difference between similar items being sold and copycat manufacturers that very obviously steal item designs from authentic business and sell cheap poorly made items that take credit for and take over real handmade or vintage items. Three, there’s a reason why so many businesses so many small owners on your site are going on strike. None of the demands suggested for the Etsy Strike subreddit and overall union have not been considered at all evidently. I love the overall concept and the many small businesses are great but there’s a reason people are moving to Shopify and other selling platforms.","This goes the entire site as a whole, not just the app."

I appreciate that there are multiple options of ways to pay so that I do or do not need to share information that I do not wish to with a third-party.  What I do not appreciate is the force recommendations. What I mean by this is that on the app as well as the website I am harassed constantly by and see the website and the app itself to review every single item that I have purchased. I do not wish to do that. They are times where I would just like to purchase a wedding gift or whatever and go about my business. I would like there to be an opt out opportunity to not be continuously harass not only on the website. But also in the app that if I do not wish to recommend something and I’ll review it, I do not have to. I was harassed by the seller wants for leaving a review that they did not believe was necessary so therefore I will, and do not leave reviews.

Unfortunately the buying and repeat buying process is constantly difficult and needlessly time consuming. I’m constantly frustrated with the platform as it makes it very difficult to search previous purchases in order to buy an item again. The list of purchases should have a search bar so I don’t have to endlessly scroll through (and wait to load) my purchases. Also: Limiting my cart to only 100 items is also very frustrating. This make sense for someone purchasing handmade goods. I get that limiting cart items encourages customers to actually complete a purchase but for someone who is constantly buying multiple tiny items it’s really frustrating. You’ve designed this platform without someone such as myself in mind. It’s very discouraging and makes me want to shop elsewhere. Do better You’re missing a great opportunity to cater more to makers and their supply needs. Update 8/22. I believe I wrote this review over a year ago, and I still feel very much the same way.

It’s gray not black and the wrong size. I’ve been looking for 2+ hours trying to find a receipt that shows what I actually ordered. I’m not sure if I messed up the order or they messed up and shipped wrong item. I can see I purchased it but has no details on what size or color I ordered. If you touch the actual item it just takes you back to their page to buy another one. I scrolled through the help page and goggled it-apparently the little email saying you place an order with this shop that has view order link is all you get(clicking the link takes you to the generic receipt showing the product but not the specifications you ordered) I had this problem before when I ordered a set of acrylic nails. They were beautiful and the size I ordered was perfect so I wanted to place a new order. Never could find the details showing what size I ordered so I had to get a new sizing kit and start all over. I don’t think it is too much to ask to see exactly what you ordered on your receipt/my orders page.,Need Better Receipts!
1,2019-11-25 07:56:05,"This app seriously ruined my life. Etsy doesn’t give a crap about sellers as long as they are making money by pulling in enough buyers. Every time a case is opened against you they ALWAYS choose the side of the buyer and take money from your account without permission. All 3 cases I had against me were not my fault. The first one was a customer being unhappy with a product 3 months after receiving it when my return policy clearly states send me a message within 1 week and mail back within 2 weeks. I refused to accept the item after 3 months and they opened a case and I didn’t give them a refund and Etsy took the money straight out of my account. The second time was a customer demanding a refund saying they never received their item when their tracking number clearly stated that it had been delivered weeks ago, and Etsy once again took money from me without my permission. They also don’t take into account that items cannot be shipped on Sunday so customers get mad when their item is shipped a day late. Now they have a new policy where if you don’t offer free shipping your items will not pop up at the top of the list for customers, so you are basically forced into free shipping and lose customers by increasing your prices for no reason.

The kicker, they have coupons automatically sent to you if you have favorited an item or put it into your cart. I was trying to order an unique wedding band for my fiancé but accidentally put two of them in my cart and instead of removing one, I deleted both.

There’s no phone number, no instant chat within the website or application and no email, there’s no way you can contact them directly. The only way you can contact them is through their useless messaging system where you leave a message and wait (a month? a year? or maybe more??) to be contacted by them to solve a problem you have. Most likely they haven’t even read my messages, they may all have ended up in the trash. Disgusted! I’ve never had such an experience with any other company before.

On this particular site, I couldn’t see the variation in what I bought and it wasn’t noted in the image you saw so I had to contact the seller to clarify, especially since on some sites in Etsy, you have to pay to return shipping so you don’t want the wrong item.

3,2023-06-08 01:29:56,"I love the beautiful, unique items that Etsy has to offer. No other online store has such a large variety of these types of products, so I really do appreciate that. However, Etsy has several flaws. The cart pop-ups are incredibly annoying. I can’t even keep items in my cart anymore, I have to put stuff I want to buy soon in the save for later section. The pop-ups appear at least three times so closing them out once or twice doesn’t work. Now I don’t even need to have the item in my cart for the pop-ups to happen, they will appear if I’m just browsing the search results. Ugh. I hope they realize what a terrible design this is. No other website that I know of harasses their buyers to this extent. I’ve also noticed many Etsy sellers who are reselling items from Shein and AliExpress at 10x the price. Etsy does nothing when I notify them about this, even though they say it’s against their policies. They won’t enforce this rule. Be especially careful when buying earrings, check those Chinese sites first to make sure you aren’t being ripped off. Also, the website is buggy and crashes at least three times a day, usually more.",Etsy Review

Etsy isn’t perfect and there will be times you get a dud but 9 times out of 10 I’ve been super happy supporting people in the kink community with all my purchases. With Klarna I was able to get a great deal of custom items for like $30 bucks a month on auto pay. It’s a no brainer. You pick out what you like, open Klarna and shop Etsy, the transaction is seamless and worth the wait. Tracking numbers and a way to contact the seller all make this easy to do with no stress.

I bought a Christmas gift for a friend in early December; it had an ETA if 2-3 weeks yet it JUST arrived mid February. There needs to be some sort of system of accountability that penalizes business owners if they take longer than the projected dates posted on their page - some sort of incentive for them to make sure they meet their own deadlines. Perhaps refunding a percentage of the cost of the item back to the buyer after a certain amount of time? If you claim that your products ship within two to three weeks, and it takes two MONTHS on more than one separate occasion, it is a huge deterrent to me from wanting to buy anything else from here again. I understand life happens, and some things are out of their control; I’m completely okay if it’s a few days (or even a week) past when they said I would get it, as long as they keep me updated. But that rarely happens. Most of the time I just get no response until I finally open a claim, which I really don’t like doing.

Etsy is a Mecca for specialized, beautiful items that you may not be able to find anywhere else, and it serves as a community for creative people. It is user-friendly and easy to operate, and the prices are fair. My biggest complaints about Etsy are that they do not promote truly handmade items as much as they used to, and that they are too quick to shut down a shop at the first sign of a conflict with a customer. There is no hearing process or chance to course correct. I’ve seen too many shops get shut down for no reason. I love being an Etsy seller and I am happy, but I no longer trust them as much as I used to. I don’t trust that if there was ever a problem with my shop, even after 14 years, that I could receive proper customer service and feel heard and honored. I have no first hand experience with this as my shop is still in tact.  This is my honest assessment that I would tell a good friend.

I found a listing on Etsy from “Cosplay Dream Shop” that promoted cheap commissions and I though I’d give it a whirl. Set up a payment system and I sent my payment through PayPal (what the seller told me to do) and what turned to months of messages of “when will it arrive?” to “I need my money back because you violated our agreement.” Commissioner stopped replying on the Etsy chat and I found her on Facebook and started messaging her there and she said she’d get my cosplay to me. I contacted Etsy to see what could be done and they said to call PayPal since that’s where the transaction happed so I called PayPal and they told me to call my bank because there was utterly nothing they could do. I call my bank and they inform me they also can’t do anything because the transaction was over 150 days or something and the only thing I can do is continue to message the seller on Etsy. It has been an utter nightmare and I’m angry and upset that no one can do anything. So in other words, Etsy is a platform for easy scams and trickery to occur.

3,2023-06-26 12:50:44,"I really enjoy browsing through the different shops, but with the newest update, the receipt page for an item is contradictory. At the top, it will say that an item has shipped, but at the bottom, it will say that it hasn’t shipped yet. It’s very confusing, and I’m not sure which prompt to trust. Small error, but an error nonetheless. Another issue I had pertains to where a product supposedly ships from. I had one item ship from California to my home across the country in four total days. But an item that supposedly ships from my resident state hasn’t even shipped in the same amount of time. Not necessarily the fault of Etsy, but I would suggest that a shop be required to provide Etsy with a legitimate location to ship from. I have a feeling that not all locations listed are accurate. Sellers should also be required to ship sold items within a set amount of time, otherwise have their ability to sell their wares on the platform to be revoked. Also, before you purchase anything, ask the seller if they ship through a service called Ding Hong. There have been many instances where sellers shipping through Ding Hong are scamming customers.","Really Good, but…"

Anyway, Etsy once was a place to find *only* handmade and vintage goods, but it’s been about a decade since they said “eff that, our shareholders need more,” so they opened up to selling cheap mass-produced disposable products, and squeezed out thousands of independent artisans whose keyword searchability suddenly went in the toilet. Still bitter about that. Anyway, here’s my original review:  The conversation view is nice. Long overdue. Now if only you can make the seller/store management into something larger than an iPhone-sized sub-view on iPad, we might be getting somewhere. Yet STILL tapping on Etsy notifications takes me to this useless splash page for following/trending. And why doesn't the Following screen reflect any of the stores I'm following on the etsy website? Do I have to maintain separate lists for the same function? That seems a strange choice. And for now, since I don't want to start curating a second list, I'm continually greeted by a screen of blinking rectangles whenever I tap on a message/sale notification from this app. It's irritating, and the website is a far better experience on iPad.

I bought some jewelry sets and even though I was refunded the scammers gained access to my account and my personal information and now I’m just sitting here waiting for Etsy to respond which people say could take weeks. The scammers also have fake customer service numbers you can call and get scammed further. They have my bank details, adress, phone number, PayPal info and so on. When this is over I will never use Etsy again and will tell everyone I know about my experience and not to buy anything on there.

My husband who can’t stand flea markets, and as he says peoples old junk loves me to show him things on ETSY. Plus it’s not just the VINTAGE items.

You know that there’s something not quite right when you see the same photos in multiple shops that were also on Chinese mega-sites. I do appreciate the shops that will custom-make garments. That’s a service that’s necessary for the plus-sized in particular - I had to stop at 1X because customers sized larger refused to pay a higher price than I was charging for a small. Back to the situation - I’ve always put the mandated care and content labels in my garments, but content is sorely missing on the imports from China. I purchased a rather pricey sweater from Alicewool that she stated was cotton. It started pilling if you looked at it cross-eyed. Within 24 hours it became some you wouldn’t leave the house wearing. I tested the yarn, and got very little ash, and a hard plastic-y blob - it was most likely a petroleum based synthetic, with a single cotton thread.

I checked to make sure it wasn’t my phone and when done I asked the shop for a new charger (they state this is not an issue even if I was the one to break it) I contacted Etsy and opened a case. Eventually after some time the seller stopped replying and ignored me. This raised a red flag. I escalated the case with Etsy as to have them over look it and the replies take forever, they also aren’t fixing the issue. First, they ask for photos which I can not supply because how do you take a photo of your phone not charging?

Just a few days ago, I was able to effortlessly find numerous options when I searched for ""mandrake"" in my quest for Halloween costume props. Today, however, the experience is nothing short of frustrating. Instead of results, I was met with a discouraging message suggesting I try different words because they had nothing to offer. This abrupt decline in search quality is upsetting and time-consuming.  I'm relieved that I had previously saved some options using the heart/favorites feature otherwise I would have been out of luck. Furthermore, the new search feature takes an eternity to yield any results.  In all honesty, I cannot fathom why the app developers thought this new search feature was an improvement.

I was SO happy when they finally updated the options for search filtering because that was a long long time coming, but recently my searches are dominated by ads paid for by the stores owner. I’m used to Etsy ads and they’ve even helped me find new favorites. However, most of my search results are now ads, and they’re ads that are no longer even pertinent to what I’m looking for. If I’ve searched for sunflower necklaces, adjusted the filters to what I want, I don’t want to see sunflower wedding invitations suggested, or sunflower art prints being suggested. Seriously?! At least suggest the same thing I’m looking for, even if it’s a $200 item and my search criteria is the $0-$50 range. That at least I understand. Mixing completely different categories is obnoxious and makes it hard for me to see what I’m looking for. The second problem with the ads lately is the quantity. I’m used to seeing 2 ads every so often, but I’m seeing 4-6 ads clumped together now and coming up so often I don’t know if it’s still on my search at all.

It is usually by the yard but on Etsy you sometimes have to go all the way into your cart before finding the price is not for a yard but it is for a fat quarter, an 1/8th,  or 3/8 yard, 1 yard etc. It makes it very hard to compare fabrics. Normally it would be no big deal but when a fabric is needed now it gets very annoying to open an ad just to find out it still doesn’t specify how much you are getting for $3.40. After reading the entire ad you still don’t have an indication. So now you go to the cart to see what you bought for 3 @ $3.40. One would expect about $12 with tax but instead it said $38 and that didn’t include shipping.  I did this kind of searching for 6 hours yesterday between 2 sites and left everything at your site except for one small purchase.

My other main issue is the notifications for reviewing items, and the frequent glitching that comes along with them. I don’t like the fact that notifications show up every time you get an item, forcing you to review it to get the stupid thing to go away. It feels very fake on Etsy’s part. On top of that, there is a very frequent glitch where the app will show that there is a notification in the reviews section, but when you go to click on it, there is nothing there.

No one buys on Etsy knowing  the seller’s gender, race or sexual preference. But when you market and promote  these groups separate and apart, identifying them by these arbitrary and superficial labels, as opposed to just being “human beings” with a product to sell, you reduce yourselves to immature and shallow people. And if I would ever choose to buy a product based on one of these labels, let alone buying something only because the seller is a white straight male I would be embarrassed and sad to be part of such a reversed bigoted world we worked so hard to dismantle.

I don’t usually write reviews, but Etsy is fun to peek at periodically and I do usually always buy something.   The individual owners of shops with Etsy let you know where their products are made and where they ship from. During the Civid 19 stay at home time, I enjoyed looking at Etsy jewelry and found some special treasures.  Quite a few, actually and for reasonable prices.   A few years ago I ordered a beautiful handmade stone Fairy house. It was made in a shop in England and sent from there. Just about a foot around and adorable. I had messages from the makers of the Fairy house and happily thanked them for the good packing for shipping from England to Massachusetts.   Made mostly of stones, it was heavy.  Love having English stones! It’s fun to have a little sense of where things actually come from, too. Found lots of little fairies and fairy house outside furniture on Etsy.   The Etsy adventure is always finding something new, unique, handmade, beautiful or useful and not necessarily knowing what you are searching for. Hahaha…..until you find it!

My biggest complaint about this app though: on several occasions, I have left honest—not brutal or bashing, but simply honest reviews about a few of my transactions. When you leave a review about a purchase experience on this app, the seller can continue to publicly comment on your feedback. To me, this is totally bizarre and not what I’m looking for in a shopping experience. It creates a confrontational environment. And no one wants to read all that! If I’m leaving feedback because something needed to be improved, I’m not looking for an argument or justification.

When browsing, the photos are slightly too large and often you can’t see the full product in the thumbnail without selecting it (could be something to drive more exposure, but this was a recent-ish change).  2. Also when browsing, things I’ve already saved / favourited for later isn’t showing on the thumbnail anymore. Again, I need to select the item to see if I already have it saved or not. Previously wasn’t like that and feels like a loss in functionality.  3. Allow filtering on purchases. Sure they’re in order of most recent, but it would be great to be able to filter on key things, such as shipment status or if it’s been delivered. Otherwise, when I make a purchase that has multiple items that all ship at different times from different sellers, I often have to dig to find them.  4.

We have been seeing veterinarians for years, but cannot figure out why she does it. We are coming around to the idea that it may just be behavioral, whether it is something anxiety related or obsessive compulsive... we have tried every e-collar under the sun, without much success! This e-collar has been the biggest help. I can leave it on Pepper Ann for extended periods of time and know that she is not uncomfortable. It is soft, flexible, and lightweight. She is not scared when she wears it, and it barely slows her down. It is actually a bit of a fashion statement! At first she could not figure out how to scratch her face with it at all. And over time she is now occasionally successful at scratching (she’s a cat, she’s smart). But overall it does the best job at preventing my cat from harming herself, and she can stay comfortable. Her quality of life is so much greater since we found this e-collar.",Best e-collars for cats

I sent in my husband’s shirt collection to surprise him. After 7 months of asking what was going on, being told the day before Christmas Eve that it wasn’t coming, purchasing another last minute gift, requested they just send my irreplaceable shirts back. No luck, she offers to finish it and refund, says health problems came up, all kinds of excuses. Come March I finally start a case. Not only was it difficult to get the case going the support was minimal at best. She said she already sent it and they asked for proof. It did finally show up on her second attempt to mail it correctly. I requested a fulfillment of that refund but only expect a partial one, I have proof she said that. Etsy doesn’t care nor do they care it took 7 months or that Christmas guarantee wasn’t honored.

5,2023-03-19 22:51:00,"Etsy is a great company and their app does what it should! It anticipates my needs, doesn’t over prompt but knows my tastes so shopping is easier. The communication is excellent. It’s like a more trustworthy eBay with class. I’ve made many purchases here in my effort to shop more directly with little ma-n-pa style stores. That and eBay deleted my account when I hadn’t shopped in a couple years… so I tried ETSY and I love it! I shop here more than any other place online and my experiences have largely been awesome! Occasionally shipping takes longer, but at least I know I’m not feeding a sweat shop shipping warehouse… shipping on ETSY just feels good and you meet people all over that are willing to share their talents directly without a bunch of middle people. Then ETSY adds a layer of security so you know your buying from someone they took time to ID. There are other apps out there, but ETSY is my favorite.",One of my favorite ways to shop

I recently have tried to sell by making a different account but it won’t let me make a new one. I have emailed them again and they told me that I had “violated” the community guidelines because I had apparently sold something that I had not made. WHAT?!! So you tell me I can get my account back in June and then in June you tell me I cannot get it back ever or make new accounts? I sell slime!! MY slime!

I took special care to water and give them morninglight and grew gorgeous plants, repotting as they grew… just as I have always done for my lovely Thanksgiving and Christmas cactus!!!! As Easter was approaching no buds!!! Still no buds!!! Imagine my disappointment after a year of waiting and caring for the plants! They are wonderful but no blooms! Now tell me why! I will add that when the starts arrived there were no instructions or labels identifying what the colors were. That was ok because I knew I would be happy whatever color and I’d label them as they bloomed. But they didn’t bloom! Very disappointed!!!! Any suggestions would be very helpful!!! Or my money back!

I really like the keep my favorites pages organized and right now I’m so frustrated I don’t even want to get on the app. The items show up duplicated either next to each other or as I scroll. If I try to “unheart” an item that has sold to remove it from my favorites page, the whole page scrolls me back to the top of my list (super frustrating when trying to organize hundreds of favorites to have on hand for social media).

5,2023-05-10 00:32:48,"I have been using Etsy for around two to three years now, and have had virtually no problem(s) with it. Easy to work with, generally, and you can find lots of cool stuff. Some of my favorite things I’ve purchased have come from this app. Generally, shops and those who run them are nice. I also find this fun to use (but that’s just me.)     Just like any other on-line marketing platform, though, I’d say use caution. Check shop reviews before buying. But if something really catches your eye and it’s from one that hasn’t been rated or reviewed yet, well, there’s nothing wrong with that (necessarily!) Everyone has to start somewhere, right? Anyways, back to my point.     I’ve bought a motorcycle jacket from a shop on here, and the seller was kind enough to send me a message (shipping from U.K. to U.S.) to let me know it was Easter holiday there. She did as she said and shipped it out as soon as it was over, and was even kind enough to include a thank-you card for the purchase! (Some shops will send you little things like that as extras.)     Communication is also important — especially if, or when, there is an issue. But over-all, it’s a safe, fun, and easy-to-use app! Very awesome. I’ve never regretted anything I’ve bought off of here, and I hope I don’t in the future. I love it so much. Oh — turning on notifications often helps (tracking packages, etc.)",Etsy App Review

HOWEVER, the iOS Etsy app is turning into a nightmare. Notifications for sales on items I’ve favorited on two separate pages (updates and deals)? Why? I have to repeatedly toggle the pages to make the app badge go away. Forcing reviews to make a badge go away is also annoying… and faulty. Last week I reviewed an item I purchased and the badge is STILL on the app despite deleting and redownloading the app. When I click the review button in the app, the screen pops up for “nothing to review here!” The repetitive notifications and faulty badges are irksome. I’ve also had the problem some other reviewers mentioned where items remain in your cart despite checking out with Apple Pay. Also, what happened to categories? I liked browsing that way.   This app has gotten worse, not better. It makes me avoid shopping on Etsy because the app is so annoying.",The notification nightmare
1,2022-08-02 23:19:37,"This truly awful app has given me literally hours of consternation.  Try researching anything in a browser to actually write a factual message to a seller and you will absolutely want to scream in frustration.  Each time you switch to another app, even the built-in spotlight app, everything you have written no matter how brief or long just vanishes.  Let that sink in for a moment.  This app has a messaging section that won’t let you switch outside of the app for any reason without making you pull your hair out in rage.  Did a call come in before you completed your last sentence?  Oops!  If the iPad fell asleep, you’re perfectly researched message that you were down to just proofreading before sending is now gone.  Pop up notice for something important?  Well, you get the picture.  The only way to avoid this pitfall is to select all and copy so that when you come back you can *start all over* and have a little head start by pasting, but if you didn’t think to do that (not intuitive) you may just resign yourself to saying, “I didn’t want that product anyway” and just walk away.",Wonderful marketplace; horrifying app

Sometimes I want to purchase several items from the same seller, and I either have to click on actual item to see who the seller is or go to the seller's store to see which items I've favorites.  How cluzy is that??  Another (huge) issue is the favorite lists.  You click on an item to favorite it; it goes in a generic favorite list. Then you add it to whatever special category list you have created.  All OK, and good, except when said item is sold or is no longer available.  I like to keep my lists current and cleaned up so they aren't too long and unwieldy.  However..this is where it gets tricky.  Etsy grayscales items no longer available and the price isn't listed anymore on the thumbnail pic.  In order to delete it, you have to click on heart and then click on whatever lists item is in (quickly, because it goes away) and then list scrolls back to the friggin TOP of the favorites page you were looking at!!!

4,2020-12-13 00:56:58,"I have been using Etsy for many many years. I really miss the Treasury feature, and the ability to make themed scrap-book like shopping lists to encourage others to buy items they may not have seen before. It was great for sellers, as it was free advertising- but it was also good for treasury creators because often the sellers would provide them discounts for it... I also think Etsy could be an entire social system with chat rooms, craft classes, live feeds from Etsy shops, giveaways, ect... Etsy has always been the favorite spot for real artists, not fakes or mass marketed cheap stuff. I do think its been getting a bit worse about that, you have to sift through a lot of hustlers, but the great artists and crafters make it worth it. I also think that Etsy should create some rules for sellers to help with customer service. Sometimes you ask questions and sellers won’t even respond, or they are rude.

I often add things to my checkout from from multiple sellers at once, but I like to make my purchases from the different sellers individually. It makes more sense, since they all charge for shipping separately and many have different shipping times. The concept of merging all the purchases together is a good one, if that is how you prefer to pay, but it’s not good for everyone.   On the web version, you can choose to check out from different shops individually, so I find I do my “window shopping” and adding stuff to my cart from my phone but then making my actual purchases from a computer. It’s a little inconvenient that way. It would be nice if the phone version offered the “check out from this shop” feature, or allow you to select the old checkout style.",New checkout has one problem...

The last three items that I have purchased off of Etsy, that claim to be handmade products, turned out just be outsourced. I typically am not a complainer, but I ordered a sweatshirt and tried to contact the seller and come to find out the sweatshirt did not come from the seller. I then ordered a handmade stitched animals and feel completely duped as what I received was clearly a knock off. The seller is clearly using other artists photos and sending reproductions that nowhere match the original quality. Lastly, I ordered a mask. What came in the mail was a completely different product. I reached out to the seller. He said there’s nothing they could do about it. The website clearly makes it look like he is making these masks and it became clear that they are out sourcing.

What makes this even worse is that if I navigate away from my PDF file on safari and then come back only a short time later, it almost always “loses” the page and it says it cannot be found, so I have to go through the entire process again just to use my PDF files which I paid for.

Another example is that I sold two items I had listed on Etsy to my coworker. She wanted to support me and leave me a good review. Instead of paying for shipping which is stupid, I handed her the package at work and hit the option when I “shipped” it as “other” for the method. The problem now is that Etsy took my stupid badge away because I didn’t provide tracking information for these two sales. Because I hand delivered it.

1,2019-08-12 01:28:32,"I have been shopping on Etsy for quite a while now and there is one seller in particular which I like buying things from her work is amazing and beautiful and she post items as she finishes them. With that being said her items are also very popular so once her items are posted you instantly have to try and purchase it or it’s gone, but it is hard to do that when her shop has multiple items up for sale, and you can’t see any of them. Within seconds those few items she listed are sold. With not being able to see what was sold. Unfortunately every single time I get on there and she post three or four items at once and you go to refresh the page to see the items that were posted there’s nowhere to refresh there’s no refresh button you cannot slide the screen down to refresh I don’t understand this issue, please fix it!!!

5,2022-08-10 00:43:25,"So I’m relatively new to shopping on this app. I like the idea of “supporting small businesses”. However the pricing is strange, and the shipping. Usually when I order things online I’m able to see what I paid for it and the estimated delivery date. On Etsy it gives me like 5 sections of pricing and a “discount” that I hadn’t even realized I received until after I bought it. The tracking also confuses me. It’s extremely vague. The constant sales that doesn’t seem to ever affect the original price. As in the general stand point, it’s very nice. In the details it’s hard to pinpoint details of your package. To a reader that is glancing over reviews, this probably doesn’t make much sense.  However I would definitely review the individual seller before I buy anything. I will most likely buy from Etsy again, depending on my orders. Try for yourself! 💕","I really love the idea, but"
4,2022-12-23 21:30:22,"I like Etsy and think it’s great way to let entrepreneurs sell what they want on a sleek and simple app that makes it easy to shop, however one thing that been bothering me and many others is that there isn’t a clear and concise way for shoppers to block shops or items from the front page that they don’t want to see, like how there was one time when I opened up the app to see what were in my recommendations as usual when I was met by semi-lewd furry art that was definitely something I wouldn’t want other people seeing if they accidentally stumbled upon my Etsy tab. What I think would be helpful is if there was an option underneath the report item button that said “not interested” or something like that,then people would be able to keep unwanted items from creeping in to their recommendations. I hope Etsy takes this to heart and implements something like that soon.",Good except for one thing

Unique, one-of-a-kind delights at prices that seem like a dream-fantasy. That’s what you’ll find here. From all over the world! Literally. And if you don’t find it, someone will make it for you.

My other apps do not crash or have a similar pattern in any way.   I clearly still use it, despite this.  Would recommend to anyone.

I was going to buy a $0.75 item, and the cost of shipping was $3.99, I couldn't justify paying that much money, I was bummed because I really liked the item. Etsy has SO many sellers and people making often costly purchases..the high cost of shipping for many, many shops is often the dealbtraker for me and ill decide against making that/those purchases.

The Etsy app is another story, particularly the so called “search” function. It’s even less useful than Amazon’s, rarely returning what you are searching for, instead offering up all sorts of sponsored items or products it believes you would like instead. I have better results searching on Google for Etsy shop items. Too bad for Etsy, though, because while this results in me finding what I was looking for I often find it for less money from an alternate source. “Favorite” function is glitchy, too. One cannot remove it if item is sold out. Cart functionality is also problematic, “save for later” function doesn’t always work especially if you try to remove the item. Finally Etsy, you sincerely need to find another way of reporting copyright infringement (if you are not the copyright owner). It is rampant on your site.",PLEASE: Improve the search function!
1,2022-08-16 18:03:09,Beware of sellers that claim to have hand made items and to called star sellers. There must be a way they can put fake reviews or delete bad reviews like on google.  I’ve had two sellers in the last 4 weeks sell an item that didn’t AT ALL look like the photo. When I kindly reported this to them by email they both attacked me and one of them makes me nervous that he knows my address.   Etsy did not at all address this guy and how adamant he attacked me and did not address the issue. Etsy simply said they couldn’t do anything because I received the item (which was the wrong item) and closed the case in his favor. But what about his unprofessionalism? If you use Etsy only purchase from sellers in the states. I spent a lot of money with Etsy this summer and never had a problem with a seller in the states. But I’m so shook by this seller and what a creep he was that I cancelled my account. To know someone like that has my address is frightening. Like other reviewers say so many of these sellers are making untrue claims about their products and Etsy does NOT protect the buyer.,Corrupt sellers

This is extremely annoying and means essentially that I’ll have to either delete all favorites (which I use to make future purchases easier) or turn off notifications completely (which makes it difficult to communicate with sellers when potentially buying their stuff.) Both of these outcomes mean me using Etsy as little as possible because other platforms don’t have these problems. I don’t understand why companies think it pays off to disrespect customers’ choices around notifications… spamming people doesn’t make them want to support you.

There is no real way to edit your lists. There is no seamless way to mass delete items, you have to do it one by one and if the item is sold out or delisted, you have to go into the app, find the item then select edit lists and scroll to deselect the list in order to delete it. Etsy should take a few pages from Pinterest who have made using their site and editing your boards very user friendly. Etsy also automatically adds everything to your favorites first, then you have to click the heart again to deselect it and then a THIRD time just to add the item to the list you actually want it in.

On top of Etsy increasing their percentage cut from seller they have also been holding various percentages of many sellers profits in reserves resulting in sellers not getting their profits right away as they deserve. Which has resulted in many being unable to afford bills like rent, food, utilities, etc. This is a grotesque misconduct of how sellers should be treated from this company. Many can't even get a hold of customer service as it's just an AI bot.

My mother was boxing up things to give to charity and asked me if I wanted to give my Tiny Tears to a poor little girl that didn’t have any dolls. I loved my Tiny Tears, she was my favorite doll but my heart was broken thinking that a little girl did not have a doll. I dressed her up to make her look pretty, and I was sad, but I placed her in the box for the poor little girl. Mom asked me a week later where my Tiny Tears was and I told her that I put Tiny Tears in the box for the poor little girl that didn’t have any dolls. At the age of 3, I sacrificed my beloved Tiny Tears  doll to make another little girl happy. Although I am 67 years old, I have always missed my doll and I still get emotional about it.  I am hoping my purchase will help me feel that Tiny Tears has come home.",Tiny Tears

However, if the product is not what was advertised then you best believe buyers will leave honest reviews with pictures as proof to prevent another buyer making the same mistake of ordering AND Etsy will assist in gain your money back.  Soo many talented creators that their pieces are one of a kind, which makes finding an item you thought only you envisioned or surprised when you stumble on an item you didn’t know could exist, was imagined and created for purchase.  Lastly, the endless options will guarantee you’ll find THE item you were looking for or an item you didn’t know you needed; even if you didn’t need it haha.","Quality, Uniqueness & Options Galore"

I’ve found a few shops that I like and have dealt with consistently because of the great quality and awesome customer service. It’s also easy to start one’s own shop (as I tried to do years ago but to no avail). My engagement ring came from DiamondsMine Shop and it was so exceptional in every way, from ordering to the box it was shipped in was incredible. Silvertolia Shop has been another of my favorites with high quality silver and gem stone rings.

The app doesn’t open where I left off, seems to loose history of last couple items visited, so if I don’t remember exact item or shop, sometimes I don’t find what I was looking at again.

I said all of that to say this could Etsy somehow make the customers aware of what OUS venders that don’t ship to the US at least that way you don’t bother to browse that venders site since there is no hope of getting an item that you really like shipped to you.

The stitching of the personalization looks really good and is turquoise and shows up so well on the yellow patterned collar. It has a shiny metal buckle, and the collar is easy to care for. I like to hand wash it and allow it to air dry. I ordered the medium, and I am glad that I did because he is still growing and I can adjust it!!! I like that the collar is 1” too!!!

I even traveled and shopped but I was always wanting for artistry which was difficult to find. I’d travel to local shops but even then they could only stock a few artists at a time. Now I can’t stop buying things on Etsy and I have found so many artists that make me feel like I can truly express myself by wearing their art. When Etsy was younger I sold things and they just kept making their platform easier to use. I love seeing buyers pictures and comments and the option for sellers to be able to comment back.

I feel bad because some buyer think it’s the sellers who keep asking, but the sellers have no control over it either. I have an orange 7 over my app that keeps telling me I have 7 reviews to leave, but when I open the app it says I have no products to review. If you buy anything, you will be asked over and over and OVER to review the products. I don’t like leaving bad reviews especially if a products was fine, but just not what I was looking or hoping for. Leaving average reviews doesn’t help anyone. Stop pushing for buyers to leave reviews all together. It’s become almost a requirement, to make the harassment stop! I turned off all my push notifications and still couldn’t get that orange 7 to go away.

If I search for blue socks, please just show me blue socks, not everything blue and all socks. Just blue socks. The reviews are now listed above the item description. I want to know about the item before I read reviews (these reviews are not for the item I’m viewing most of the time).

First, there’s no # to call and talk to a real person. The # that you can google and call just is a recorded message telling you to check their help page. Someone gained access to my Etsy account and changed the email address associated with it and so I can no longer access my account. Not only that but this seems like they were able to get access to my other info as well. There is no “help” page to fix this. Once I was able to “chat” with someone they said that they would look into it and have someone email me back.  No response. So now 3 weeks later I sent a form email back on their contact page asking for help and all I’ve received is a form email telling me to check their “help” page.

The seller had a misunderstanding and the curtains came in twice as wide as they were supposed to be—this means I paid twice as much as I should have and she ordered twice as much fabric (that she can’t return) as she needed. I wanted the curtains remade at the correct size and I felt like I deserved a refund for the fabric and labor that I never needed. The seller and I disagreed on who was at fault. I opened a case to try and get Etsy to weigh in. After almost 5 weeks, hours of emails and messages going back and forth, and 8 phone calls, I’m giving up. I’m super frustrated and disappointed with how they handled this. They never weighed in and read my correspondence with the seller like I asked. In the end, the seller and I ended up working something out on our own.

As someone who mainly used Etsy to find unique handmade jewelry, the app now seems to push droppshipped jewelry thats gonna fall apart and turn your finger green. You have to scroll forever and it is like finding a needle in a haystack to actually find something handmade which was like … the whole point of Etsy?  If you are actually able to buy something you like, the review/ purchases section of the app has become so broken. You used to be able to leave a review for items when the tracking notified the item as delivered or certain amount of time passed after you purchased it ( usually like 2-3 weeks if i remember correctly). This has become broken and I have been unable to leave reviews on multiple purchases, since the tracking is broken and the 2-3 week window seems to have been removed.   I could go on also about how the notification system has become broken, but I will end it here as this is already all over the place. It feels like Etsy tried to fix something that was not broken, and it no longer feels like a place for small creators to thrive since it has become so difficult to browse and leave reviews you are better off looking on instagram for individual creator pages :/",app broken

1,2023-08-08 20:11:25,I hardly ever use Etsy and even less now because they are allowing the stores to push Chinese crap that they can buy in bulk from Alibaba and there are very few actual handcrafted handmade items. Most of what you will be seeing is all made in China.   As for purchasing I have never been able to just purchase an item and there not be hoops to jump through. It's always glitching there's always an error and half the time I have to meet the seller outside of Etsy on another website. They do not treat the stores very well and they take a lot from the stores revenue. Etsy has become full of itself and full of Chinese crap. I just tried to purchase some handmade knives from a local person and tried four different cards and it would not let me check out. So that store lost $140 sale and I lost being able to buy the item.

I don’t like how I think I’m spending $40, but once I begin checking out, it’s actually $60. Nine times out of ten, I end up removing items from my cart because I wasn’t looking to spend as much. Having that information available before hand would be much more efficient and yes, convenient to the consumer. I also think the UI needs general work and update.

Try again in a bit.” The other problem was an automatic refresh issue that would frequently occur while searching through a list of items after running a search (the refresh frustratingly kept bringing me to the top of my results).

As far as I know, the only way I can filter search results for sellers in WA is by searching for an item, then navigating to the filter, then typing in “Washington” for the shop location.

I gave 4 stars because sometimes Etsy will over charge when it comes to shopping. $10 to ship something small is ridiculous! If I pay $10 I’m expecting to receive my items to have priority shipping. Usually the shop owners will lower the shipping cost to make it fair so it normally works out to the buyers advantage. Another draw back of having a shop on Etsy are their fees which from what I’ve been told by other shop owners are extremely expensive.

I think it would improve business because some things on Etsy aren’t affordable for all, and I think a LOT more people would buy stuff, if it was less expensive.

5,2021-06-15 17:24:58,"You may be able to go to E-bay or Mercari and get a good deal on a vintage item, but you most likely won’t get the service and quality that you get from an Etsy store. What I have noticed is that Etsy is more of a boutique and the shop owners are more specialized and knowledgeable.  I have had so many great experiences with the sellers on Etsy, who bend over backwards to answer any questions and are generally an artsy, fun loving group. Maybe it’s because the shop owners are just small business owners who care more than the big conglomerates. Maybe that’s because the Etsy management really supports their sellers.  I don’t know, but the experience of shopping on Etsy is just far nicer than other online vendors.  Viva La Etsy!! 😁",Etsy does what other selling sites don’t
2,2023-10-02 20:27:48,"I actually just deleted the app. When I saw what information was available on the app, that I was not aware of, it became a privacy concern. I will continue to purchase on the website on my desktop.  There are a few things that should be fixed. Despite viewing all the updates that come in from the sellers, it continually shows new updates with a little ball by the updates icon  when there aren’t any. It is annoying to keep clicking on it and see what you have just seen an hour ago and nothing is new. Certain purchases are still showing in transit and have been received a month ago. Not sure who is responsible for the update, but it’s not always working. The constant request for reviews and actually showing the number of items in a purchase is not necessary. I have seen people cut and paste on 20 items with the same review. The only good thing on the Etsy app is that you could just hit five stars and not have to sit there and literally type anything in when you’ve already done it.  It was disappointing to see the little videos, showing different sellers not be shown anymore. I actually looked forward to seeing those, but it was sad when they decided to discontinue that feature.

I don't want to see naked people when I'm shopping for quilt sewing patterns and I don't want to be bombarded by highly inappropriate pictures of people in very ugly lingerie that barely covers anything.

Also, this is for Etsy in general and not the app specifically, but the reviews on a product aren’t for that specific product, but for all the products sold by that seller.

I’ll add here though that looser regulations in recent years *have* meant some people are able to find loopholes and get their less than quality items listed — especially by stating it’s being shipped from one place in the US (so it will show up even when you select items only from the United States for example) when that’s the middle person and the item actually originates from somewhere overseas.

This is very annoying, especially since I favorited a lot of items for my wedding and now it is over. I do not need a lot of the items there are some I would like to keep in my list in case I decide to order them for gifts for anniversaries.

So much so that Etsy slapped a “don’t tell, just do it” marketing fee on our account. We didn’t need any help since we manage our own supply / demand chain and their practices was totally messing with our business plan. After contesting the excessive fees deducted from our account and that bad business practice, the only power we had was to leave the Etsy platform. We did as soon as we could. We’ve opened our own online shop through our website and have kept rocking without the bad business practices and excessive Etsy fees.

When adding/liking/saving an item, please make it to where we can customize/sort/filter our created groups by certain relevances. 2. create a way for us, as users on the mobile app, to have the ability to search for items we have saved in the past on our profile.

Add ability to filter for condition New vs Pre Owned. There are thousands of new items or crafts that are put in the vintage category somehow.  2. Add the ability to search in Title only.

2,2023-07-04 18:06:00,"The app works fine but its really not worth getting when you can just use the online website. On the app it is really hard to explore new things when recommendations from what you have already favorited are constantly shoved in your face. Also, the website is easier to navigate and look at other people's collections. Again, it works fine, but is not great, use web version instead.  Two other things:  1- There are way too many of those fakey-looking copy shops that have the SAME EXACT picture of an item with different price and/or watermark on the picture. It's ridiculous! Are there no sort of regulations with that kind of thing? And most of these scam-like shops are from Asia. It would be great if we could support legitimate shops from Asia not these copy paste scam ones. 2- Why in the world can we not clear notifications? Especially after you buy something the notification to review the item WILL NOT go away until you make a review. Yes I want to make reviews, but let me do it in my own time instead of barraging me with notifications.  One thing I would like to see added is being able to make a wishlist that is NOT for a wedding.

This shop appears to be closed.” So the only thing I could tap on is only the Go Back button only. I just want to unfavorite those specific shops because I know for sure those shops are closed down and it is still there. So I was wondering if it’s possible that you could install in the favorite section for the shops you could add some type of edit button or something to help remove them more easily instead of clicking on the shop itself.","Best Overall, just one minor issue..."

They got rid of the updates tab and put it within the favorites tab (along with random items picked for you). When you go to view updates, it shows old items from your favorite sellers. You have to then go to the sellers shop and sort by recently listed to see the new items. It’s annoying when certain items sell out quickly, I miss out on them because of this new broken system.

I never got a replacement. I never even found out where the package went despite the scammy facade of USPS’s case filing process. Each time, USPS blatantly lied about delivering it or it being somehow undeliverable (despite the many other packages I’ve received at the same address without issue) & faced no repercussions for it.

5,2022-01-27 16:33:41,"There’s no way to block or report entire shops, and reporting items is very unhelpful as it only lets you report for things involving how an item is made or if it’s labeled properly but nothing to report an item for being inappropriate in general and I can’t even keep from seeing anything from a shop I don’t wanna see from showing up in searches or the “similar to” section if i happened to like something else from the same series the item is based on I hate going on and seeing a bunch of stuff I don’t like all because I wanted to save something completely unrelated that just HAPPENED to still be similar in some small way",Unsafe and annoying
1,2021-02-02 00:08:38,"Etsy is the best app for a buyer! There is a great selection of things to buy ,such as gaming items, art, jewelry, clothes and more. On top of that you “support” small business, well that’s what I thought before I started selling.  After buying hundreds of items from Etsy, I fell in love with the concept of selling. I soon started my own personal Etsy shop, ( this is when they start getting greedy) I soon got order after order. I thought I was making tons of money, until I saw I was in debt for them. I had 10 sells/completed orders (in 5 days), and $32 or so I thought ,I made a discovery  that they took all my money and left me  -7 dollars in debt. People might say “It’s because you have ads”, my ads were 1$. I didn’t have shipping fees, because I had a download a pdf order. I didn’t sign up to be a moneymaking machine for Etsy!

Most sellers are great to work with and products are professionally made, packaged and delivered.   I have, however, had issues on a couple occasions with adult content populating my feed. I have tried to report it, but it seems it is within Etsy’s terms and conditions. A lot of it could be considered pornographic. I find it doesn’t belong in such a marketplace. The odd thing is, one search where adult content comes up results in more and more of it. The only way I was able to get rid of it was searching more and more other things (non adult things). Many times the searches aren’t provocative, but somehow this content appears. Disgusting.",Etsy is great for crafters but beware of adult content
2,2019-10-24 00:15:46,"Nothing wrong with the functions of the app that I have come across. Or the results that pop up. When you want to look for something the search engine will find it or something close.   The layout is pretty boring to look at. And I’m not judging it altogether based on the look of it, but there’s no real “replay value” in other words there is nothing that keeps me from coming back to it. But that can be seen as good when you consider every app has something made to be addictive to get people hooked and this app has an appeal with no strings attached, because it’s plain.   The first thing I noticed is that it has no features or categories function. Big drawback. People usually look here because they are bored and want to find something. And that’s the keyword: find. Discover. Without a category function we have to KNOW what we’re looking for. It is slightly stressful because of it.   It doesn’t beat google searching for these things for example. It doesn’t beat Pinterest.   I would say this app is up to par with the ASOS, another shopping app, although less in a way because again there is no category function while ASOS does.   You can’t narrow down your searches and that’s what is killing this app and it gets a 2/5.",It’s a little plain. No sorting feature?
1,2018-04-11 12:57:42,I have never been so irritated over a company in my life. Its funny how you absolutely cannot contact etsy in any way over a problem because the app simply wont load for you to email them! I had a seller not ship both my items I purchased over two weeks ago when they had a processing time of 1-3 days and i emailed the seller asking when they would ship since they are for a bridal shower gift TOMORROW. Do i have them yet?? NO. Seller lied and never shipped when they said they were. But can i cancel my order? Of course not because Etsy is useless. All of the automated choices in the help center just bring you back to your purchases page! I will never purchase anything off Etsy again. And i am permanently closing my account. Correct your customer service and block sellers that aren't shipping (which by her reviews i now see is a COMMON issue) and maybe you would be half way decent. BEWARE OF SELLERS ON THIS APP.,Useless customer service!
5,2018-01-20 16:27:57,"This app works well.  I don’t think it is as refined as the web application,  but it is convenient to use with a phone or tablet.  They need to fix the persistent overlay of descriptive text over shipping charges in the mobile app. This occurs when reviewing the details of an item.    The shipping charges cannot be discerned until the item is added to the cart and the user navigates as though checking out.  This is a big time drain to add and remove items any number of times from the cart just to see this information.    Many sellers have excessive shipping costs over others for the same product or the charges as so excessive it isn’t worth purchasing the item.    As an avid online shopper, i want to see all fees prior to adding an item to the cart & i am accustomed to this ability in the full web Etsy app.   I have upgraded the app several times ‘for bugs’ but this has yet to be addressed.   Platform is iphone7.     I will see if the same issue lives on my ipad mini.  It also runs this app.  I just use my phone a lot because it is always with me.","I like it & use it, but there is one chronic bug..."

This is a place where personalization meets reality in every aspect you can think of! It is amazing- the things you can find and the quality of art/skill. These sellers can stop production at any time so it’s always nice knowing you have something one of a kind, made from someone in their home, with love, dedication/determination, and pride. I love knowing I’m buying an item from a real person and supporting someone’s dream, while quite literally finding something perfect, and exactly what I was looking for. It’s a win-win.

But one time I need support or any customer service I find out that like all corporations these days that customer support is non existent. These computer games they play to send you on a wild goose chase everywhere but to any simple assistance! No matter where they send you next its an obvious dodge to avoid actually talking to a customer. Their own app starts acting up and there’s no way to contact anyone. I can’t believe the hours I’ve wasted simply trying to alert them to a problem with their app. They are not only unwilling to give assistance but they reject any possible help whether they know they need it or not.

Also the new update where your essentially having a conversation with Chat GPT is seriously annoying. I think it should be a separate thing rather than the only way to search.

1,2023-09-28 06:03:38,I used to LOVE browsing and buying things from Etsy. I haven’t used it in a few months and went back to use it yesterday and the new search chat “assistant” feature or whatever they’re calling it is AWFUL. You can no longer just search something and immediately get results for everything on the site pertaining to your search. You now have to type what you want into an AI chat and it pops up a few seconds later with a few different categories related to the thing you searched. Example: if you search “sanrio” it’ll come back with “sanrio plush” “sanrio keychain” etc and you have to choose one category to browse instead of just being able to browse freely. It’s super frustrating and there is NO option to turn it off. Either get rid of the chat or make it so people who don’t want to use it aren’t being forced to.,change the search back 😠
1,2023-09-25 01:54:04,Update: it keeps getting better. Etsy sent me a link in this review to “get help”. The link literally goes to their customer service page… which I can’t actually use because I can’t log into my account. I filed a complaint with the BBB.  I have been trying for MONTHS to contact Customer Support. I was locked out of my account by Etsy. I had been trying to update my email address. I have explained it multiple times to different people but I keep getting redirected to the Customer Support link WHICH REQUIRES I LOG IN TO MY ACCOUNT TO ACTUALLY TALK TO A HUMAN!!!!!!! WHY IS THIS THE ONLY OPTION WHEN THEY DON’T ANSWER THE EMAILS. I have files I need to download in Etsy and can’t access them.

It’s one thing to seek it but to have it explicit where anyone can find it is not okay. Kids use this app. Do you want your kids finding this stuff by accident? I think there should be a warning or a way to filter out mature content. Kids should not be able to to even view it from the recommendations. This disgust me. This is not what I wanted today. All I wanted was to find a homemade journal. Instead I find porn listings. And I can’t even report it either because apparently it’s been going on for awhile and I am the last to now.

The package got lost in L.A. which wasn’t her fault but everything that followed is, because she promised to replace the item when it came back in stock, then decided AFTER my window to complain to Etsy closed not to replace it but to come up with some compromise that she thinks is “fair”, so I have no recourse because Etsy has removed all access to customer support for disabled people.

Nothing made it work. I then went to other shopping apps that I can search on and learned it wasn’t on my side since results came back quickly on WiFi and data, there is something wrong with how the app connects since the last update. Really upset about this since I wanted to use this app to buy from people who make their own things and personalize them instead of buying gifts from stores. Hopefully they’ll fix this issue, it has happened on more than one occasion in the past. I love the app when it works, but i can’t rate something that doesn’t work.",Lots of connection issues

I understand that you have different sellers but it could be a little more user friendly. I don’t know how to explain it...the cart seems to be too crowded if you purchase from more than one seller. It’s too much information that’s not clear and doesn’t stand out. Other than that I love Etsy!

I also love the idea that this is a site that gives people a chance to market their artistic products easily & worldwide.  The only problem I have is when I went to check out & realized I had made a mistake in the quantity of one of my items, there was no way to change the quantity.

If I hold down on an item it should have an option to “Hide this shop” or “hide this item” if I wanna change it then let me change it or have a “hidden shop/items” tab on my profile.  Another thing, sometimes when I’m favoriting an item, I have quite a few favorites but if there is a type I don’t remember it should tell me if there is one already made, if I make a favorite tab with the same name it should let me know I also wish I could search the names of my favorites folders. Whether it’s directly the same name or by keywords.   For instance, I had a tab already made for “art” and when I tried to change the name of one of my favorites it just said there was an error instead of telling me there is already a tab made or offering up a “did you mean…?

It hurts the sellers as well. This doesn’t make any sense. I did a quick google search and found out it’s only an iOS thing too. A lot of iOS users couldn’t find their old reviews and can’t see reviews either. The solution they said was to go into the store and see all of their reviews because they’re all there. But when I scrolled down, it stops quickly and cannot go any further. You can infinitely scroll down on a desktop though.

The seller contacted me and stated she would send my last item shortly as she was getting more in soon. I never received the item or my money. After trying to message the seller multiple times, it looked like the business shut down.  Etsy saw as I received it due to me ordering multiple items from the same seller.

In my case with my buyer, I knew I would lose, but the buyer was rude, harassing, and threatening, so I decided to fight even though I knew I would lose. I clearly presented my case with many facts and points backing it up, and the buyer made up a bunch of garbage that made no sense at all. If anyone had taken the time to read it, there is no way they could have in good faith sided with the buyer. As expected…they sided with the buyer.

I figured it was just a weird glitch that would fix itself but after a day of leaving it alone it still wouldn't allow me to purchase anything. I thought there must just be a problem with the app so I switched to the web platform and Etsy informed me that I had been banned and should have received an email explaining why. I looked through my email and hadn't received any such message so I tried to file an appeal and explain the situation but I just received an email saying I've been permanently banned without it explaining why. What is going on?? This is really frustrating. I loved buying from Etsy sellers. Customer service is a joke.,For some reason I’m supposedly banned. No reason given.

When I purchase items that are expensive, as many custom items are I shouldn’t have to shop 2 months before I need the item in order to receive it. After I’m refunded for the 3 Christmas presents I’ve purchased for family (in November) and still haven’t received I’m deleting this app. and never shopping on it again.

ALSO why is there no way to hide listings that you don’t care about? If I could do that I would honestly have way less of an issue with the algorithm thing.

I did see a similar shower curtain from a different vendor.    I assumed these items were his.  He assured me they were not.   But was willing to help me.   I’ve purchased one of his shower curtains.   Hopefully. I get the right one.   His was more than what I paid for.    Now I’m out of approximately $84.    This is crazy",3 SHOWER CURTAINS

For how heavily it is pushed at checkout, I thought it would have a more elaborate order tracking section. Etsy kept promoting that updates for shipping were available in the app. I can’t see anything for my most recent purchases under the Updates tab and the You tab only shows items you’ve favorited. It’s nice to have Etsy pulled up on an app, but I thought it would be more helpful with tracking orders- I currently have five separate orders from different sellers. Overall, I think the app offers the same information that’s available just by opening Etsy up in an internet browser.",Nice to have quick access to Etsy but
1,2021-11-11 21:55:40,This was my first time placing an order on Etsy. The app is great for searching for items that you are looking for. But that was it.  I placed an order from 2 different shops. Got an email confirmation. I went to look at my account in purchases. The shops were listed there but I couldn’t message the seller. I did contact both shops thru the Contact Shop button. One store responded & said they would issue a refund. No response from the other Shop. I was going to look at the shops to see if I wanted to add something else to my order. Got a message that said no listings for this shop. Same message on both shops. Researched on the internet & other people said Shop is Closed.  Remind you this was my First order that I placed & will be my Last. Do not recommend Etsy. Horrible experience. Now I’m left wondering if I will see a Refund or I just lost $200.,Closed shop
5,2023-06-07 00:57:25,This was the best experience! The seller was very helpful after I sent her a message about wanting this pattern but it stated SOLD. I had seen the pattern months ago and knew it was one that I needed. I didn’t order it at that time thinking I would come back later to order. I was disappointed in myself that I didn’t act on it and place the order from the first time I saw it. Let this be a warning to others that see a pattern or a item they love and put off buying till later. This lady contacted me back to tell me know I could order a paper pattern. I did so RIGHT AWAY!  My thanks and appreciate for her help. ❤️,Great Experience!

Shipping time was listed as 2-3 weeks but could be longer due to Covid. After 2-3 weeks had passed with no contact I e-mailed asking for an update. I received an automated email saying shipping times were running longer than expected 4-6 weeks. After 6 weeks passed I emailed about an update and they canceled my order! I really really wanted my fabric not my money back. I never asked for a refund or to cancel. All emails have just been some sort of computer generated message. I tried calling, no luck. Just more automated messages. I am not happy with any company that does not offer ANY kind of customer service.

First, we couldn’t meet with our regular craft circles, then their were supply issues and instability as far as work was concerned. So we were all being extremely cautious in our spending.   But ETSY served to brighten everyone’s day. Vendors were selling their items in kits, making projects more affordable.  Shop owners became friends and would share alternative ideas for everything from cross stitch floss to fabrics and even patterns.   ETSY is a great organized group of Vendors that are passionate about each of their specialties. I love the reviews and how easily you can resolve issues. Yes, we pay postage but it is a small price to pay for the unique items you have access to. I’m sure by now we have all woken from our creative slump. And more than ever, we have become loyal to ETSY. It’s certainly the first place I go to when I need new items.

And in both cases I ended up regretting giving them my business, needless to say I still haven’t gotten the items I purchased even tho I was charged.

1,2022-06-28 13:32:34,"Etsy used to be a remarkable app; unique oddities & handmade items. That being said, handmade objects can be a bit more pricey. In addition to the added expenses, Etsy has decided to charge a 6.5% fee on all sales in order to appease their rich investors. This will inevitably impact these small business owners as one greedy corporation decided enough wasn't enough. It's already hard to justify prices in the current economy, and now they'd have to charge more to make the same living? Etsy is simply at platform, like instagram or facebook, and all of the work is carried out by the sellers, therefore; Etsy is only ever profiting. I will never shop from this source again, so long as sellers are struggling to make a living. Do better, value the literal driving force of your company, and support small business. I'll be using any other platform from now on.",Value Your Sellers.
1,2021-08-16 20:03:03,Most of the time I’ve had a great experience with Etsy and the shops there. However once a shop steals your money it becomes clear that Etsy will protect the thieves and not the customers. I filled several cases within Etsy to get my money back and what happens is you jump through hoop after hoop. One department escalates you to the next. And that department escalates your to the next an so on. I guess that they are hoping that eventually you will go away. For me if you protect the thieves at every turn you are no different than they are. You will find some great things on Etsy but beware. Once you get ripped off that comfortable feeling goes away. No longer worth the hassle anymore. Make your own decisions. Maybe you don’t care if someone steals from you. I do! Done with Etsy until they get things straight.,Etsy doesn’t protect its customers
2,2020-07-04 15:28:49,"Etsy is not like other online purchasing platforms. They make it very difficult to amend or cancel an order after you click that purchase button (even immediately after). Etsy doesn’t get involved until after your supposed delivery date. So if you happen to purchase the wrong item and you don’t notice it until your email confirmation, there’s no option to cancel it even if it’s just a minute or two after your purchase. You basically are at the mercy of the seller. Or if the incorrect shipping address was entered? Sorry, Etsy doesn’t allow you to change the address even if the item hasn’t shipped yet. You’ll have to email the seller and hope they aren’t inundated with emails and can respond to you before the item ships. Etsy needs to up their customer service game.",Buyer beware

I’ve had the pleasure of purchasing some of the MOST UNIQUE & QUALITY merchandise you won’t find anywhere else. I’ve made many purchases from countries outside of the USA too with no problems. Etsy has endless varieties to choose from and some extremely skilled quality shops/sellers. As with anything it’s important to read reviews and know what you are purchasing and who you are purchasing from because some shops/sellers are not quality.,Great Shopping!

3,2022-04-11 23:27:42,"I came here to talk about the Etsy app itself (not a fan) and ended up feeling broken hearted after seeing so many negative reviews about the Etsy site and sellers.   Yes, Etsy is a large corporation, yes there are WAY too many resellers sneaking their shops in, yes there are unscrupulous people scamming innocent customers just as there are, it seems, no matter where you go.  But, PLEASE, let me assure you there are hundreds of thousands of artisan sellers who take pride in their work, value customer service and feedback, are willing to create custom pieces and who rely on your support of small business to make a living.  I’m deeply saddened by the difficulty in sifting through the obvious mass produced sellers to get to the true original, hand crafted items and I hope that Etsy will be more diligent about getting them removed and KEEPING them removed and return to its roots as a unique shopping destination, but until then, I continue to search for those true small businesses because they’re worth it…I have many purchases in my home that I treasure and I’ve even made some good friends.

And after the most recent update, cart takes forever to load. But the most frustrating thing is Etsy’s SEO. Etsy is so busy trying to show me the thing they think I want to buy, that I cannot ever find what I’m looking for. Often, I have to go to google to find the item, which is on Etsy. But if you search on Etsy, apparently they’ve decided the best thing is to just keep showing you stuff you’ve searched for in the past that they’re hoping you’ll buy even though you’re not looking for it now.

1,2022-01-22 17:55:27,I’ve got some great things from Etsy and most make very thoughtful gifts. But I’ve had experience with sellers being flaky and unresponsive. I bought a very expensive tailored gift. They were very helpful at first but the moment I put in my order they completely stopped replying. There are literally little to no repercussions for them acting this way especially for such expensive items. Because of Etsy giving sellers too much leeway they have this rule that sellers can choose whether or not to give refunds on their own terms that they can literally take advantage of this. It gives sellers a lot of room to scam buyers and I don’t doubt that sellers make fake accounts to give themselves good reviews. Etsy needs to fix this loophole for sellers and add a feature that enables a three way chat with sellers and buyers so that it protects both parties from scam and liars.,Sellers are flaky

Now it’s takes 30+ seconds for an AI program to give me commendation on a good search lol and then it proceeds to show me the things I’ve already liked and saved. Nothing new!

They respond 24 hrs later telling me NO as the product is shipped and gave me a shipping number. So I track it and funny enough it says “waiting for arrival!” This is not shipped you ONLY created a label but never sent it to the USPS! What a joke! So I can’t file a complaint or open a case until another 4 days! Customer support is no help at all. So if the seller decides to still send the product after I told her I want to cancel I will wait at my door day of delivery and tell postal service that I refuse this package and return it to sender!

The item I received didn’t look like the picture the seller had on their listing at all. I tried to get an exchange or refund and the seller refused. I opened an Etsy dispute and Etsy said that the differences weren’t significant enough to warrant a refund... say what?! Isn’t ANY difference enough of a reason? You go online and you buy something based on the pictures and you expect the item to look exactly like the picture. That’s how online shopping works. The seller doesn’t get to send whatever they want after the purchase. It needs to be exactly what is in their picture or you don’t have a happy customer.

I’m not appreciative of that type of deceit - whether they actually live in the US or not, I want my money going through US financial institutions! Thank goodness my bank denies any purchase outside the US so I catch them.   2. If a store closes or the owner stops selling after you’ve made your purchase, you can’t get your money refunded in any easy manner. When this has happened, all store owners will say is contact Etsy.

So something like that makes it aggravating when you want to look at the reviews on a specific item from the shop and can’t find one because they’re all for other products from the shop.

5,2022-12-12 20:48:14,First and foremost! The consistency from the sellers despite all the questions I had was AMAZING! Very professional and respectful from start to finish! They stepped up effortless even with my last minute changes without complaining. I would by far recommend them to everyone i know and a blind person because you will feel the warmth and sincerity in there heart’s and soul. I most definitely will be doing a lot more business with them. Sincerely a very happy customer thus far.

Over the past six months,  an app update has rendered the buyer comment section of the Item Review UI completely unreadable.  When prompted to “Tell us more about this order” writing review text brings up the iOS keyboard WHICH COVERS UP THE ENTIRE FEEDBACK WINDOW. I cannot review the text I’m writing and I cannot manipulate the UI to allow me to view the comment as written so far. If, for some reason, Etsy’s app objects to my choice of phrasing or determines it is not a quality comment I cannot tell because again the keyboard UI blocks the entire section.   As the app is currently, I cannot write reviews via the company designed platform for doing so.

The help page says to …visit the sellers store and select “report seller”… but I have not seen where on the site that can be done and there are no instructions on where to access a sellers store so that they can be reported. So a seller can do as they please to u. If you are ripped off, too bad. If they take your money and then cancel your order, too bad. Oh, and I contacted the app developer to get help, I got an email saying it was an unmonitored email address and to look on their help page. Sellers are king on Etsy, not the customer.

Say you bought hair products or creams of some sort. Essentially it’s like telling consumers their voice doesn’t matter. This seems like a tactic to reduce negative reviews, giving consumers more time means an increase risk of their response to a product.

Despite this being a violation of Etsy’s terms of service, Etsy doesn’t seem all that concerned with these breaches of ethics.

I forget to leave feedback for items purchased if I have to wait 5 days after receiving the item. My buyers have also made the same comments to me. Fewer feedbacks, can make the difference in a buyer choosing to purchase from you- which means Etsy makes less money too. I don’t understand the reasoning in a delay if someone is trying to leave a review. Positive or negative, a buyer should be able to leave an immediate review once thei4 item is received.",Change leaving feedback to the way it used to be

Made a $62 purchase and never got the email I reached out to seller four times with no response. There was no way to track the order as it was not showing in my purchase history but the payment DID go through my bank so I reached out to Etsy to cancel and they said there’s nothing they can do and told me to contact the seller. When I informed them the seller has not been responding they said there’s nothing they can do but sometimes it happens that money is spent and people never get their product or hear from seller but they try to avoid it.

1,2022-05-08 16:41:29,"The app used to be faster for leaving reviews because it doesn’t force you to leave a text minimum on the reviews. That being said, the app is now buggy as all get out since the last update. Every two reviews it starts saying I have no connection. I do, there’s not a thing wrong with my data or internet. It spools and spools. The website has now become annoying because of the “use the app!” Or “buy now! Almost sold out!” Pop ups (and no, it isn’t almost sold out). The website takes forever for reviews and forces a word count minimum, so the app is the only way to go. When it doesn’t work, it’s frustrating. People have complained, Etsy’s IT design team hasn’t listened. I’m sorry to the shops I can’t leave reviews for, but Etsy doesn’t care.",Terrible App

It’s completely aggravating and it’s widely known among buyers and sellers all over the world that this has been taking place for at least a year.

It is the Wild Wild West of internet selling. The sellers do not take care to accurately describe and photograph the vintage items: they have arrived damaged, wrong color, not as photographed, poor quality when made to seem better and charged as such. Factory produced items, namely t-shirts, come in grainy prints and the shop owners disappear to avoid accountability.

I Would not recommend buying anything without looking through the reviews first, you never know just how different what you buy is going to be from the image online.

I would buy even more if the app Favorites function was more user friendly. Every time I remove a heart I’m kicked back to the top of my very long list. It’s maddening and super hard to update.

Sometimes you can get cool amazing things on here and people will do good business with you. If something is broken, they replace it. But that’s not always the case so it’s a real gamble.

For example: I can’t change my profile name and the app lacks useful buttons like “back” arrows.

I was going back and forth with a seller about a custom piece. By the time we decided on it and agreed to move forward, he wasn’t able to see the image I had sent with dimensions because the app only shows the last few messages.

But I do not love their electronic communication. When you buy something from them, your inbox is flooded. Which can actually make it HARDER to track your purchase.  The biggest problem I have in buying from Etsy is the purchase history section of their website, which is a problem reflected in this app. Some of your purchases will make it into your history, and some won’t. Because of this, TRACKING a purchase can be tricky, since no listing, no tracking data. Since items are coming from all over the world, and can take a while to arrive, this can be a serious problem.  Developers of the app need to ensure a complete buying history, and easy tracking from a purchase.

It leads to a chaotic shopping experience, if anything goes amiss. Recently bought an item that was damaged, yet couldn’t see the original item, to see if the damage was present  in the listing photo. Yesterday, bought something and needed to check a detail and couldn’t see the original listing photo of the item, other than a less than 1” inch thumbnail photo of it, so fat out of luck. The lack of even rudimentary customer service, is vexing, and the difficulty of inputting a truly exclusionary search the way you can on eBay, drives me bonkers.",Great merchandise

You used to be able to click on an item and see individual reviews for that specific item. Now, reviews are only available in one place and there is no way to sort them out by listing item. I’m hesitant to buy now because I like seeing irl pictures before buying and for sellers with 100+ reviews, it does not make logical sense to sift through all photos to see if maybe there is a picture review of the thing you are attempting to buy. Please bring back individual item reviews.",Can no longer see individual item reviews

The checkout where everything in your cart from different sellers is totaled and you cannot get a total for one seller until you checkout is infuriating. I cannot imagine this aides the sellers either. Additionally, the new payment system according to one seller is so difficult that she could not sell me the artwork that I’d purchased from her and she even closed her shop because of it! However, Etsy is still bugging me to leave a review for a sale that was voided — go figure. I think their entire purchasing system needs pragmatic streamlining.","Love the merchandise, app not so much"

We then purchased some gender reveal items (for our new baby) from a seller, but NEVER RECEIVED the items. We reached out to the seller and Etsy, both did not help help us at all. They had no empathy or level of customer service whatsoever. They both said our items were marked delivered so they can’t help us.  We are thoroughly disappointed with Etsy now and do not have our items for our gender reveal party. Not to mention we lost out on the money we spent.

1,2020-12-29 20:56:34,"The idea is good and it is always good to buy from artists! However when Etsy began to allow people from India and China to sell on Etsy, they diluted the artist population on Etsy and it is difficult to tell who is lying about it being hand made. For a website who’s purpose is to sell artists’ work, that just seems like a money crazy decision that makes Etsy less genuine. Also the artists’ prices have to compete with those who are underselling machine made goods and labeling it handmade. Customer support is basic and it’s hard to get in contact with an actual employee. Also you know Etsy gift cards only work on some shops? The ones who only accept PayPal don’t accept gift cards.

There’s no way to adjust the app’s “picks for you”, or remove something from your viewing history that affects it. Half the time I’m afraid to click on a listing because I know it’s going to completely mess up my account. Other apps like eBay let you control your viewing history so it doesn’t affect your recommendations.   It’s especially a problem when searching for a one-time gift for someone else. Now the app is suggesting tons of content I have no interest in and I can’t change it.   Lastly, there’s noticeable glitches.

To be a 5 star platform, Etsy must create a platform that provides value to the consumer while providing a platform to sellers that makes it worth their while in terms of profit and inventory turns without burdening the consumer and sellers unfairly.",ETSY PRICES

It sincerely is better to message a store first to have that communication bond instead of just having a high instant gratification of demand bc you saw something that sparked your interest.   These businesses are creating and working hard behind the very few clicks a customer makes!!!   Having patience and high respect for these artistic real creators deserve the respect and level of communication that you would give if you were visiting their shop in person and taking a gander for the first time.

I believe this is due to being led to two separate confirmation pages.  Both times, only one of the purchases had my new address, the other had an old address listing.  I had to contact the sellers to cancel one of the purchases on each occasion, which isn’t a big issue, but I feel like this is bound to happen again.

2,2023-05-28 13:39:34,"I love what Etsy does, but I believe that one thing that the app is missing is the functionality of the homepage and the the inability to indicate that I’m not interested in something (so they’ll stop putting it on my homepage). If you accidentally click on something, the app now thinks you want that particular item/will show you tons of options based around that type of item. I wish there was an option for indicating that you’re not interested in it without “Reporting” it, as the item doesn’t need to be reported, I’m just trying to curate a homepage based around things that I’m actually interested in.",Option for Interest in Item

It’s an absolute trash of a search. Useless. If I searched one thing and didn’t buy it and start a new search, it should not show me results from the previous, completely unrelated search. Nor should it show me items I already favorited that are completely unrelated to this search. It’s so aggravating to navigate that the entire app ends up useless.

It just clogs up the search function and makes it less enjoyable to shop. The new home page also loses them a star. It’s just a full page of suggestions I didn’t ask for.

5,2020-05-05 09:10:16,I bought masks from 4 different sellers. Two shipped the masks and two rip people off. Etsy does nothing to those sellers. They don’t remove them when they get numerous complaints so they continue to rip others off. I had to file complaints about both with my credit card company. I have deleted my account and removed this app. I won’t deal with a company that doesn’t care if the merchants they use are stealing from people.,Terrible company
5,2023-07-19 17:46:22,I’m so confused on why so many people are complaining about shipping. Every store on Etsy is owned by a different individual. They charge their own shipping cost. If they offer free shipping it’s usually once you spend over a certain amount of money. If people took the time to actually look at each shop’s policies then they would know. But people just click and complain later and blame others because they are too lazy to read. Sheesh.,Shipping

And when going to the web URL on mobile, the site of course wants me to sign in in order to favorite the shop, rather than redirecting to the app or some sort of connection.

A few iterations I’d made:  1) ensure push notifications have an action. - often times, Etsy will send me notifications of items they think I’d like, but when it launches the app, nothing populates - just a black screen  2) postal service integrations for tracking packages? If that’s a thing.. it’d be great to not have to copy the tracking number, open a mobile browser, and paste the number into the tracker. Often times with custom made orders, creators will often set status to “shipped” as to avoid Etsy’s terms.

What people do and look up is their business but there should REALLY be a way to “dislike” or block things from showing up on accounts. I don’t want silicone molds that look like dicks or vaginas, bikinis that show an entire boob, or masks that have penises on them. That’s unnecessary!

3,2022-07-12 20:52:05,"I both buy and sell on Etsy, and while it is nice to have a place to find and sell art and handmade goods (if you have the patience to wade through all the resellers), there are some aspects which make the experience unnecessarily frustrating.   In addition to the proliferation of cheap, mass-produced swill drowning out actual small craftsmen and artists, paying for shipping is problematic. Placing an order for several items from the same shop (especially internationally) does not result in shipping being automatically combined (unless you are lucky enough to have a seller who offers free shipping), but it must be paid for individually and then the excess refunded by the seller on the honor system.  As a seller, I have searched for a way to offer combined shipping automatically but there is no option, so it's a design error on Etsy's part. Would be nice to see this fixed, from both sides of the aisle.",combined shipping is impossible

Once the item was safely returned, the seller refused to reimburse the international shipping. Now Etsy is refusing to help enforce the reimbursement (even though the seller guaranteed this in WRITING through ETSY’S case system) and the seller is free to continue selling on Etsy with zero repercussions.

On a side note, many of my favorite shops are leaving the platform due to changes in Etsy fees. Please re-evaluate feed on these small shops.

I placed all the orders through the app and paid using PayPal on the app. Nothing said there could be a problem from doing this and other platforms have no problem either.   When none of the orders arrived I contacted Etsy and they stated their policy clearly states I had to contact PayPal and open a case there. Etsy has no control over payments or the money taken from you. They throw their hands in the air and blame someone else. I like looking on the platform and would really like it if they could control the scams but they choose not to.   It is difficult to contact customer support. They are not very professional or polite before dropping you. I’m really pretty surprised and let down overall. This is supposed to be where artists come to sell their stuff but if Etsy doesn’t protect buyers at all how can I buy anything safely.

4,2022-07-25 01:16:04,I love Etsy but the worst part is that they will say an item is on sale and it would be just one size or one type of style. Not the entire shop. Example: I get notifications that an item I liked is on sale. I go to purchase item and instead of it being a sale on my size (womens xl) it would be a toddler onesie. I believe that is false advertising. There should be a way to “like” our individual style/size and only receive notifications of that particular item.,Great but…

This has been going on for months and Etsy support said it’s being worked on, but it clearly is not.

The “one” issue I have is that if I search something, anything in the results that I have already liked doesn’t appear unless I click on the item. Also, could we please please please have a way to search inside your favorites, that is also clearly marked, because if there is one, I haven’t found it.

The icing on the cake was when I decided to go to the website of a shop I liked to buy straight from them instead of through Etsy, and it took me to an 18+ site smack in my face. I’m so done. So.

2,2023-11-04 22:58:43,"I love shopping on Etsy. A big reason why is being able to see updates to the shops I follow and item price changes. I’m a loyal repeat customer to a lot of shops on here.  Etsy changed the “Updates” tab to “Deals” and moved the shop update notifications to a small link at the top of the “Favorites” tab recently and I really don’t care for the change. It’s overloaded the Favorites page and the “Deals” section is a convoluted mess.   Search results are also a chaotic nightmare thanks to things like “deals” for items I’m not even looking for.   This has resulted in me missing a lot of shop updates and, because I can’t find what I’m looking for quickly and easily now, I find I am making fewer purchases.   *PLEASE* go back to a less is more display and make it less jumbled. Screen space on a phone gets real jumbled real quick when an app is trying to do too much. Etsy’s app has become a prime example of this.","Great App, Terrible UI Changes"

Additionally it seems like the search feature as a whole got a major downgrade, as it appears to bring up less accurate items to what you’re searching for.

However the amount of times I’ve had to open a case and get a refund and never getting the product is starting to get out of hand. Etsy needs to do better with pushing forward the people who actually respond and give you their product as opposed to those that take your money and say it will ship soon when months go by and you still don’t get the product or an update. I really love the app and supporting people that do these kinds of things but I’m getting so frustrated because it’s not guaranteed you’ll get the product.,Be mindful of who you buy from
3,2020-08-25 22:02:44,"With everything going on it’s great that the announcement feature on stores is there so shop owners can let people know that there are likely shipping delays and XYZ, what’s NOT great is when you don’t see the announcements because on the app it’s located below all of the listed products, so if the shop has hundreds-thousands of products listed you’re going to be scrolling for awhile..

You just need to think about what they would like.  Instead of buying crap like clothes or something from Walmart. You can find some nice stuff that will be cheap and they would like.  For men. You can get some cool stuff on here as well. Like metal plated posters of your favorite car. Or something that is a physical bronze statue of a hot babe that would look cool and classy.

For one thing a couple months ago they did something with notifications that causes you to ALWAYS have a push notification for any update to a shop that comes along. I tried all types of in app notification combinations to make it go away and nothing. I eventually had to just completely turn off all Etsy notifications on my phone because it was killing my OCD tendencies.,Love the shops but buggy
1,2023-03-07 03:10:35,Scammer supposedly talked me into the motions of buying the item and receiving everything that came within the description. Tried getting a refund after I saw other people getting scammed and seller still insisted on me getting every item within the description. This was on march 5th. And today march 6th from my package I received a microphone and a bottle of lotion and not the Nintendo switch. You can’t even contact the app support team and suggest that you contact the seller. What are the odds of a seller responding to you after u got scammed and waiting 9 days later for the support team to try and fix it. Will not recommend using at all,Got scammed on this app!!!!

However, when the shipment notification comes through it is evident that the goods are shipping from China, and that is where the shop is located. As a consumer this violates the level of trust I have in Etsy to ensure my money goes towards small online businesses in the US.

One person who didn’t read the description properly can ruin them. Sellers end up making way less than minimum wage and are thrown under the bus and disregarded whenever a customer has a complaint.

This warning could only be read under the FAQ section of the Etsy website.  Why would I read your FAQs when all I want to do is simply purchase an iPhone wallpaper??

First time was when I was a new seller which was understandable and now it’s just unacceptable since I have done nothing wrong.

1,2021-08-14 00:24:52,This last update says it’s suppose to fix bugs but I think this update has a bug that actually needs to be fixed. Several times I tried to do the update and it would not complete. So I decided to delete the app and re-download  it which it will also not complete. And there doesn’t seem to be a good way to reach out to support to let them know about this because none of the options listed to select with what you need help with appears has nothing to do with the technical side of the app. Normally I’m very happy with using the Etsy app to shop but this is very frustrating.,Issues with this last app update

5,2021-02-21 02:39:02,Jenny Fiddle candles super high quality and smell divine. I had purchased a scent for my ailing mother (who is home bound in Oklahoma) that she absolutely loved. That scent had been discontinued. I wrote Jenny and told her how much my mom enjoyed that scent and how it brought memories of our times together. Jenny promptly replied with the promise to reprise that scent and that she did. I have already made an order to go straight to my mother’s.  Thank you Jenny for making it possible for my mom to have a “little bit of Nashville” in Oklahoma.,Above and Beyond
5,2020-12-09 17:43:14,Love Etsy- it allows me to be able to support small businesses all over the world! These shop owners pay such attention to detail and are so knowledgeable about their craft or business. When I message a shop owner they always get back to me right away and are happy to answer questions. I can’t say enough about Etsy. Anytime I need anything Etsy is where I to first. There is nothing you can’t find on Etsy!,Love
5,2020-06-15 22:50:00,"Every shop owner I’ve dealt with on Etsy has been so kind and welcoming. The products listed are often crafted with great care, which makes opening them such a pleasant experience! As for the app itself, it is easy to navigate and purchase items; prices are not hidden from the buyer and don’t end up being more than you’d expect. Overall a great app that I have received many fantastic items from. :)","Beautiful Products, Considerate Shop Owners!"
1,2020-12-09 03:29:02,"NEVER EVER ORDER CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FROM THSI SITE!!! We ordered two customized t-shirts, and we had them personalized to have names on the back. We also asked for them to be in Christmas packaging and wrap. When it came on our front porch, the packaging was summer themed and was nowhere near matching. The bow on it didn’t even match the wrap that it came in, and then one of our shirts was the wrong color. Also, neither of them had the personalizations that we paid for on there. There was also not a price on our stuff. Then, we asked for Christmas cards with the packaging and they weren’t even cards, they were pieces of paper, and the order was printed on the same piece of paper as the card🤦🏾‍♀️.

4,2018-09-29 14:36:47,"The App keeps updating, but it seems to get rid of many of the choices. Where are the things from people I follow? That is why I follow them because they look at far more interesting items than what Etsy wants me to look at. My feed stays the same with almost the same items week after week. I am tired of the same feeds and I have tended not to use the App as much.

5,2019-12-04 02:26:52,Etsy can be relied upon to provide quality merchandise that will not drain your bank account. I have shopped here for several years. Their products are not simply “off-the-rack” but often even one of a kind. Lately I have discovered African Prints. The pallet of gorgeous brilliant colors bring me joy whenever I wear them and compliments from friends.

In creating an account it automatically pressed done when I was creating my password. I had to reset the password later on. Also their transaction process is quirky as well. I tried using Paypal and it kept saying my card was not accepted. Which was a first since I use PayPal often. I had to put in my CC directly to their website. Needs some improvement overall. Needs to be more user friendly.,App is quirky and needs improvement

It takes so long to get anything from Etsy even if I purchase faster  or rush shipping (rush is extra/additional charge plus shipping.)Supposed shipping everywhere is delayed because of covid. I’ve ordered many things from other places and received within a few days of ordering with regular/standard mail so I know it’s not because of covid. Etsy shipping was terrible before covid. Also there have been 3 times immediately after purchasing from Etsy my bank account was hacked with fraud. 3 TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED. THERE IS A LEAK IN THE ETSY System.

The free shipping was previously easy to spot out with a grey box around it, and now it is just in green letters that don’t really contrast much making it more difficult to see.

Not having enough money to buy one of everything   The best part is that you’re supporting a small business, the bonus of a handcrafted, mostly one of a kind item makes it that much more special.   Just when you think you’ve seen it all...another unique item pops up in your suggestions. I have spent hours upon hours here staring and drooling at everything.

Nope, they then charged me 15% to cancel since it was such an inconvenience for them to make the product “from scratch to order” clearly not true since she also claimed the item was made during busy time.

If I buy it through the Etsy app, why can’t I access it through the app?? Further, the app checkout goes in and out of allowing me to full checkout. One moment I can checkout, another it’s a totally full black screen with an odd tiny white speck in the left corner. Don’t even know if this app is safe to buy things when the checkout is working.

I was worried and wondered if there was a way for me to communicate with them and was pleasantly surprised that they reached out and helped every step of the way. They also responded in a timely manner. Now the order is complete and I’m excited to see the finished product. Thanks for your assistance .,Anxious buyer
1,2022-05-06 18:19:10,Etsy does not vet enough sellers to prevent fraud! I have been ripped off too many times and Etsy does absolutely nothing to help you until the “sellers” delivery date (which they can change at any time) has past. I was ripped off 2 months ago and Etsy wouldn’t hear ANY of it! There’s no way to contact them. Too much risk. I’d rather purchase locally or post in my yardsale site for something I am looking for. That way I am in control of the agreement and interaction. Etsy isn’t worth it after so many fraud attempts and then not assisting until it’s convenient for them.,Too many rip off sellers
5,2022-02-26 18:08:30,I love being able to search for things that I have desired but never could afford.  Now I can pretty much afford those items I have always liked and wanted.

I would be great if you could update the searching capabilities and add the selling price to items that have sold.  Thank you.,Not user friendly!

Unfortunately, it is massively disappointing that Etsy is going the way of eBay, in that they over very little to no protection for buyers.   Etsy knows how they make their money: Seller fees. Because of this, there is no enforcing rules against sellers, and many sellers have become unbelievably slow in fulfilling orders. To be honest, it’s pretty impressive how lazy they have become. You really are rolling the dice when you order anything from Etsy that you need to have by a specific date.  There are numerous other issues, but they’re all along the same lines.

4,2020-01-06 16:35:09,It’s good and easy to use but I only gave it four stars. I enjoy discovering new stuff on Etsy but it only shows me things similar to what I’ve already bought (usually supplies). I loved the treasuries and discovered so many new things that people make that I wouldn’t even think to search for. But I do most of my ordering and communication with other sellers on the app so I’m glad I have it.  Cheers 👍🏽,App is good
5,2019-11-13 15:31:20,"So far.. my shopping experience has been terrific. I was hesitant to buy crafted goods being a crafter myself, however, I could not be happier and I’m so glad that Etsy was discovered because it’s a fantastic way to have very creative people sell their handmade items.

4,2019-11-14 20:54:44,"I wish Etsy would let you post a picture even if you don’t give a 5 star review. I think it’s particularly trusting when you purchase something that you like, but it isn’t quite as advertised so you don’t want to give them a five star but want other people to see the reason why (example. Shirt color was different than what was pictured online)",Picture reviews

1,2023-11-01 06:22:03,"The retargeting in search is extremely aggressive. If you click one shop or listing, that shop will completely take over the results for that term. Other shops will basically stop appearing. It makes it basically impossible to explore a variety of options. Example I searched “oil painting” and clicked one result. Now that is the only shop that appears if I search that term again. I would really love to see some other sellers, but they will not show them to me anymore.",Search results useless

This glitch leaves a phantom review notification that never goes away. I have experienced this glitch for months, hoping it would be fixed with a newer update. Alas, the forced review system only implemented a new constraint on the app which makes you type up five words when leaving a review.  Infuriating.",Review System

1,2023-10-02 03:17:51,The new search update for shoppers is terrible. It makes it take way too long for things to load in and it’s not user friendly. I was looking to see if there was any merch for a band called “with confidence” and etsy decided I was looking for band merch that will make me feel confident! Also the whole only showing like ten products before having to make it load more in is super frustrating. Nothing was wrong with how it was before. This update made me want to delete the app.,New Search Update
3,2023-09-29 21:04:45,I’ve loved this app until the recent update. When you search it puts it in as an AI conversation. It’s annoying and now actually takes longer for the results to come up since this new “chat” feature began. Sometimes it will also just say not available even though before the update I had no problems ever looking for what I needed.,New update
1,2023-09-28 00:45:09,"I usually like Etsy but it recently changed to an awful “AI” conversation-type search bar which is slow, inaccurate, shows fewer/worse options, and overall really frustrating.

Why the ai? why do i have to keep hitting ‘see more’ to see more than 10 results at a time with a useless chat taking up half the page?

1,2022-12-11 10:41:33,I got scammed by a seller on Etsy and tried to file a complaint and their solution was to contact the shop owner. Been there tried that and the shop owner won’t answer. Can I leave a bad review on the store? No because I never received my item. The seller has pushed back the ship date to MONTHS after the original order to prevent me from leaving a review and opening up a formal complaint and Etsy won’t do anything about it.

They said they would look into it and nothing since.  I had purchases and no way to check on them.  They do not respond to me at all now.  There is no phone number to call.  They only respond in emails.  They are horrible at customer service and they do not care to help you get your account back.  They are great at ignoring you.,My App was hacked
1,2022-01-28 20:15:28,I bought a PDF file and you can’t download it from the app. You have to go to your email. Well it didn’t make it to email. So now I have to go back and buy it again in the browser. Which is where I wanted to buy it in the first place but it opened it into the app even though I HIT CANCEL!!!! It has become so frustrating to buy things from Etsy because of the app I can’t even tell you. Please stop. Fix your website!!! Please??,Can’t download files from the app

The app often gets stuck and won’t respond to me touching the screen so I have to get out of the app and then reopen the app.  This can happen with every move I make on the app, which makes shopping near impossible.

Only once was I able to actual track down the item. It’s not the sellers fault so I’m stuck without the item and no refund. There is no way to contact Etsy to get this resolved or fixed!

4,2021-09-26 15:31:24,Love the app. Makes searching a little easier. Only downside I have noticed has been when customizing certain purchases that require a message to seller. I’ve had to leave the app and open my browser to complete a few purchases. Loss of a star for that,KC mom

I have had two shops take my money and I never received my items. Not only does Etsy make you do all the work of trying to contact the shops but once you have no luck Etsy then says sorry better try contacting your bank.,Poor customer service

5,2021-06-22 18:52:15,For the most part the app is pretty user friendly as a buy - not so much as a seller. Beware of sellers from India like RivanShantikJewelery.

1,2022-10-27 00:58:46,Etsy doesn’t seem to care that so many Chinese companies list mass produced items as handmade under numerous shop names. They even use identical photos which would seem to make it easy to weed out the fakes but they don’t do it. They also no longer support artists in anyway. Etsy has become a place for Chinese companies to steal artwork from actual artists.,Too many fake stores.

1,2022-03-04 10:25:48,Bad bad bad company… my first order did not arrive. There was not any clarity on why the shipment did not make. No transparency.  The issue is not with the shop I ordered from but from the utter complete regards to having a way to reach out to Etsy customer service.  It took me days to try to get to them. Finally I raised a dispute with the seller (even though he is not at fault) so they reach out to me.  To be fair Etsy refunded the amount immediately and from their own account and without taking it from the seller account.   I give them even zero star if it was available. Not reliable. Not worth the wait.,You are supposed to ship. At least do it right!
