Geometry Dash is a game where all you do is press one button to jump and go through portals to switch types of jumps. Each level by Robtop increases the difficulty so that you can get prepared for online levels. As through your first play through, do the Robtop levels first. If you want to do the demon levels also, be sure to collect the coins inside the levels. They are important since the coins are mostly achievement speciality so get the coins. After you are done with all of the robtop levels, you can finally and truly play Geometry Dash at it’s fullest. Mainly on the right side of the screen near the play button. Try doing a bit of the map packs in case you want more coins, or jump in to get some diamonds, orbs, and keys. They are 3 vital important things to guide your way through the game. The game it’s self is a campaign game based off of what you are achieving so please, save up both orbs and keys, diamonds stay permanent. This of course means you can unlock vaults and figure out the codes through simple yt videos. Overall, this game is extremely fun because of you’re always achieving stuff and building up your skill. This game is iconic for how much kids played it back in its early development days, so this holds a special place in my heart now that I’m older. Robtop, thank you for giving me the best childhood",Really good
5,2023-10-09 16:08:39,"Hello Rob-top,      I just wanted to say that this game is fantastic and I love this game. It is a classic and I have played for years.  Recently before what I have to say my friend and I were playing and I enjoy this game a lot, and I have no actual feedback for the actual game itself.  If you are seeing this there is an issue with the game on my phone not working. As soon as I try to open the game it crashes immediately and closes out of the game every time.  I’ve tried everything at this point and I almost check it everyday just to see if it’s still not working. I just thought that I would let you know about this issue because this happened as soon as I updated my iPhone to the new iOS 17 and it stopped working and the same thing happened with my friend. Also I researched a little online and it seems to be a universal issue; therefore not a coincidental issue because other people online were having the same issues as well. So clearly this is a huge issue at least for iOS users and I just thought that I would let you know about this so that you can fix it in the next coming update so that way when you update the game it also works. I am also reporting it to Apple as well because idk what the issue is exactly and I know that you guys haven’t updated this game in years and I don’t know if you’ll even see this but please if you do please fix this issue so the game can work before the next update.  Thank you.",Error
5,2020-08-12 16:38:48,"The developers probably won’t see this, but overall Geometry Dash is an amazing game.  There are normal levels that you can get in the free version, and the full version with levels like fingerdash, and deadlocked.  There are also many more.  My only complaint is that when you beat levels like clutterfunk and all of the free levels, clutterfunk and the other insane levels I feel like is hard to make the transition to the higher and supposed to be easier and harder levels.  Even if the are the level you are playing on isn’t even an insane level.  Like geometrical dominator and blast processing.  Those aren’t ranked as an insane but they are hard to complete when making the transition to clutterfunk to one of those 2 levels.   Also, electrodynamix should be rated a demon level.  Lastly, some of the coins should be a bit easier to get.  Ok, here is my last complaint for sure.  I really need orbs to get things from the shop, but the only couple ways to get orbs in a day is to open the chests or get farther on a level that ever before and get a high score.  I have already beaten all of the free levels and the daily levels to.  And I can’t even get close to complete if any of the new levels or the weekly levels.  The gauntlets are normally hard to complete and don’t give out that many orbs.  You should add a new and easier at to get orbs.  But overall, amazing game Robtop.",Geometry Dash
4,2023-07-04 21:26:58,"Geometry Dash us a great game, although way too difficult. And there are a lot of weird difficulty spikes and the levels difficulty ratings are all over the place. Base After Base is rated hard, but is so much easier then Dry Out, which is rated normal. And xStep is super easy compared to Clutterfunk. Move xStep down to harder difficulty please. xStep is just easy jumping, simple flying, and easy to time ring jumps. While Clutterfunk is all over the place. Constant mirror portals and extremely tight jumps between saw blades and spikes. And the mini sections are super difficult. And Theory Of Everything 1 is harder than Theory Of Everything 2 . And Geometrical Dominator deserves to be in the insane category. But aside from all that, all the levels are fun and original, aside from Can’t Let Go, which is practically a copy of Base After Base. The level editor is fun, but can be very frustrating to use. But the level editor is my favorite part. I just hate that I can’t just copy one of the main levels. See I want to turn Back On Track into an auto level, but I don’t have the time to replicate the level. I hate that it says my email is invalid when I try to make an account. I eventually made an account, but it still says I don’t have one, even though I made one. But aside from that list of things, everything else about the game is pretty much perfection.",Geometry Dash is fun.
5,2020-09-07 03:30:11,"Geometry Dash has been one of m favorite games for years, ever since my friend introduced it to me, and during those years of playing, I have found some things that you might want to know. First of all, when you play the level “Time Machine”, and press and hold while the level starts to you rapidly jump, you will find that you will jump up on top of the spike wall. I do not know if this was intended, or just a glitch. Second, the game says that the level “Can’t Let Go” and “Jumper” have significant differences in difficulty. I have downloaded Geometry Dash on multipledevices, and I have found that I take so much more attempts to complete “Can’t Let Go” than “Jumper”. I just got the mobile full version on this iPhone and I completed “Jumper” in only 3 attempts, and “Can’t Let Go” in 57. I think that they should switch places because “Can’t Let Go” is much harder than “Jumper”. And lastly, I find it quite upsetting when I found out that you can’t add music to a user-created Geometry Dash level from a new Newgrounds account because lots of people have been stealing music and using them in their levels. I made an awesome song in Splash and was hoping to use it in one of my levels, but I can’t because of this. I, and hundreds of other people are trustworthy and want to add their music to Geometry Dash. Even though I am disappointed about this, Geometry Dash still deserves 5 stars.",Some things to say
5,2020-01-19 05:42:46,"Hello! And here are some ideas for geometry dash 2.2! 1. reverse orbs: I believe that if you add reverse orbs into the game that would be awesome! The reverse orbs are orbs that make you go backwards! 2. Anti-reverse orbs: this is a orb that reverses the reverse orbs! 3. Air blocks: these are blocks that make you go up without hitting a jump pad or orb! If just pushes you up or down,left, and right! It just depends on the angle of the block! 4. Big portal: This is a portal that makes you bigger, and increases your jump height just like how when you become small your jump height decreases! 5. Multiplayer battles: this is a mode that you can choose in the main menu but you go up against 4 other online people and there is a wheel on all of the players screens that show 7 slots on the wheel and all of them have different parts of a level, example: the invisible spike jumps from Electrodinamix, the plane part from stereo madness, the orb jumps at the start of polargeist, etc. until all of them are gone and that sorts all of the parts of a custom level that you go through and try to get as much points as you can going through the level, and if you die then you are able to spectate the other players and the last one standing wins, but you can choose as much rounds as you want and the person with the most wins, win!  So yeah that was just some simple ideas for geometry dash 2.2!!! Bye now!",Ideas for 2.2!
4,2020-04-06 13:04:05,"I’ve been playing Geometry Dash for a very long time and I think that it is a pretty well-balanced game that is a lot of fun when you get used to the difficulty level.  Even though a lot of the gameplay seems difficult at first because when you die in game you have to restart the level from scratch, once you gat used to it, that kind of gameplay becomes very fun.  Geometry dash also has a kind of rhythm-based gameplay, because most of the levels will sync to the music being played in-game.  The level editor allows people to express their own artistic creativity and understanding of the game by making their own levels and submitting them to the online servers.  From there, other people who bought the full version of the game can play your levels and give you feedback on how to improve them.  There are no in-game purchases, and I think that that’s a good thing because it encourages players to get better at the game by not giving them a shortcut.  The only real problems with the game is that many people who have difficulty managing their anger will get very mad if and when they die in the game, the community can sometimes be a little toxic, and the developer, RobTop isn’t that transparent. Overall, it’s a fun, entertaining and well-rounded game that gets you more hooked the more that you play it.",A pretty good game
5,2022-06-12 00:58:12,"This game is super cool I love the gauntlets and the key room and the secret shops like potbor and scratch I love all the skins and love how many secrets there are like the key master his level and the other secrets. A few suggestions though if there is a level that is rated hard or higher and you beat the level first try you should be rewarded like a chest, diamonds, or orbs that spice the game up a lot. And I know RobTop may be proud of making 4.6 star game that has no in app purchases but I know a lot of people would like to buy orbs, or diamonds, or chests, etc. It will make you, RobTop more money and most possibly make people happier to be able to buy orbs and get the skins they want. But make the prices reasonable. Other than games like Fortnite like 2800 v bucks for $20 dollars so you can get what? 3 uncommon skins and 2 uncommon emotes pfff it’s a waste a money thank you for taking the time to read my review of course I gave the game 5 stars but there are some glitches for me like a press the screen a lot but sometimes the game does not think I jumped, killing me. And another glitch when you close the game to either load another app there is no music and that really annoys me. But other than that no bugs or glitches. I personally love the game, music, and levels. This game was definitely worth the $2 I spent!😁",Really fun⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,2020-03-30 12:30:24,"I just want to say how much I love this game and I also have some ideas for 2.2. #1: The Geometry Dash Cup. What this is is something you can access on the main menu. It is something that maybe if you make a multiplayer section maybe you could put this in here. It is about a competition of 2 or 3 levels that all players get to vote on. And the person who gets the best in all the levels wins. #2: More main levels. I think that if you are reading this you know what I mean. I mean that in the main levels, you should add a bit more so people like me, people who have completed all the current online levels, can have a new challenge. #3: More gauntlets. I think that you should add more gauntlets to GD because if you are up for a challenge, and you want a reward then you should play gauntlets and if you finish all of them, you should add more so you can have fun. #4: Lastly, I think you should add a custom story mode. Kind of like how you did the vaults, but I think that you should have a goal, to build the best level possible, and to do that maybe you should have to complete some online levels to unlock parts that you can add in level creator. If you are at the end, I want to say thank you for reading this. I know that this level is definitely 100% a 5 star game no matter how much it costs, it is totally worth it bye!",Ideas for 2.2!
5,2023-04-20 21:36:05,"The demon level “Clubstep” is challenging but the level is just a little bit too hard. So can you make some small changes to the level but not too much changes? That’s all I’m asking. But besides that, the game is challenging and awesome and has a nice beat to some of your levels and other player’s levels. The game can be easy, the game can be hard, but that’s the point of the game. Geometry Dash is made to give players challenges and obstacles to overcome and avoid. For you can play the starting levels from “Stereo Madness” all the way up to “Clubstep”. The game can have some levels made by PLAYERS! The awesome thing about Geometry Dash is that it gives players like me a tough challenge to complete. Take “craZy III”  for example. The level is made by DaveJT. The level is extreme demon mode and is almost impossible to beat! Well, almost impossible to beat for me. But besides that, I love the graphics and the design that you give the game. Having that much graphics in one game is INSANE!!! I bet pro players like Partition, Nexus, Dorami, Mulpan, and Funny love your game! I love your game too! Anyways, that’s all I have to say. And also, RobTop, if you’re reading this, I love you. Happy editing! P.S. please make 2.2 of Geometry Dash. I’ve been waiting for too long and it’s 2023.",AMAZING GAME!!!
5,2020-05-12 06:29:54,"Ok, let me get this straight, the reviews for this game average out at a 4.68 as of may 11th. That is incredible! Also, just because this game has some bugs in the editor and some older levels, doesn’t mean it’s a bad game! And for all my people out there who think the game is “too hard” need to listen. It’s not an easy game, I’ll give you that, but it’s not impossible! As of today I am a successful creator and member of the community with 47 demons and working with many great people to keep this game running! Now, listen, to all the haters, what is BAD about the game? Bugs? That’s it? Lazy creator? No! Robert is just trying to get the best experience for us players! He has been actively working on the 2.2 update for 3 years now! He is done adding and is working on bugs so we don’t hate it! So, want to tell me what is wrong with the game? No? Ok, cool. Stop hating guys! RobTop try’s to keep everyone happy! Even if it takes a few years! Also, if you can’t beat levels, learn to make them! Get in collabs, play with the community, get someone to verify the level! Have fun with us! So to conclude, this is the best mobile game to have fun, listen to beats, play with your friends, and do things to keep us happy! I love this game and hate nothing about it! Have a good day folks! I definitely recommend!",Best game to play on mobile!!!
5,2022-11-12 16:57:25,"There have been some network issues happening lately which I couldn’t fix… I played Geometry Dash on an iPhone SE 2nd gen and it worked almost flawlessly until network issues began to arise. I could still search for online levels but I couldn’t check anyone’s profile status because it wouldn’t load up… I couldn’t see my profile status either and to add on top of that, The bonus chests stopped working too. Gameplay was still flawless with perfect frame rates. I recently made a huge upgrade to my new iPhone 14 pro max just a few weeks ago and it works flawlessly with no network interruptions… I downloaded Geometry Dash and got everything set up but to my disappointment, The Frame rates were beginning to drop even in levels with not a lot of detail and block design… The chests still don’t work but profile statuses now load up but after several attempts… It gives me the option to refresh the profile page and after the 2nd or third attempt, It loads up. I am not sure why this has been happening. Especially on an iPhone that I literally payed $1200 for straight from the Apple Store, I shouldn’t be experiencing any frame rate drops or network interruptions.",Network and frame rate issues
5,2017-01-19 20:11:05,"Yes! 2.1 is here! The update is amazing, totally adding greatness to the game. I got a sneak peak from Geometry Dash World, yet the full version has even more content. I have been playing GD for over a year, and if you don't have it you NEED IT. I could write everything great about GD, but the reason I didn't give 5 stars was two reasons. See, when it updated I transferred around my GDW data to the full game, and started playing.  But I realized that it was taking longer to load some levels or pages, especially my profile page. That was no big deal, but the problem was that sometimes it wouldn't load at all! Often when I tried loading my profile page, it just said 'an error occurred, please try again later.' And sometimes when trying to load levels, example recent levels, after a while the loading sign would disappear and no levels would come up, just a blank screen... The other reason that only got 4 stars was that is you finished a level BEFORE 2.1, you wouldn't get the orbs (currency) for it. Maybe you could add a 'claim' button?  I know the pressure from the community was really stressful, and how all people did was ask. But it would be good to soon release a bug fix update for the above problems. Thanks!",2.1 AT LAST!
5,2023-10-22 11:25:17,Geometry Dash is definitely worth the money which isn’t even that much and if you are kid who has to beg your parents to buy it well it’s pretty easy to convince them since it’s family friendly (except for user interaction’s however this is parental controls I think) also having Geometry in the name helps. I think it’s so fun because beating a hard level is gratifying and once you heighten your skills you just keep getting better and playing harder levels. Or maybe you aren’t very good and want something new. The editor is amazing and unlike other games with an editor such as Mario Maker where you can sort of make levels like in the actual games but not really. However in Geometry Dash’s editor you can go beyond its original function to make amazing stuff. The mobile version is a bit harder to play but doesn’t have a bunch of stuff cut out like other mobile ports of games. If you aren’t sure if you like Geometry Dash you can try the free spinoffs. The Geometry Dash community also is pretty cool and has lots of history if you are into that. This review is right before the biggest update so in the future it will have like 3 times the content.,Great game
5,2020-07-06 04:06:50,"Fun, but also difficult. This game is very fun, but it is also very hard. There are levels of various difficulties, such as a level where you don’t have to tap, (called auto levels), all the way to levels that are pretty much impossible. There are 21 levels made by the developer, varying from an easy level, Stereo Madness, all the way to Deadlocked, a very difficult level.  However, there is more to the game than just these 21 levels. You can create your own levels using the same editor as the developer himself.  If your levels are good, they can get stars, and then people will earn stars, which are pretty much a thing that you get by beating levels.  Geometry Dash can be very rage inducing, but it is also very fun. It is advised that people with epilepsy avoid the game, as there can be flashing lights, in levels, especially in a trend called nine circles levels. This trend has almost died out, but these levels can still be played. Geometry dash is a skill based game, as you can only become good with practice. There are no ads nor in app purchases.  You will love it, and although it will probably seem very difficult at first, with a bit of practice, you will find your self having lots of fun.",Title
5,2019-01-27 21:06:49,"Geometry Dash is probably what I see as the pinnacle of mobile gaming, right up there with Clash of Clans or Clash Royale. This is game is infuriatingly fun- every level is based off skill. Sure, you may get lucky because you tapped on accident, saving you, but that’s still YOU doing the action. Sure, Geometry Dash is stupid hard, but that’s what makes it fun. Without that skill curve, this would be a bland game. The visuals are great and feel unique, and there is even a hidden shop where you can buy some community-made aesthetics. However, what makes this game outstanding is the music coupled with the gameplay. Each and every level is shaped around the song in the background, allowing you to even play some levels with your eyes closed, as long as you’re following along with the song. The music is out of this world, and got me into the electronic genre. The level creator is fun and easy to use (there are some more technical things for moving, changing colors, etc.) and allows you to play others’ levels as well. This community allows for unlimited replayability; there’s always another level to beat. I can’t stress this enough: download this if you want to have fun.",A Must-Have For Any Gamer
5,2019-04-27 00:36:26,"Don’t get me wrong. I love this game. It’s visually stunning, it’s a bit addictive (which is what RobTop would want isn’t it), and the community is extremely responsive and skilled. However, there is one thing I would change about the game and it is customization. I like how more icons and color variants have been continually added, but my problem is with the coloring. I think instead of choosing two colors that would color the icon in designated sections, there should be an option to a new screen that showed the chosen icon and all the colors at the bottom. Then you would choose a color and tap / click any enclosed section of the icon to color that section with the chosen color. Then you could swipe the icon to the left and it would show the currently chosen ship icon, and you can do the same thing with that, all the way to the spider icon, obviously not counting the trail and death effects. This idea kind of came from those games where you’re given a picture and some color pallet, and tapping an enclosed section colors it in a chosen color. All ideas aside, this game is amazing and you should never quit expanding it.",Recommended but could use some improvements
3,2017-03-27 23:06:12,"The ability to move around triggers is solely functional to 10 triggers. Hide player, Show player, touch, count, instant count, pickup, BG effect on, BG effect off, animate, and shake. All other triggers (fade effects, color changes, movement, and state changes not listed above) will not be affected by the move / rotate triggers and this cannot be countered with the follow trigger which makes making extreme effects levels comparable to serponge like a Mario bros world 1-1 exact replica impossible  from a creators viewpoint I find this incredibly annoying and the more of these limitations I find the less interested in the editor I get especially when these limitations are unexplained please fix as I am loosing interest in the editor (my main reason for playing) and I fear that soon this game will become boring and uninteresting and these limitations will not only loose my interest but also of your best as they will run out of ideas for mind blowing effects but that's just speculation but seriously I would like this to be fixed (p.s. The alpha pulse and move triggers were responsive to move commands in 2.0 toggle never has worked and spawn triggers I didn't use until 2.1 came out so I don't know if that ever moved from move triggers) I've been a player for almost 2 years now I'd like to keep this streak going",Move rotate and follow commands
3,2018-11-28 11:13:21,"I have been playing this game for 3 years and have become pretty good at it, I play all the new levels that come out online... however, that is exactly the biggest problem with the game. None of the new levels feel new anymore other than the way they look because there is no new gameplay or anything to make each level special. It has been almost 2 years since update 2.1 came out and when I started playing the game in August 2015 it was on update 1.9. There is not even a sneak preview of the 2.2 level yet and the developer is so tight lipped about progress on the update that I believe that RobTop has given up completely on GD and 2.2 will never come. If it ever does come out, it will be revolutionary; however, that’s is also the problem: updates are too revolutionary. The dev focuses so much on adding a million new things to the game at a time that he does not even perform maintenance for the game’s servers (leaderboards have been broken for over a year). I would much rather have smaller and more frequent updates than getting more and more content in each update  because it is getting increasingly difficult to have motivation to play this as the dev drags his feet with 2.2’s release with no date in sight. 3 stars because it is still remotely enjoyable.",Needs more content badly.
5,2020-05-25 06:12:25,"Really fantastic game although some changes can help a lot. First, RobTop needs a development team or at least someone to help with the creation of the game so updates don’t go by as slow. Also, elder moderators should be given the privilege to star rate levels themselves. There are many good levels that remain unrated and we wouldn’t have this problem if there were more people who can star rate levels instead of RobTop himself. Also there is an occasional bug where the editor freezes and all you can do is playtest. I need to exit the level and go back in to undo it. There also needs to be a reply feature so people can see who you are specifically replying to in the comments. Notifications would also be a good feature so you can know when your chests are ready or if you got a star rated level or when a creator you follow posts a level. There is also a bug on the vault monster or whatever it’s called. I got all three keys and nothing is going on and I’m very disappointed. There is also a bug with daily chests where it doesn’t let you open it. I still love this game and rate it 5 stars.",I love it
4,2020-07-31 17:25:55,"Look I love geometry dash and how well designed the game is and all the fun levels. Like I said awesome game but there is just 2 things. Now I know this game is like 4 years old and I know you guys are thinking what am I doing playing in 2020, but it’s fun trust me,so now let me tell u the two things. Well the first thing is I’m just playing casually and I get to some more harder parts and you have to tap faster and sometimes when I tap it doesn’t jump and it can be frustrating at times but I know you might not want to fix it but there are still some iPad players out there that still play your game and that probably happens to them too. So that’s one of the things please if you could fix that and the other thing I’m about to say it would be my favorite mobile game. Now the second thing I want to fix is that you know those orb things where they boost you up sometimes I just press it once and when I land back to the ground I automatically jumps for me and that could get me killed sometimes it’s very annoying but yeah those are basically the two small bugs that I would be appreciated so much but yeah rob top awesome game just wanted to let you know bye 👋.",Awesome game but just 2 things
5,2020-04-04 03:53:42,"This game is mostly a game of trial and error. That means that you are expected to fail again and again and again before you beat a level. On the hardest levels, it might take over 10,000 tries to beat them just one time!! However, if you are okay with trying to beat the same level for a long time, it is very fun and addictive. It has a simple control scheme that makes it one of those games that’s easy to pick up but hard to master. The main bulk of the game, though it is not advertised this way, is the online levels made by the community. There are only about 20 official levels available to play but there are millions online and they are usually just as good, if not better than the official ones. The only problem with the online features is the level comments, which sometimes contain colorful language. The good thing about that is that there are parental controls to hide comments if a kid is playing the game. Like I said, though, the game is not for everyone, and you will only enjoy it if you are okay with the somewhat repetitive experience of playing the same level over and over trying to perfect it.",Not for everyone...

I play on mobile and recently got a new phone and I want to save and load my data from my account from my old phone to my new one. Every time I try to save, it always says an error has occurred. This has been going on for maybe a year or 2 or so. I don’t know what to do next, I’ve already deleted my custom levels I don’t need and narrowed it down to just three. I also deleted old friends who I never talked to or left GD, deleted saved levels, deleted old messages to and from old friends and it still won’t save. I have been playing the game for well over 5 years though and have built up a lot of progress. I don’t know but I have a feeling it’s that, my 5 years progress is what’s keeping my account from saving and the fact that my phone is old. I also tried getting more iCloud storage but that hasn’t worked either. I don’t know what to do next so maybe you could help me?

5,2018-10-01 09:50:43,"This game has done so much for me. It all started off with my Dad’s girlfriend’s son 6 years ago. He showed me the Lite version and I was like meh. I tried it and beat the first level in a few attempts! I instantly fell in love and we played it every time I visited. Then one day I got the full version on my mom’s phone. Every opportunity I had I would play it. Then I got a phone, 5 years after i first saw this game. I started to seriously play and now I’m here! 11 Demons beaten and counting! Anyways, Robtop there are some things that I suggest. 1. Multiplayer You know the drill, multiple people, shows a ghost like figure of the others, first person to finish wins or a tie. But I think you should also make it to where every speed change stacks up and down so players don’t miss it somehow and get a disadvantage, unless your idea of multiplayer is multiple speed changes, “hit the good ones avoid the bad ones” type of stuff. If so, then go for it! If you do it the way I suggested, then make the stacked ones invisible. 2 Scale trigger. Let’s you scale objects and decide how long it takes.

In general this game is pretty good and hard even know some games you can get good in like 2 days but this game basically says no and it takes up approximately 1 year to get good unless you play 24/7 for like 3 days- 1 week or something but that’s besides the point but theres something really stupid in this game that should not exist and it’s with the stars and you might be saying “So your doing a review on one of the stupidest things in the game ever?” but this is really stupid still alright so lets say I’m new to the game and play for a little bit and get to  a insane and it gives 10 stars but if I search up BloodBath and it’s a extreme demon and it gives 10 stars now… STRAIGHT FLYING, ENDLESS ONLY ONE WAYS, MINI ZIGZAGS, AND WAY HARDER STUFF AND ONLY GETS 10 STARS?!! I COULD DO FINGERDASH OR HEXAGON FORCE AND WASTE LESS TIME!!! SO YOU GET LESS PRIZES FOR A HARDER THING AND THAT’S REALLY STUPID!!! EVEN KENOS HAS THE SAME EXACT THING BUT A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND ONLY GETS YOU 10 STARS!!!….. Please fix this and make it so kenos or any verified extreme demon at least gives 20+ stars thank you…",Bad star giving
5,2022-04-03 18:37:11,"It’s a beautifully difficult game with many diverse levels and great songs. Also, there are levels that range from incredibly easy to near impossible (those demon levels!) also I love how you can create levels, share them, and play levels that other people have made! It has about infinite playtime. And the icon kit is great too! And all the mechanics like gauntlets, shops, demon keys, shards, and vaults are amazing. But the map packs are dumb. Also I’m intrigued with whatever the story behind it all is… Can’t wait for 2.2! All of the cool things in the update are gonna be noice! I guess I’ll just have to wait for a few months to a few years (or at least that’s how long I’m guessing until it comes out) I’m trying to make some levels right now, one with a cool starlit night theme. I have a few ideas for 2.3 but PLEASE don’t delay 2.2 some of my ideas are A black bounce pad to put on the bottom of blocks, and teleporter orbs. Well, that’s about all, so to any people besides roptop reading this I hope you’ll agree! But if you’re reading this roptop than keep up the great work!👍 -Mooshmallo",Perfection
4,2021-10-23 13:50:58,"I love geometry dash, I’ve been playing it for years. The game has amazing concepts, making the best out of 2D geometrical shapes. I’ve always loved the thrill of beating a level and been motivated to beat it if I haven’t already done so. There is one conflict I’ve had recently. I’m not sure if this has only happened to me, which I hope so because I don’t want other people to have to have this bug. There seems to be a problem, where when I tap on the app to open it, it will open the application for about a couple of seconds and then close out right away. It’s is practically unplayable. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the game, but nothing seems to work. I’ve shut down and then turned on my phone, but still, nothing. I currently have an iPhone 8+ on IOS 15.0, and there are no current available updates that I need to download at the moment. This has been happening for a bit, I’m not exactly sure how long. I really love the game, but it’s hard to enjoy it when I can’t even play it. I hope you can fix the bug, unless it’s just a problem on my end. But overall great game.","Good game, but"
1,2022-09-25 05:22:07,"I can remember myself playing this game nearly 5ish years ago. it was so fun i every time i played it would open with no problem. I had recently thought about getting the game but didn’t realize it was money, so i had to put more thought into it. once i decided getting the game i was so excited because it had been a childhood game and i knew it would be fun to play again after so long. it had taken a while for the game to download, which is understandable because i don’t have a lot of storage. once the game downloaded i immediately clicked on it. once i clicked it, screen went black and kicked me out off the game. i didn’t think much of it so i clicked it again. i thought “maybe the game hadn’t been updated in a while so i gave it a break. after a little bit i tried again. it still didn’t work. now at this point, i know something is going on. so i do some research. it said that “people with home buttons can’t play Geometry Dash.” i was obviously upset when i heard that KNOWING that i spent MY money on it. i don’t care if it’s just 2 dollars, it’s MY money and if I want to buy something with it, I would expect it to work. so you either, fix the game so i can play it. or you can maybe refund my money because this is outrageous.",Absolutely disappointing. (would give zero stars if i could)
5,2020-10-16 04:10:50,"2.2 is taking Forever! I feel that's good and bad news. Good because that means there's gonna be LOADS of new stuff! Bad because people are getting impatient And are getting bored so they won't play it. But I'm gonna keep playing for a LONG time! Hope the update will be good! P.S Robtop has an account you can check out and he has a few levels.  EDIT: oh boy...made this review when I was 9...fun times. Anyway, can't wait for 2.2! Heard about all the big news that came out today and decided to come back to this review and say that robtop has really, REALLY done so much to this community, and he has given us everything we've wanted. 2.2 is truly a big step and if this was the final update for GD, I would totally be fine. 2.2 has either been a fun time making, or a painful time making, and if it's the ladder or both, than you can always take a break. Robtop, if you're reading this, thank you. From me and everyone else who has stuck with this community,  thank you so much. This entire journey has been amazing, and it has only begun. Peace out, and il see you in 2.2. ❤️",This Is an AMAZING game! But... -UPDATE: the chicken is on the table-
5,2018-11-02 17:41:23,"This is a game that will never die. I have played it all the way back since when it came out. I am one of the first few players. I originally started out with the Lite version but moved on two the full version and beta the full version with every single coin on all the levels. In fact today I beat my 15th demon level. It’s a very fun and challenging game and will make you cry but also will make you feel happy... in the end. It is and always will be my favorite game. I am Fabs GD, a Geometry Dash Youtuber (even though I’m not a good Youtuber lol) I have my own account and have lots of great friends and do build battles and stream demons. I’m trying my best to quickly go through the ranks and one day I hope I get a PC so I can play Geometry Dash on an even better scale. (Not saying this is trash, I love this app) Then I can start working my way to number 1. (And also hopefully beat my first extreme demon) Thank you Robtop for making this beautiful game that everyone hates and loves at the same time. I want to be your friend on GD but I’m sure you get so much spam and your list is probably full. Again, thank you. :D #Fivestarrating!",My Favorite Game
5,2023-02-01 20:09:56,"Technically we have gotten 2.2 but not the entire bulk of it, the reason why for this is because robtop has made 3 other geometry dash games (geometry dash lite, sub zero, and meltdown) and the free games are doing better online than the one that costs money, getting more people who are on a budget. If you ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE WRITING it will say *this will be unlocked when the FULL version of 2.2 is out* so we have already gotten 1. What everything will be like in 2.2, and 2. With this information key. We know that it will take a while to make an update and copy/change the thing 4 times. And, Guess what. He might be doing OTHER THINGS like FIXING BUGS, and doing things that aren’t even accociated with geometry dash. Robtop is human too, and he shouldn’t be on the screen working all the time because soon he’d get bored. Which is probably why this is taking forever. Your never mad when Minecraft takes a while to be updated so you should act the same with other people/companies.",I love this game and I can explain why we haven’t gotten 2.2
5,2022-11-25 00:12:48,"Basically, people are mad because the game won’t open for them, which is bad, but there’s no reason to cry about a $1.99 game, which so happens to have a long, and I mean, LONG overdue update coming up that fixes the problem. Sure it’s taking 5 years but you stated it would be this year. I mean people, WAIT FOR A SHORT TIME. It’s not the end of the world. Also, it may be the update that’s messing up their Geometry Dash. I had an iPad mini (Forgot the generation) that was in iPadOS 14.4 and GD worked perfectly (Also it was this year). Then I updated to iPadOS 15.1.1. There is where GD crashed. But then I got my new phone (iPhone 13 Pro Max) but it was iOS 15 pre-built. I saw if GD worked, and BOOM! GD works now :) . Maybe also its their device. Because now my phone is now 16.0.2 and it STILL works. In conclusion: PLEASE WAIT FOR GD 2.2 ITS NOT THAT FAR, also you’re a great developer RobTop :) . But if you CAN, can you fix lag? Don’t worry, i’m not a “ROBTOP YOUR GAME IS UNPLAYABLE IM GETTING 58 FPS YOU SHOULD RETIRE 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬” I’m a calm person. Also this has longer than I thought.",I don’t know why people are mad at you RobTop.
4,2018-09-09 07:03:43,"I’ve been a long term player of geometry dash, in fact I’ve been playing for almost 5 years. This game has a number of astonishing features. First the music is perfect. There’s not one song I could hate in this game, the music is outstanding. Second I love games that don’t have an end. Sure rob top only made so many levels, but other creators make amazing levels that push the limits of this game. Third customization, there’s so many different styles you can become, and so many game modes to play with. Now if the game is so good your probably wondering why I gave the game 4 stars. The main reason is to top himself is kinda lazy (no offense) I understand he’s trying his best, but when your game only updated once every 1-2 years, things get repetitive, and that’s why the game has started to die. So many great players, creators, moderators, have quit because of repetitively doing the same exact thing, it doesn’t become fun as it used to be.  SUMMARY: great game and music but if your willing to download, be patient with updates, and don’t rage when you get really close, you can do it, and don’t get mad over a game.📱",Developer issues
3,2022-12-19 03:20:03,"First off, I have an iPhone on iOS 16, and it shows the robtop logo for a second, and then crashes. But on my iPad, which is on iOS 12.6, it loads and plays perfectly fine. I think this is probably due to the game not being compatible with the new iOS updates because robtop has not updated this game in 5 years, but I am no expert at that kind of stuff, so I don’t know. With that being said, for the people who can play this game, it is fun and addicting to play! I play it every day, and have gotten pretty good. Awesome layout, easy to navigate the menu, and awesome levels that are a little bit harder than the one before. Also, one more thing, for those of you players who are like me and like to have the level percentage showing, go into the settings menu, click on the options button, and then look through there until you find the button that says level percentage and click on that. That is all for now, so don’t waste your money on this game if you are above iOS 12.6  I will post an update to this review if Geometry Dash Full starts working on iOS 16. Thank you for reading my Review!",Works on iOS 12.6 or earlier
5,2018-06-10 19:49:46,"It is really good once you get into the spirit of geometry and knowing themes and difficulties of each level. My only thing against it is the lack of care for keeping the game up to date. This is not one of your usual games that has bug fixes every 2-3 weeks. No. This is the game that tortures all players by promising updates shortly after each other but in reality making them annual. Each update that fixes certain bugs always brings new ones, and the failure to realize that has led to this game being practically broken. The leaderboards don't update properly. My custom levels that I upload sometimes disappear and all the likes and comments in its history are erased. Overall, the game works pretty fine, but my biggest concern is that new players who realize these errors right away will think that this is a 1-star game. It is not. The whole idea of a cube jumping over triangles was ridiculously spectacular in the first place, and it is time to keep that in the light. So long story short, We Want 2.2 Now!  -Jeremy Elledge, or in geometry dash, 09smiley.",I love the game!
5,2023-01-28 18:42:09,"Nobody will probably see this but I want to say this game is superior, and I think many people would say the same. Last week (when making this) I beat every main level in under a year and every single one is so well made and can see the effort put (maybe except for Time Machine, Deadlocked, or Clubstep, but still). I don’t have very many complaints but here they are. I don’t really like that if you beat a gauntlet level or daily/weekly level that if you just search it up normally you “have” to beat it again. I put quotation marks because I personally do that unless I really need the mana orbs. Another complaint is that I think the rating system should be tweaked for the main levels as some don’t work well (Can’t let Go should be harder, Jumper should be hard). Otherwise, this game is great. I don’t want to say Im good at the game, as there are way better players than me, as my hardest is like…. Deadlocked, so I’m pretty ok. But this game is absolutely amazing and helps me when I’m bored or have nothing else to do.",Really Good!
4,2022-12-09 23:55:20,"Robert topala (if that how you spell it)This is a great game. I know it can be frustrating with demons. But overall this great. Someone tell me what this setting is. Im not that good at this this game. But tell me why it has to be star rated to be a demon? Also why is half the trigger so complicated. I do a least focus more on beating level other then creating them. This is great it’s worth the pay. If you don’t want anger issues or anything breaking do not download this. I will say, this game is very raging and frustrating. I would rate the nightmare as a 8 star to be specific. But it would be unfair to the people grinding it. Also tell me how the follow trigger works. This is a great game I recommend downloading the lite version before downloading this version (the full version) One last thing… 2.2 TAKES TO LONG! Also when the sound was not working I tried restarting, it worked once. The next time it happened, it did not work? Is this a setting pls tell me, so I can try to make one of my first full level. So I can put sync. FIX THE STUPID SOUND. For iOS 16.1.1",This is great! But raging and weird stuff
4,2023-08-02 01:28:09,"why can you only have 100 objects in 1 custom object and the max of custom objects is 100. like, the object limit for 1 custom object should be 1000. and the limit for the amount of custom objects should be 150. ad i have ideas for 2.2. you add a new vault called the vault of rubrub. here are the codes for vault of rubrub. you: gatekeeper. rubrub: how do you my pets name!? for this one to work you must free the monster. you: themonsterescaped. rubrub: OH HECC NAW. you: rubrubpowah123. rubrub: i thought i blessed you with that. you: michigun. rubrub: wait is that the triple spike guy oh hecc naw. and i have some new gamemodes. the train. in levels, you can place tracks that the train can go on. you on pc, you right click or on mobile, tap on the top of the screen to go up and left click or touch the bottom of the screen to go down. also im mobile player. and why are some things in geometry dash VERY difficult like getting 100 of each shard. and theres a bug in fingerdash at 34% so fix my problems and add my ideas pls. also the jump rings are orbs",just a few problems and ideas for 2.2
5,2020-02-08 18:08:34,"Geometry Dash is a fun and addicting game, but there are a lot of things that will trigger you and make you wanna not play it anymore. One thing is, there are two levels that will absolutely trigger you if you are new to the game or even if your not new but just an average player at the game. The levels that will trigger you are: Cycles and Hexagon Force. These levels with trigger you because your high scores will be lower than fifty probably and it will trigger you having just these two levels that aren’t a demon level with a high score under fifty percent. There are goo things about this game too though. One thing is, that the other levels are fun and a lot less triggering than Cycles and Hexagon Force. Another thing is that you can create other levels and play other levels created by other REAL people. The last pro about Geometry Dash is that there a lot of customizations for your block, and spaceship, etc. So overall Geometry Dash is a 4-star game in my opinion. Red this before you try it out!",It’s alright
5,2019-03-17 19:51:49,"Wow, this is probably one of the first games I’ve ever played in my life. In my opinion the game is so much better and more addicting than Fortnite! (I can see the hate coming in). Anyways there is one problem that comes in the game. Actually two. First of all, the game is not allowing me to upload any levels (that I have verified with no start positions, with all coins, and completely 100%) so can you help me with that. Also, that when I put my email in, sometimes the email is invalid even when I spelt in correctly and checked like 13 times. So is there a way to fix it or am I a guest forever. Anyways, despite my problems and my longings for Robtop to fix them, Geometry Dash is a great game and I will never stop playing! It is fun, fast paced and challenging! Thank you for making and programming Geometry Dash!  P.S. WHERE IS 2.2!?! I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG AND YOU SAID IT WILL COME OUT! AND I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT GEOMETRY DASH SUBZERO! I KNOW THATS A THING! BUT WHERE IS IT IN ORIGINAL GEOMETRY DASH! PLZ PLZ PLZ!  P.S.S. sorry for shouting I’m just desperate for 2.2 I sure you taking your time",This is a great game!
4,2022-07-24 16:17:08,"I would like to start this off with I’ve beaten all the levels in the main game on my iPhone and it took me over 50k attempts. I would rate it 5 star, but 2.2 still has not come out and it does not even look like 2.2 will be that much better. Not only that but on iPhone the experience has been less than mediocre. I have a very good phone now but it still does not register my clicks a lot and it can be very frustrating. Unfortunately the game has kind of been outdated in a way. With all the face paced online games and everything geometry dash has just gotten worse over time without updates and well it’s been a long time. I just don’t think I would play and enjoy this game Over many apps in the App Store. I’m ratting it 4 star still because on the bright side it is addicting at times and is unique from a lot of other games. Ya so maybe update your game (just a weird thought). 4-3 star cool game. Don’t play if you don’t like Grundy games. Really Grundy games.",Good game but some problems.
5,2019-02-03 19:47:19,"If your a parent and you want to know if this game is ok just read this, this is a good game, it’s rated what it’s rated for a reason. However it’s not educational except for increasing response time and hand eye coordination. It’s good to have your kids get a game like this because it inspires creativity which is the most important thing anyone can have. The only downside is the user created levels, the levels that are featured get approved but other levels are not for kids under 12, but they can only be accessed if someone is to search it for the title and actually find something if they don’t attempt to search it then they should be completely fine, so they won’t run into anything either they would have to want to search it. But sometimes when it comes to content there can be mild profanity which should only be a problem with kids under 10 depending on how mature your child is. So all in all this game is safe for the most part and is a good source of creativity and it’s cheap.",If parents are curious read this
5,2020-08-20 01:34:52,"I’ve been playing for a while now and decided to write a review. This game has entertained me for 2 1/2 years. I have beat some of the hardest things I have ever done in any game spending 40k+ attempts on levels. I’ve played from stereo madness to the extreme demon online level Conical depression by KrmaL (81% best). This game requires a lot of work though so if your not willing to put that in then this is not your game. However if you are willing to work on levels for a while then this game is the perfect game for you. I’d recommend doing the main levels in order instead of in difficulty because doing them in order will help develop your skill set throughout the game. The hardest main level by far is deadlocked (took me 7k attempts) if you can beat this then you will be able to do great things in this game if you put in the time and effort. Who knows if you download this game you might be a future victor of the Golden (Hardest level in the history of the game as of August 19, 2020).

5,2023-01-02 01:10:18,Since it’s been 5 years since an update. I’ve been waiting for years to 2x it for 2.2. I thought it was coming long time ago. But no. It just stayed. If there’s no 2.2 the population will lower down beacuase there’s no update. It got even boring. I don’t play any of this anymore. That’s why I’m sad. For some ideas for 2.2 can you add the lava really damage you to death. And fix the bugs and stuff I found lots of secret places. Since it’s five year later I’ve been playing for how long it did probably 2 years. And stil didint find it. Im going to continue about ideas. Can you make more coins each level. And a new level deadlock 2. And make it easier to get coins and add a working tv that takes long. But this game is fun it used to be. Now its boring beacuase there’s no 2.2 update yet. The game is forward. All times. That platform mode can you add it more early before 2.2 update. Im getting really bored. This was my only game I had to play. Now I’m into roblox now.,Why is there no 2.2
5,2022-01-17 15:31:18,"First thing is that there is a weird glitch that doesn’t let me into the game, I have an iOS IPad maybe that’s why it doesn’t work but this game looks really fun and I’d really like to play, I don’t want to disrupt you working on 2.2 but please fix this glitch. Another idea I have for 2.2 is a new game mode: phase, you can’t jump with it but you can switch to top or bottom of a block by “jumping”, for example when your at the top of a block when you jump it’ll take you to the bottom of that block, regardless of how big the block is. Final idea is like the new game mode I suggested but with orbs, jump pads, and portals where it does the same thing and brings you to the bottom of a block. I’d be really happy if you fixed the iOS glitch because geometry dash seems to only load on newer iPads because my brother can play it easily so maybe you can fix it for older iPads I’d really appreciate it. Overall this is a really good game. :)  r u b  r u b",Glitch and 2.2 idea
5,2022-11-03 20:38:40,"I was wondering if you could give us a peak at the next update and what new features will be there. Next I think we should not have to download the music. You also need to fix some of the musics so if they say they can’t be used they don’t show up as the song for the uploaded level. The game is great but I think we should have to do a bit less for the glow and much more. The master emblem is hard to get so once you reach that point in scratches shop it’s 2500 instead of 1000 gems. Next I think that you should make the game play with higher quality and make sure that the game doesn’t freeze, or crash. Next I am pretty sure the dupe glitch is back because I got a bunch more orbs from an normal level and I was given 200 instead of 100. Next you should do an age verification so if your old enough there is not a cussing restriction and the littler kids can’t search up or say anything with bad words and it censors them out for them",The new update
5,2023-07-09 21:05:43,"So I have been playing geometry dash LITE for a year now, and I absolutely love it. So a week ago I decided to get the full version cuz it’s only 2 bucks and it add a lot more. When I downloaded it I was so excited! But when I opened the app it crashed! So I tried again, same thing for around 10 times. Until I tried deleting it and downloading it again. And it still didn’t work! I don’t know what is happening! I restarted my phone by turning it all the way off. And then it happened… IT: didn’t work 🫥. So I looked at the update log and saw that the last update was 5 YEARS AGO!!!!! So if a developer is seeing this, (they probably won’t but) please fix this problem. Btw I have an iPod touch and an iPhone but I use the iPod touch more. Can you please help me fix this? I rate it 5 star tho because this lite version IS LITERALLY THE BEST GAME I EVER DOWNLOADED!!!!!!!!! So please update geometry dash full version to work on a iPod touch.

3,2018-11-22 15:04:07,"I’ve played this game for like 4 years and I started in 1.8. I’ve seen this game grow and change, and I have to say it is amazing and has so many possibilities. But just recently my editor invited 2 new bugs. One won’t let me place or move the screen after I play a level in the editor, and the other..........WON’T LET ME DELETE OBJECTS UNLESS I DELETE ALL OF THAT SAME OBJECT. It is so annoying that I have pretty much quit making levels. The other problem with this game is that there’s not enough updates. I know they take long but either RobTop could hire people to work on it, or just stop cramming so much new content in each update. I would be fine with mild amount of content in each update every 6 months but 2 years is unacceptable. And the last problem is stop making free games. I know they’re supposed to lead you to the full version and give a sneak peak of the update but just work on the update rather than free games that never get updated. Like seriously we don’t need 4. Those are basically the main problems with this game. If these things get changed I’ll rate 5 star.",TOO MANY EDITOR BUGS AND NOT ENOUGH UPDATES
2,2020-02-04 05:21:53,I mean it’s a really good game don’t get me wrong but some controls cause you to die and rage. The main one that’s happening the most to me is when your at a spider part then when you hit the black dot that makes you go down made me go up causing you to fall to the spikes a really good example for this is finger dash I don’t know if this is just happening to me because I just got this phone but my old one did the same thing. The next thing is about the rewards you get for example you’re daily gifts you like get  about 150 orbs of both chests witch makes it really hard to get orbs. And also about diamonds the chests in total for them is about 50 witch makes you have to wait days to get diamonds yes I know you can get them by doing weekly levels and demons but it doesn’t give you enough diamonds for it you need like 500 diamonds to get scratch’s shop and 200 diamonds for the other shop and the same amount for the basement and the challenge in the vault other than that geometry dash is a very decent game                                                                                     .,Naeeds easier controls for mobile and other improvements needed
5,2018-10-12 17:28:39,"So, I've been playing this game since August 2018, and I LOVE IT!! I've beat Stereo Madness through X Step, Theory of Everything, Electroman Adventures, and Blast Processing! They're all fun levels... except for one. Cycles. Maybe I'm still a noob, I don't know, but this level still gives me issues. I feel like it's a luck-based level, and since I'm a mobile player, that pushes the skill required to the maximum. Not all of my taps register, and some either too early or too late. You also have the tendency to put a LOT of triple spike jumps in some levels, this one included. I honestly feel like this level should not only be an Insane level, but should also be worth 12 stars. Even Theory of Everything is easier than this. Cycles is the only non-Demon level I HATE. Heck, I even like Stereo Madness more. I know this sounds nit-picky and opinion-based, but there's no way Cycles should only be worth 9 stars. That's my complaint, but other than that, this game is wonderful!",Amazing Game! Just 1 Issue Though...
5,2022-11-14 02:52:04,"Its a great and challenging game and it brings me nostalgia. I remember i used to fear Stereo Madness like it was a demon level when younger and now I just beat my first real demon level (by no means am i good to any level.) Just a great and amazing game and I wouldn't make any changes at all. If you haven't bought the full edition, its a great purchase and i’d say its even an investment. This is because I know its crazy but Geometry Dash requires so much eye tracking, muscle memory and brain usage. Also, last time i checked theres like 20K+ games made by the public which is 1000 times more than the standard selection. Also so much more other features like the treasure cave and stuff. I know that pros can choose literally any of the 21 levels and instantly beat it but i can only get to like 5% on Clubstep. Great-going, Robtop. Just don't let anyone buy you and ruin Geometry Dash. Microsoft ruined Minecraft, another W game thats right up there with this game.",Great Purchase
5,2023-07-26 20:54:09,I’ve been playing this game for 5 years now and it has still been one of my favorite games. Gd has been out for almost 10 yrs now and overall the game has been well developed. There has been millions of different levels made over its lifespan and there are still countless others to enjoy playing. I know many people are mad that 2.2 hasn’t came out in 6 yrs now but rob is only one person so it is still fine. And for the people writing bad reviews because it’s “so hard” are probably just and 8yo who can’t even clear stereo madness yet so stop. Also the community is great sure there are some hackers who hate on the game here and there but that’s why there are mods to ban people who do that so don’t worry. I have an account that I play on a lot and I play with my friends and btw it is free to make an account so I recommend this game to you guys :) btw my account is Bl1tzgd72,Gd is fun I have played for 5yrs now still worth the time :D
5,2021-08-22 23:37:29,"Hi robtop, I have some questions about the 2.2 update. Here are the questions I have: 1. When will you put the 2.2 sneak peek, give the release date for it please. 2. When released, are you gonna fix the sync so You can save the game so we can get the icons (Meltdown, subzero, and world) in the full version of geometry dash? 3. Are you either gonna put the icon editor in 2.2, 2.21, 2.3, or other updates? 4. Are you going to put two new modes swing copter and Jetpack? Are you going to make customs of the jetpacks? 5. Is there any new difficulty in geometry dash 2.2? Yes or no? Yeah, that’s kind of what I’ve been asking. Here are some bonus questions to ask: 1. Are you going to fix the bugs that are in subzero? 2. What gauntlets are you going to put and give the names of the levels. 3. How many more days/months 2.2 will come? That’s all for me to say. Have a good evening, robtop. :) Rubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrub.",Just when will 2.2 come?
5,2023-04-25 17:33:50,"Geometry dash is an amazing game. I truly am in love with the fact that you can build levels and buy very cool skins. This is my go-to game right now. However, it starts to get kind of boring with the fact that there are almost no new levels. I completed all of the levels including finger dash but after completing the same levels over and over i got a bit bored. Now i simply make levels and nothing else which is fun, but its kind of repetitive. My suggestion is to maybe make new levels every week or month, just to keep the player interested and maybe being like “ man i can’t wait to see what other levels rob-top comes up with next week!” I know it is kind of hard to come up with a new level every week, but being a person who makes levels as well, i have made good levels in under two hours, i think that you can do it. Sincerely, A veteran geometry dash player","Good game, some suggestions"
5,2020-12-25 16:18:43,"I have played geometry dash for two years and have enjoyed it thoroughly. The graphics are clean, the gameplay is fast-paced, there is so much you can do. There are a couple problems, though. RobTop (or as the community calls him, RubRub) has not released a new version in three years, and the last update was mainly bug fixes. Another problem (though this may not apply to everyone) is that the game is frustrating. Picture this: you are cruising through a level and you have all three coins in your back pocket, but you are about to face the most difficult part of the level. Long story short, you die, you break your phone, you instantly regret it (except I didn’t break anything). It’s bound to get you annoyed, but it’ll keep you entertained for a while. There is also a level editor where you can unleash your creative abilities or your mischiefs for other players to try your creation. Overall, not bad at all.",Great game but highly frustrating
5,2020-05-24 04:14:48,"I see that some people say that oh i cant move objects and fade things but um, actually, you can. Just go to the object you want to move and press group object or something like that and the put the move option and put the group of the object and every 10 points for it to move is iqual to 1 square. So if you want to move it 4 squares pit 40 points. And if you want it to move at a certain speed enter the speed number and i believe the number stands for points per second but it should work out. Try and mess around with things and honestly, you could create awesome levels like rob-top. I wonder what that dragon creature in the dungeon is. DONT TELL ME. And honestly this was a great game and i would rather play this instead of xbox but it can get boring... in 8 hours... so honestly, you are a great person rob top so, you just made billions of people’s days, i think. And if you have rated this game three or less stars you go to the devils landia.",Who would think about this awesome game?
5,2020-03-24 20:20:45,I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove this game 2.1 is amazing the game is just amazing because it like the controls and everything that’s all different kinds of levels for everyone and that’s why I love this game because you know it’s kind of a cool game I really appreciate how it has these little secrets here in there we’re players can kind of do you know experience what the secrets are like and then there’s like all different kinds of like dungeons and I was kind of all these kinds of things and I just think it’s kind of cool that’s why I recommend getting Geometry Dash just you know the original oneThat’s why I recommend people getting Geometry Dash number one I’ve played Geometry Dash meltdown I’ve played Ledisi I’ve played Geometry Dash world I’ve played basically all of the geometry dashes and this one is by far the best and that’s why I recommend for people to get this game,Best game in da world
5,2017-04-15 01:41:53,"Why doesn't apple create all apps for each apple electronic they make? It's annoying because people really want this game. I spent all my money just to get this game and all I get is nothing when I downloaded it. So I kept trying, nothing so I looked and saw that it wasn't on the IPad Mini so like it makes me mad which I don't like because now I have to wait 13 days just for an IPad because of this stupidity of where you have to use these apple electronics on other games and not all the games are on the apple electronic you have, just for me. I think you can just make the games for each apple electronic on there instead of suggesting putting a game on one apple electronic and when another person wants, they don't have that apple electronic for the game of which they want.

4,2022-07-31 12:42:30,"The game was a good experience for me to play as a child. There were many available maps for selection that I could choose to do, and I loved the game growing up. There were times when I got to those levels that it seemed I could never pass: Deadlocked, Theory of Everything 2, and clubstep. I redownloaded the game to play these maps specifically and to reminisce my experience of seeing it as impassable, just to realize that I could not do anything further than open the app! Whenever I tap the icon to load the app, it would go as far as not even loading the game fully. To simplify, Geometry Dash would open for a split second, then it would crash. I never got to play the game a second time so here I am, reviewing it! I hope anybody else who played did not have to endure the same difficulty I did; if so, however, they can further explain my take on this. I hope this crashing error is fixed soon. Thanks, and have a great day!",Good While Playable…

Speaking of the music, how on earth did you get/make it?!?also I’d like to say that the levels are to hard I can’t even make stereo madness unless I’m in practice mode. So plzzzzzzz make an xtra easy level. Also I’ve been trying to share my level “Shapes” with you all week and it keeps saying “upload failed” EVERY TIME! So pls fix this bug and FYI I use an iPad for this also I worked SOOOOOOO hard on this level it took 2 weeks because my mom wouldn’t let me have screen time but I still worked really hard on the cool shapes so pls fix this bug immediately if you don’t I’ll give   This app a half star rating and bad-mouth it ok we have a deal?

3,2020-03-22 22:21:17,"This game is amazing. Great gameplay, great visuals, and great soundtracks. However the ship game mode is extremely inconsistent. I’ve beaten several demon levels as well as all of the dev levels and I have to say that the ship is extremely inconsistent. When every other game mode requires precise precision compared to this game mode being all about spam tapping for control of your ship it’s really not fun or a good challenge. Momentum is also a huge problem with the ship. Sometimes the momentum will carry you into spikes if you tap even just a little bit. Other times the momentum will be so powerful that you’re holding the screen and nothing happens. I think the ship game mode needs removed entirely if not reworked. Momentum does NOT have a place in this game. On top of that, this game is NEVER updated. I redownloaded it after not having played it for a couple years to find that only ONE new level has been added. That’s pathetic. If you’re gonna be a game developer, then do it. Look at the rate your community makes levels and it take you YEARS?!? For ONE level?!?",Great game with one HUGE drawback
5,2019-04-15 16:43:48,"I you guys didn't know but there are some hidden areas in this game and I honestly think it's really cool, but you release this monster from a cage and he leaves you a chest with a key that unlocks the demon gauntlet and says, ""you will need this for when I return."" I don't know if that's exactly what he said but that's what he was trying to tell you, but he never returns. He also says ""Now I can finally accomplish what I have wanted to do. DESTROY THR WORLD OF GEOMETRY DASH!!!"" But he never does and once you complete the demon gauntlet, nothing special happens. So apparently you DIDN'T need that key for when he comes back because he doesn't come back, and you wasted the key on a stupid gauntlet. I haven't finished the gauntlet, but my friend has and he said all it does is give you like a color and an icon, and that's IT! I honestly like this game a ton, but you seriously need to Finnish the whole thing with the monster in the cage.                                            -Merrick Horsley",Monster in the cage
5,2018-09-29 05:18:11,Ok first I’m a 4th grader who does not care about writing properly and if you wrote a bad comment you are a kindergartener and you may be writing these comments because you are not good at this like me I can’t even complete lvl 1 but I can beat retray and I love that level and also so I know how you feel frustrated on levels because before when I first played I tried about 287 because I really did not know that I was a super noob but noob means bad at which means I am that but I don’t care and also there’s never bugs or fixing needed for me and I think this game is perfect how it is robtop I don’t even know what update 2.1 is :/ I’m so sad but I found a funny thing robtop you have to make it so I can’t get the free stuff even more easily buy just going into website and going back to geometry dash and get the stuff so that actually is one big I found and other peeps what do you mean by bugs like free stuff? Well bye,If you said there’s a bad side of the reviews read this
5,2017-12-27 13:44:37,"So, I’ve been playing this game since 2015. I’d say I’m pretty good. 120 demons beaten by the time of writing this (my account is called Kkbleeblob). I’ve got 5000 stars and 1000 user coins. For all you parents, this game is not educational and is completely made for fun. Don’t go calling this a piece of crap just because you’re bad at it or you have such a bad device stereo madness lags for you. This game has an entire COMMUNITY. If you know all the aspects to this game, you can find it really fun and entertaining. Just one thing: I don’t want this game to turn into just another platforming game where you go left, right up and down. In 2.2, robtop seems to be taking the path of going back and forwards more, which I think might ruin the game if he goes too overboard. Also, I hope he doesn’t add the random trigger, because this is a skill based game, not a luck based game.  You probably haven’t read this much, but if you have, hope you take this into consideration.",Really Great Game...
5,2020-08-17 14:15:57,Ok first of all I’m obsessed with this game but it is hard from when you make a transition from the third level to the forth dry out is probably the best music one ever but when you get to the upside down part is confusing because you have NO IDEA what to do there I had absolutely no idea and I can’t get past it in the third level they show you these weird orb things that you jump on I had no idea what that was and in the second level it’s also confusing because you get shown this super jump pad and I do also think that the coins should be easier to get to because right now I have NO coins because they are kinda hard to get but other than that I love this game it’s amazing there’s so many things and I can’t wait for more levels but I recommend buying the lite version before you buy the real version to see if you like the game first because it’s not everybody’s game that’s really all I have to say five starts love it.,I love love love but....
5,2022-07-26 22:24:08,"This was my most favorite game out of any games i have on mobile. And because it doesn’t take wifi to play the levels, it makes it better! Like if you were going on a plane or somewhere you don’t have signal, this is a game to play that current time. What i like about the game is it never can’t stop making levels and updates! If geometry dash stops creating levels, we can make them also. And it’s a game where you can’t complete, there is no, “ You completed the game!” it’s a game that takes actual skill and takes time to master it. It just keeps on going which is the reason why it hasn’t died. Now on to the glitch, this doesn’t effect anything but it would be better if you remove it, so when you exit and join geometry dash again, the music doesn’t load. So it would be better if you could do that. Thanks for making my childhood robtop, and great game.",glitch and gameplay
5,2022-01-20 00:37:28,"No.1 death orbs and pads, here’s an example, they are crimson coloured pads and orbs where every time you land on a death pad or tap a death orb you die. No.2 Bird mode, here’s an example, A magenta coloured portal where you turn into a bird, how bird mode works, every time you hold the bird will stay in place every time you let go the bird will go up and down similar to Wave except every time you hold the bird stays in place if the bird goes down and you hold and let go it’ll go up. No.3 five times speed. Here’s an example, I don’t have an example but there is a level that does have this and that level is Mountain King by funny game. No.4 backwards orbs and pads, Here’s an example, every time you tap the orb or hit the pad you’ll go backwards and if you tap the orb or hit the pad again you’ll go forwards.

People get upset because the 2.2 update hasn't came out yet but really, ain't a bunch of people constantly making levels that are better than each other good enough? I play a good level like Moryo and I was like wow that one's awesome! And then a new one comes that's way better and I'm like well these creators just aren't slowing down the pace! You should really get Geometry Dash and if you rage, remember to slow down take a deep breath and stop being a crybaby. Playing Geometry Dash without losing also helps if you take it in slowly even if there's some parts going quick.A lot of the times people tap too quickly for some reason so they look like a bird pecking at their phone.",Geo dash da beeeeeeeeessssssttttttt!!!!!
5,2020-07-12 15:46:05,"Geometry dash is one of those addicting games that leaves you yelling in frustration, but is so dang rewarding when you FINALLY beat that level.  Also, Fingerdash is really well done. After doing the other levels, it feels like a final boss level! Me and my friend back in 6th grade would just take turns playing fingerdash, and thankfully the song fingerbang isn’t bad, and doesn’t get old very quickly. Now I don’t know what I’ll do when I best it.  But then you can try to get the coins in the levels! But if that’s to spicy for you, then try some online levels. I really recommend “The Creator,” it’s such a good level. Or if you want a HARDER level, look up “BreakZ,” or “Cataclysm,” as Cataclysm is the hardest Demon you can rate. And BreakZ is the easiest demon level. So if your think on spending a dollar or so on this, I say, definitely. And realize how good it feels when you beat a level, let along a harder one against an easier one. Overall, 5 stars.",Geometry Dash Is amazing
5,2023-09-21 03:06:44,"This game has kept me entertained more than any other game ever. I love making my own levels and although I haven’t made an account yet because apparently my email is invalid, but I plan to in the near future. I’ve been playing this game at least once every day since I was seven or eight, and have never gotten bored of it. I’m still working on beating my first demon level. One of the only things about this game I think could be improved are the level placements. Time Machine and Cycles are way harder than Xstep, yet placed a difficulty below it, and both theory of everything and electroman adventures are labeled as harder than clutterfunk, but are way easier. Also I think electrodynamix should be a demon level. None of these are huge problems, just a bit annoying. Amazing game that I would highly recommend you play, and let me tell you from experience, you won’t stop.",Best mobile game ever!!!
4,2019-02-09 20:43:47,"I love this game! You can play and make awesome levels and I just love the idea in general! I’ve been playing for about 5-6 years and I still think it’s fun, but also kind of rageful. But... I originally got the game on my tablet and accidentally erased the game. I got my progress back on my tablet but then wanted it on my phone. I did EVERYTHING but the progress was gone. I still had my account on my phone but not the progress. The reason why I give a 4 star rating is because this thing can happen to anyone easily. So if the developers can prevent this from happening, that would be AMAZING. Maybe it was not the game and me plus the other people just simply forgot to do something to save the progress or didn’t do it correctly, then the game isn’t to blame. But if it wasn’t, then it should be fixed. Other than that, the game has nothing else wrong with it ( except some bugs but those aren’t too big of a problem.) Again amazing game and appreciate it.

5,2020-07-28 10:25:33,when i started it was 2016 and i was bad ofc in the beginning and i just kept doing very bad and it took me 3 whole months to do the first level. that’s how bad i was but i just kept playing. at first i did hate it but my friends got me into it and that’s when i started playing it a lot more. After 4 years of playing it still doesn’t get old even if it’s not updated yet for the new version. I could now do demon levels but still trying to get better to do other hard demon levels in the game. what i recommend is that you practice the level ur trying to do as much as possible and then once u feel ready you go and finish what you started. Finally thanks to robtop for making such a great game that had me playing for years. I hope to see more improvements and that he doesn’t give up on his masterpiece. enjoy the game everyone! -peptodash211,the best game ever to have!
1,2019-06-30 12:30:28,"So far it takes way to long to update a 2D game and it gets boring really fast once you complete all the levels, yes you can go to the creator levels but they all look the same and is half impossible to play this game on mobile as it can take up to 600 attempts for an easy demon. What the point playing it on computer when you can play much better games on a computer then that mess. The Save system is incredibly annoying as sometimes it doubt save unless you delete saved levels and songs and one mistake can lead to everything being deleted. I’ve played this game for a long time and to see it go like this is just sad a game that can have so much potential is under the hands of a developer that takes years to release and update witch is unacceptable. If he was smart after this he can sell it to a company and be lazy all he wants after it because he defiantly won’t be updating again as it will take way to long as if you look at the update history. The only thing keeping this game alive is the community making levels and he’s not getting enough backlash for how lazy it is maybe because most of the players are 8-11 years old.",Lazy Developer
5,2023-03-25 03:26:33,"This is a very fun addictive game. Overall, I completely support it: fun gameplay, nice sound track, and an awesome community with masterpieces of levels. I also think that most can agree with me that this is a very solid game.       The one problem with this game is its lack of updates. I understand it is a single developer game but me and the rest of the community have been waiting almost a decade for 2.2 to come. There has been way too many delays for me to count. However, I may seem impatient for the update to come, but really I think the developer, Robtop should take all the time he needs for it. Since 2013 this would have always been a five star, and even with the lack of updates, the hasn’t changed much when it comes to my opinion.

5,2020-05-27 21:29:31,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. I really love how you are able to create your own levels for others to try out. It makes GD more fun and less boring for a llooooonnnggg time. Still...there are still things I think you can do to improve the game even more like making the space in portals bigger. What I mean by that is when you are transforming from a cube to a ship ball spider or any other special object, you have limited space. Again, this is an awesome game, I just wish this was possible so people can make even cooler levels. Another one might be a 3-D mode of your level, or at least a 3-D view of your level so to make it look super cool. I would also prefer to have no limit on the copy section in the editor with the C is. Lastly, I’d prefer that everything, and I mean everything to be rotatable in the editor.

5,2019-06-07 14:08:02,"Geometry Dash is a game where it is so addictive but it makes you scream at the same time. The reason why you’re screaming is that you died at 99% in Fingerdash. This game is a must-have and it is extremely fun to play at least once every day. I love how you get a bunch of options to choose from to design your cube, and how there are so many forms your cube can take, like a rocket ship or UFO. When you complete a level (Let’s say Electroman Adventures) you get a new design for your cube, which is the best prize you’ll ever get in your life. Trust me. And when you complete a level in practice mode you’ll either get a color or a cube. That’s also the best. You can also get colors called, “Crash Test Dummy” or, “You Shall Not Pass!” when you keep on dying on a level. It’s absolutely hilarious! In conclusion, this game is the best game ever created and if you don’t have it... GET IT NOW. Am I the only one who screamed during Electrodynamix?  -Naomi",Absolutely Amazing!!
4,2019-06-05 13:37:44,"This game is a very fun game, but the only thing is the updates take too long. It’s been 3 years since the last update was released and it’s been making the community bored. The update 2.2 will sure be AMAZING but we all think to top is just trying to torture us by not releasing songs. About 30% of the songs out there have a part in the song that would be perfect for those big box static camera things. The reverse triggers will also play amazingly annoying. Don’t even get me started with the random trigger. There are also videos out there making animations such as “why to top hasn’t released 2.2 yet” that provide a ridiculous story of why 2.2 isn’t out yet. But besides those looooooong updates this game is cool. The community can be very toxic sometimes though, I one time got a message saying to kill myself but that’s a different story. I would recommend this game to people who are patient with updates. I’m sure robtop isn’t working hard on 2.2. Get it?",Good game but slow updates
4,2023-06-13 18:22:58,"I have been playing Geometry Dash for years. I love this game because it’s fun, challenging, and always excites me. Me and my friends would always compete to see who can beat all the levels first. It has caused a bit of rage in my life, but that’s just what makes it fun. There’s so many cool levels, but it would take forever to try them all. I also love the backstory that goes along with it. It’s just that one day, it wouldn’t let me get into my account. I tried opening it many times, deleting it and reinstalling, refreshing my apps, cleaning storage, but nothing worked. And recently, I tried again and it worked! I was so happy and I tried logging into my account, but all my progress was gone! I had beaten all the levels, had so many skins, and all of it was gone. I tried contacting the owner but he hasn’t responded yet. I would make this a five star review if my progress was saved. Thanks for reading!","Geometry Dash is great, but there’s one thing."
5,2023-02-25 19:09:36,"This game ant all the other games RobTop (aka RubRub) made, the regular Geometry Dash has blown me away! Out of all the games I have installed this should have been the best. A couple things that bugs me is that they don’t show the custom level I am trying to find, and that has been annoying me. The second thing that has been annoying me was I don’t know how to change the color of the background in the middle of the custom level. Changing the color of the background was completely IMPOSSIBLE, and looking through Google doesn’t help. Since I was new to Geometry Dash, things have been impossible. Now after playing it for a few weeks I got used to it. There is one thing I’m always wondering, and that’s how to make an account. But all and all it’s a very good game and I like it so far.

5,2020-07-16 14:24:11,"hello and this is a list for some 2.2 ideas! 1. Add some story mode like your going on a adventure or something. 2. Add more secrets! People like me that have done all of the secrets and vaults, pls add  more secrets or vaults! (This is not in the list) can you fix a bug we’re I can’t share my levels! I’m a good creator but I can’t send out my levels. (Back to the list) 3 add more levels and more stuff to create. Add more main levels, and when you start creating a level. You know how in 2.2 you can turn around and zoom out and in? How about you put a new thing that’s called flip and zoom flip is it flips the screen so you go the other way. Zoom is you choose a place for a corner and another one and then it fills in the space between the corners that you choose, when you play it it zooms in and out and there is a button that you can press that sets the zoom to default so it",Ideas for 2.2 (I don’t think it’s coming in 2020)
5,2019-05-04 03:22:38,"I love love love this game, I love the RobTop made levels, and the user created levels icon, I love how this is an offline addicting game, this is one of my favorite apps, It is a very cheap game considering how fun it is. I think geometry dash, is the best mobile game that is addictive. Although I do have a considerable question. I still love this game even though, when I am making a level, sometimes I have to exit, then go back, I don’t mind it, I would just recommend fixing it. Anyways, you should also add a feature where you can make,”Move Triggers” Be able to make other triggers (Including it’s self) Move... other than those, this is an awfully good game, it does delay sometimes, but that’s fine, but I have a level idea, for a demon level, it should be like stereo madness at the start, then glitch out, and become a super hard demon. Just a thought. So yeah, RobTop, Love this game, and please make 2.2 come soon. Thanks for the game...",Incredible
5,2018-06-23 02:30:07,"You should have a team, Rubrub. As more people play the game, the game becomes more complicated, and the updates get longer; it seems to be a necessity. There is literally a Geometry Dash community; it only makes sense that more than one person helps build the game. It has been my favorite mobile game since I got it, I have never deleted it, and I've had it for 4 1/2 years (since early 1.8); but it seems really important for the success of GD to have it go faster. Everyone can agree these updates are to taking way too long, and the truth is they won't get shorter. Having many people develop the game helps creativity, speed, and quality; giving your fans the content they've been so desperately waiting for. If already have a team, shame on me, but more developers would really help. It will always be your game, Rubrub. Farewell.  -InfinitySquared (pls check out my levels)","I LOVE this game, but I have one huge suggestion."
4,2018-12-22 23:56:49,"I love how you have editing and all that, but START MAKING MORE LEVELS! It’s been MORE THAN A YEAR since your last level came out and you just make these other useless levels and apps, like Meltdown, World, and SubZero. And I thought your next level was going to come out a year ago, because after you made GD World, you made GD 2.0 straight after that, so I thought after you made GD Subzero, you would make the new level right after that! But you didn't, you waited a whole year, telling us nothing except ""New level coming out soon"" as in ""New level coming out in a year"". I am dying to see 2.2 with all the End triggers and Reverses! And I really want to try all the other objects and triggers in level editing, like moving the camera. My friends and I used to play it 24-7, but now I’m one of the only ones who are still waiting. Please stop creating these stupid GD add-on apps and BRING MORE LEVELS 👍🏻 p.s. You don't need to make more levels just make more objects and triggers please",BRING MORE LEVELS!
5,2020-03-22 20:44:38,"I personally think that all of the geometry dash games are really good but the full game, geometry dash is the best. It has more levels that are even more of a challenge, more good characters, secrets that are everywhere, level creator, friends list, messages and more. I recommend to anyone who will pay 2.99 for this because it’s worth it all the way. I have always been a geometry dash fan and always will be. There are some bugs that need to be fixed though. Sometimes when I start a level, the music starts before the level but that really isn’t a major bug and people can just deal with it. Another bug is when creating a level, I somehow glitch under the half blocks and it’s just odd because it only happens while creating a level. Overall I really think this is a fun but stressful game that is ver addicting and should be at least stride by every one.",Best game ever
5,2019-06-09 07:09:03,"i see many people in the ""most critical"" reviews hating on this game for a bug that they encountered or for virtually no reason at all. this id an amazing game with so many possibilities, and different things to play with, i dont see how people could complain about how they got 95 percent on back on track because of a bug, then hate the game for it. also, 2.2. i have seen so, SO many people BEGGING and complaining about the fact that 2.2 hasnt been released yet. i will bear in mind that it has been two years, but still. we all know 2.2 is going to be great, no need to freak out about the fact that its not here yet. also, many people complain about how there are game breaking bugs, like the inability to jump, no matter how many times they restart. i wonder why only like 15 people have ever had this issue 🤔  this is not a bad game, it's just a bunch of 5 year olds that dont know how to play so they think its bad.",not a bad game lol
4,2017-06-23 03:24:48,"I have played this for 1 year now and I really enjoyed this game. It is very challenging, and can take time to get levels done and especially the secret coins (Star coins). It's not just one thing comparing and going back to the impossible game in which it was just tapping the screen to make it jump... but in this one there are things like wave (holding the screen...  Touch it and it goes down) and the ship (Touch this green and the ship will go up), and other things like that. And do you think you could either get with the beach and listen to the music we're actually know the scheme of the level. There's also a lot of memory involved in some of the harder levels just saying for some of you reading the reviews- thank you. I don't really like Geometry Dash world because of the different worlds like in the app or any of others I always like this original and all the levels in it continue with those amazing updates like to. One anymore thank you, Robtop.",eerelavint
4,2021-10-20 14:18:40,"I love this app soooooo much!!!!!! It is the most fun game ever!! I would compete with my uncle to see who could beat a level first, and I’d play for hours trying to beat him. There’s only one problem. I’ve had this game for almost 6 months, and now it stopped working. I have it updated, and it’s in my Home Screen, but it just doesn’t work!! If I tap it, it opens for about 2 seconds, then goes to the Home Screen again. If I go to the spot where all my open apps are (Double tapping the home button) it does the exact same thing, just this time it closes. I don’t know what’s going on, but I hope that I have been of some help to people interested in this game, and I don’t want to stop you from getting it, I’m just stating a problem I had to be helpful. If anybody has had the problem I’m talking about, please please PLEASE comment or respond to this review with a solution. I really miss playing geometry dash!!!!!!!!!!! ☹️😭",Amazing…with one flaw
5,2017-01-24 04:50:02,Geometry dash is a great game I've beaten all levels 3 coins but when 2.1 came out I was really hoping for a demon but you did fingerdash witch was fun but very easy if you are familiar with GD world I would really love to have a new demon Now let's talk about the bugs 2.10 has a major bug in its practice mode also account are being lost due to the update because of the way it's set up I've had many friends loose accounts because of it you should have just added the new level and keep the spider in GD world the way the game is displayed in online is why people are loose accounts and the major problem is the shop  because if you saved your lite version you cannot apply it to the current version those are just some ideas on what to change back to because I think geometry dash is a great game but my friends have stoped because she of the new update soon I will if not fixed,Great but needs major bug fixes
5,2019-05-01 05:14:17,"This game is great. It coming out was probably the best thing that happened to the mobile gaming community. The whole point of having a game on your phone was to pass time, and this is excellent. If you have a few minutes after lunch, you could do a few attempts at that level you’ve been trying to beat this last week, or keep building that demon level you were making. It’s just excellent. There is only 3 issues. 1. Only the big level builders get noticed. Serponge, Viprin, Danolex, that’s all you see. It would be great if other creators got noticed. 2. 2.2 development is moving too slowly. If you want to keep your huge fan base, I highly recommend you hire a development team to work on updates. 3. There is a strange glitch where the game will refuse to let you post a level, even if it’s been completed and it is appropriate. Please fix this. Other than those three games, this is an game.",Excellent!
5,2018-11-14 21:05:54,"I love this game and have been playing since it came out. This is by far my favorite iPhone game out there. I would suggest a few things for the game though. One is a post notification feature. I want to be able to get notifications when my favorite creators post a new level. I suggest a button on each individual profile page to toggle between allowing notifications and not allowing them. Also I would like to get notifications when somebody messages me, sends a friend request, or accepts a friend request. Also I would like a feature where I can save specific levels in a folder so that I don’t have to look for it again or scroll through my recently downloaded levels. One last thing is that sometimes I download a song and it won’t play and I would like that fixed please. Thank you for your consideration. :)",Fantastic game! I would love some new updates though
5,2022-05-27 00:52:12,It the best thing I’ve ever played! I loved this because of a couple things! 1. No app Purchases 2. It’s really fun if you like a challenge 3. It’s one of the best games you can find now and days 4. There is lots of levels so it will keep busy for a while 5. Awesome music 6. It takes a lot of determination if you want to get good at this game 7. There’s much other music games like this 8. Lots of different ways too make your character look cool so if you don’t like one thing you can try something else 9. All of my Friend's play it and we play all together 10. The levels actually get harder it’s not one of those games where the levels stay at the same difficulty it actually progresses and gets harder 11. In the add it showed the real game not something else. So take my advice if you like games that give you a challenge then do this if you like music then do this,AWESOME
4,2022-11-24 00:20:14,"This is great. My brother found out about this when he was like 4, (somehow) and showed it to me. I used this for a long time until I encountered a glitch. So I deleted it, and redownloaded it. But when I redownloaded it, it would load the normal screen, and not show the menu. It would just take me out of the game to my Home Screen, so I am unable to play it. This is still a great app, and I can play it on my old iPad and computer. So I don’t really care. And I’m excited for 2.2! I don’t really wanna rush you, as making games, finding bugs, and all that stuff can take years to fix. So I understand if 2.2 gets pushed back even farther than expected. It is currently November 23, 2022, the day before thanksgiving. I am currently waiting for 2.2, not rushing you though. I know it can take forever, once again. I love your games and support you, and I hope your community grows larger and larger. It is a great game, love it. ❤️","SO AWESOME, but glitch!"
5,2020-04-26 08:15:34,"Please stop rating this game horribly just because you didn’t expect it the way you thought it did. You literally bought the game for 4 dollars (or however much it costs). YOU decided to buy it for your own joy or someone else's (Im talking to you Karen's and parents). And the little kids out there saying that a specific level is too hard and you want the app to never exist, stop. Just stop. Nobody wants to listen to you arguing over a game. The game isn’t BAD because of the hard levels. It’s just fun a challenging music game. So try again until you get better, thats what practice mode is for. And for the parents that thought this was an educational game, I can actually see what you were thinking, but you could’ve at least looked up some gameplay of this app before you purchased it.

5,2019-08-01 11:51:10,hey I been a fan of gd since when u made the dang game it helped me through a lot of tough times and this game is perfect cool icons ships ufos spike balls robots spiders death effects and trails. My friends enjoy the game to as I introduced them to this game as a 5 star because I believe you deserve this 5 stars RobTop deadlocked is my fav demon because it’s tricky and it helps you be more focused because you wanna beat the level right and to beat the level you gotta know when to tap the right time and not to hold the button to long. I also like the create your own levels some levels I made have 30 likes which means a lot to me. The fact you can search up different levels that can help you practice for certain hard levels like for example club step for was very hard at the end because either I was tapping to early or not paying attention so yea this game is a 5 stars to me and keep up the good work!!!,Big fan
5,2022-10-05 13:45:35,"First off, I absolutely love this game. It’s full of amazing creators, fun levels, and silly secrets! Sure, it may take many attempts to beat a level, but looking at the game, you should probably expect a challenging game and need many attempts. If you aren’t a rage game enthusiast, probably not the best game, but if you enjoy trial and error games, this is one of the best games to play. There are many levels ranging from easy to some that push humans beyond their limits. As the game has taken a while for a major update, we all know it’s release will completely change the game. I expect from a game that started as a cube jumping over spikes and avoiding obstacles in a ship, and went to a completely different platformer game bringing levels that look absolutely crazy compared to what the game used to look like, I expect that the game not only has a bright future, but a historical legacy.",Great game!
5,2018-01-25 01:54:55,"I was once a noob playing this game. I couldn’t even get passed stereo madness. Then I watched some videos. And I beat it! I immediately became good. Now I beat all the levels with all coins and in practice mode. Free colors. Very talented creators make levels every day that get rated and even featured. If you’re stuck on a level, don’t stress it. You can always play a different one. There is a lot of rage when playing this game, but that’s what makes it fun. It has AWESOME MUSIC! My favorite song is Saguaro by BoomKitty. You can create you own levels and explore the levels that others made. Its amazing how skilled creators / players are today. Riot, ToshDeluxe, Michigun, NoctaFly, And many more creators inspired me to never give up on levels I can’t beat. One day, I will beat Bloodbath, or Erebus, or Sonic Wave, or some level that seems impossible to pre-pros, but once they learn, they will see. 😁🙂🎧🎼🎸🎹🔲🔳 I LOVE GEOMETRY DASH!!!

5,2023-08-08 18:07:56,"I don’t know how a game so simple could be so addicting, and also really fun and creative! I’ve been playing for two months, and I haven’t beaten any demons yet, but I’ve been theory of everything and I might be close. The level creator is actually really hard to use, but it’s how some of the best levels were made, like Deadlocked, Viking Arena, Power Trip, and more! Although some creations are…uh…pretty terrible, *ahem map packs* and then there’s the recent tab. It’s…cool, I guess. I’ve gotten all the spin-offs and they are all pretty fun! But this game is the best game on my phone right now! I’ve enjoyed trying to beat levels in the gauntlet like Frontlines Full and GhostTown, but I’ve beaten great levels like Acid Factory, Overture, and Ichor!

5,2022-08-04 17:39:27,"It used to be one of my favorite games, but there’s a devastating bug that started happening when I updated to iOS 1.15. Whenever I  played the game, it would immediately crash. Other people have had this problem, so I found some fixes. None worked. They say that it will be fixed in 2.22, but that isn’t until next year, maybe not even then! It would be great if you could add the bug fix before the update. If you are not a dev and you are on iOS 1.15, I recommend waiting until the bug fix. I am using a different device to play until the fix. One idea to make the game better would be to add a finale with a bossfight and about 20 stars. Also, make it so it requires all the secret coins in all the other levels and at least 100 user coins. Please add this, I think it would be awesome. Overall great game.","Fun game, devastating bug"

3,2020-06-15 22:58:03,"This has been an issue for me for over two years now, where I'm unable to view profiles, even my own, and comment on levels, view leaderboards, open daily chests, receive quests, view scores, view trending levels, view the friends quick search, backup data, sync or load data. I've mostly ignored it, because it hasn't been an issue until recently since I want to link my data to PC. I'm able to use Game Center, as well as view or search levels. I can't publish levels of my own, though.  I'm afraid to refresh my login as I'm scared I'll lose everything. I have plenty of private projects i've made for fun that I'd be completely despaired if I lost them. I don't know if anyone else has this issue, but I have no clue how to fix it without losing anything.

5,2019-07-23 23:22:48,"I really love Geometry Dash and it might be my new favorite game. The music and gameplay go so well together. I also really enjoy making my own levels and playing other people's. The level of customization is excellent. The only complaint I have is that I started out playing the free version, and I created an account to transfer the data when I got the free version. The unfair thing is, you need 10 stars to actually transfer and load data. So then I couldn't decide whether to keep playing the free version until I could switch over, or just start over and lose all my progress in the payed version. Anyway, despite the one problem, I LOVE the game and I recommend it over the free version. 👍👾📱  PS: The instructions for the level editor are very helpful, and my levels went from being very boring to having properly built and more difficult elements of gameplay.",Awesome Game
5,2021-05-12 18:42:54,"Geometry dash has been my favorite game for months now, it’s really fun to play, even though it can cause rages because of the levels being really hard sometimes. Now, onto the problems.  Minor Problems:  1: I wouldn’t really consider this a “problem” but I had to put it near. I think that can’t let go should be harder than jumper. They should swap difficulties as I completed jumper before cant let go.  2: When I play the game, on rare occasions, there is a glitch where at first it will constantly make me jump as if I’m tap-holding (I’m not). Then I go out of the level and then back in, but then a glitch happens where I can’t jump at all! It’s really weird.  MAJOR PROBLEM  Earlier when I was creating a level, i was working on a ship sequence, and then I put it to and end with the green portal, which should normally turn me back into the cube. But Instead, this happened:  I tested the level so far, and when I got through the green portal at then end of the ship sequence, it DID turn me into a cube, but it also turned me upside down! ....................WHAT?! This makes no sense. Please fix this bug because it’s very annoying and it makes no sense. Over all of this, the game is still really cool, but I’m sticking with 4/5 stars until you fix the bug.

So I was listening to music and suddenly I heard a familiar song. It was that Theory of everything song. I’m so disappointed with you right now because u copied that song for your game. If you created the music on the game first or made both those songs I’m sorry for sounding rudeish (at least in my opinion I sound rudeish). But if you didn’t make that song or made the game one of it second, just, please don’t copy ANYONE or ANYTHING again. It’s not nice to do. Would u like it if someone copied something good of yours? I don’t think u would. Now bye cya!",No words until the edit
5,2021-11-11 20:48:45,Geometry dash I s a great game and It always has been. The problem is not the teleporting for the demon levels the problem here is the game. When iOS 14.8 was here it was compatible but the game needs an update. Or maybe it needs to make it compatible with iOS 15.1 which is probably not going to take that long. So the most convenient trying to do is to make the game compatible with iOS 15. Then they should do the 2.2 update. That way people can play it and you creators can make money and still be making the 2.2 update in the process. So that’s the only reason why I can’t give this review a 5 star. Which means in other words update this game already. Or make it compatible with iOS 15 already. This is what all the fans want just because I updated to iOS 15 it doesn’t mean the game should stop working. So just fix already,THIS IS IMPORTANT
5,2020-02-04 00:13:06,"Ever since I started playing this game around 4 years ago, I've been hooked, every level is always a challenge and will have your heart pounding at the end of each level, and after you beat all the main levels you can move on to online levels, some which are even cooler then the normal levels, some online demons I suggest are, problematic, x, Death moon, and B, which is just an awesome level, the only complaints I have about this game is that updates take so long, we've been waiting 3 years for it's release! So here are some of my ideas   I think being able to change the practice mode song to a different song would be cool and you could buy like music disks in shop. Another cool thing would be more robtop levels with unique styles. And lastly playing online would be cool too, like playing with other people.",This game is amazing! (And ideas for 2.2)
5,2023-10-30 02:17:47,"This game was a staple of my childhood, i played it since 1.2. I recently (past year or so) got back into the game, as i was seeking some nostalgia. Now of course, the egregious wait for 2.2 was still ongoing. In august, i heard rumors of it being taken off the app store. (Due to the 6 year wait for 2.2) I simply thought that I would be grandfathered in, as i already purchased the game. It still worked even after the removal from the app store. But after i had updated the phone to iOS 17, it simply would not allow me to open it. I researched this and saw that this was a global problem for people who had updated to iOS 17. Obviously, i am upset by this, and hope that either robtop games can update their game so i can play it again, or apple to reinstate its place in the appstore so i can play the game that I spent money on.  - F35Enjoyer",I miss this gem
5,2022-11-30 03:07:17,"It’s a good game but like there’s glitches everywhere I see like I can close the app for a second and I can’t edit anymore and being a level editor I hate this. The people who bought this game are probably coming for the editor and I would like to tell this to the devs, it would be a help to everyone if the devs fix this THANK YOU. if you are going to buy this it is WORTH IT!!! It is a great game anybody will take hours trying to get good at editing and the RO top levels are great to! So if this game makes money and it cost money to make updates I hope that more people download this game. This was a warning for all the glitches here and to persuade all of you reading this to download the game I want you guys to download this. Not only to be downloading a random game I want this game to be more successful🤩 you might rage at first but TRUST ME IT IS WORTH IT",It’s a good game
5,2023-10-27 22:43:54,"First and foremost, Geometry dash is by far the most fun, addicting game i have played on mobile. I got the lite version about 5 years ago, and a month after that bought the full version and have never looked back. That being said, due to ios 17 the full version is no longer playable as it crashes at the title screen. This has forced me to go back to playing lite and other versions of the game. Initially, I figured that the geometry dash devs would fix this bug within a week and continue to work on 2.2 that is scheduled to come out this November. I have been playing the lite versions for 2 months with no such fix to the full version. Players, like myself, have become frustrated with Robtop’s lack of acknowledgement that their game is busted. Please fix the full version soon!",The longer you wait the more you lose
5,2023-10-11 13:17:15,"ok so i copped the game a few days after i got ios 17, and i wanted to play it while my computer was chilling doing its own thing (i mean macro) and it just decided, “lets just crash and never open again.” this was a mild concern and i was wondering what the heck was going on?? so i did a bit if research and this isnt just with my phone, its with legit everybody’s phone that recently updated to ios 17 like i did. robtop, fix your game please. ive been dying to play for a while. i do own this game on pc so i will give a somewhat legitimate review. this game is great, has had no bugs since the update, so i probably have to wait until 2.2, but thats alright cuz im patient, and overall, i give a 5 star for great community and awesome levels already included in the game. thank you for understanding - if you read this tbh.  TreeRex2009 :)",im so sad but its an awesome game
5,2022-02-21 23:06:44,"This is super fun and addictive game and all but lately it hasn’t been working very well. Every time I get on the app it quits out immediately. I have literally tried everything: -deleting and reinstalling the app 5 TIMES. -hard restarting my phone 6 TIMES. -deleting other apps on my phone to have more storage. And none of these worked. So if you can fix this or know how to fix it please please please PLEASE tell me. I really want-no-NEED to play right now!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡  BTW I totally agree with the other hundreds of players that say the same thing. Your game will be in the dumps until you fix that. But my friend can play it with no glitches, what is up with that? BTW2 are you even doing this anymore? Because with all these complaints, you would think you would have fixed it by now.",I want to play so bad
5,2019-03-14 01:38:46,"I love this game sometimes, and hate it sometimes because of the difficulty. If you are the type of person who is up to testing your muscle memory, hand-eye coordination, or memorization, this is the game for you. However, if you are the type of person who rages easily and does not have good muscle memory or hand-eye coordination, I would not recommend this. No matter what, you will probably end up raging at some point when it actually gets hard, but I mean like if you are the type of person who would go as far as to smashing you iPad or something, you might want to avoid it. But overall, I love the mechanics and gameplay, and I like being able to make your own levels and share them to the public. So if you are looking for a time consuming game, you should buy it. I hope you found this review helpful!","Frustrating, but amazing"
5,2022-02-03 00:28:52,"Everyone who bought this game and thinking it’s a cash grab most likely doesn’t know that iPhone update iOS 15 has made Geo Dash unavailable to play. This game will have a new update (2.2) and it will fox this bug. Other people who complain of the update taking to long are also not aware that RobTop didn’t intend for this to happen. If you are thinking 2.2 won’t ever come, you don’t know that some updates take plenty of time and effort to remove bugs and such. If you don’t want bugs in the 2.2 update, then be patient. Be very aware that people ask for features or give RobTop ideas and it makes RobTop want to add them, so if 2.2 were to come out quicker, you shouldn’t give him any ideas period. 2.2 will come out soon, just give RobTop some time and soon he will have released it. Hope this helps!",A Helpful Review
3,2018-09-20 22:24:31,"I’ve played this game for 2 and a half years now, and have only witnessed one update. I joined right after 2.0 came out, and then 1 year later, 2.1 came out, which is already a REALLY long time. Now 2.11 came out a few months after 2.1, but that only added, new skins, and created weekly demons. It has now been 1.5 YEARS, since we’ve had any kind of actual update. And the way its going, I believe that this game will die out about a year after 2.2, and there will ultimately be no more updates. Now this is just my assumption, but who knows. This is a really great game, with so many user created levels to beat, but eventually it just gets boring. I would play Geometry Dash Lite, Geometry Dash Meltdown, Geometry Dash World, and Geometry Dash Subzero and really getting to play the game and enjoy it before you buy it. Also, quick tip, Geometry Dash Subzero is a preview to 2.2, and has not been implemented as of September 20th, 2018, and has existed for about a year. Good luck and have fun. ;)",Really fun but...
3,2023-07-24 02:07:52,"I never write reviews for games however with the introduction of Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max, the game runs worse than it would if you played on some Walmart trap phone. There is lag nearly every time you press the screen which stutters the game and makes the game out of sync within the first couple of seconds in any level, high object or low. There are little reports of this game breaking bug and proves that Robtop has been paying little attention to the game and it’s community in terms of what needs to be fixed/added. The game is great but nearly unplayable at higher difficulties due to this bug. Many others, myself included, are fed up with this simple bug that Robtop has been dragging their feet on which makes attempting any level a hassle and an inconvenience. Again, a great game but created by a company that somehow puts less updates out than any other game similar to its popularity.",Used to be great however..
5,2022-05-10 14:43:45,"I’ve noticed that other people have been having the same issues as me, and it’s the fact we cannot open the app! But, me being a long time Geometry Dash user, I’m hoping that the 2.2 update fixes this problem. I’m also hoping that 2.2 is this summer. 😅 But I don’t think Geometry Dash it a bad game at all! In fact I think another reason why people don’t like the game is because they can’t beat Stereo Madness, Or is it just me? 🤔😂 But I mean, other than that, I just feel like I had to address this, especially to those who don’t really understand what’s going on, and for those that do know this whole situation, all I can ask, not just for me, but also for RopTop, I ask that we be more patient! Good things come to those who wait! Better things come to those who REALLY wait! So, just hold on.",It’ll be over soon!
4,2017-01-22 14:07:24,"Geometry Dash is such a wonderful game and there is almost never any lag! I love the new update 2.1 and I also love how they took geometry world and imported it to geometry dash so we wouldn't have to go through ads. I like the daily levels, quests, keys, shards, hall of fame, and the new level, Fingerdash. But there is one reason on why I rate this game 4 stars. It's because I have loading problems (I'm also playing Geometry Dash on an iPhone 6s) and I read some other reviews saying the same thing too. The lost gauntlets aren't loading for me at all. Sometimes it has the loading symbol, and it says,""something went wrong. Try again later."" And sometimes it just goes to that message without the loading symbol. I check everyday to make sure it would load, but it's still not loading. Also, when I try to view my profile, it says the same error message. Please fix this RopTop! Thank you!!",Loading Glitches
5,2020-05-07 05:12:19,"Geometry Dash Is Very Cool Because U Can Play Levels By The Community Which Is Amazing Also Like Some Others That Play Gd You Can Create Your Own Levels!

5,2023-02-05 15:43:16,"Robtop. When do you think 2.2 will be out? Tell me by sending a friend request to me. I also have an idea… it’s not to big so people reading this, don’t expect me to be full of great ideas. This might take a few minutes to build… also, I’m trying to get 2.2 out faster so people reading this review, don’t think that giving idea’s will speed everything up, it’s this gimmick where you go across. It might take a while to build but if it doesn’t take a while to build, you can do it. I’m not trying to rush you like most people did with the doors devs. When the doors update released, it was super buggy! I just want 2.2 to be here, and the private server requires special things and downloading! My parents won’t let me download suspicious or unknown apps.

5,2021-11-07 04:28:01,"I just started this game about a week ago. I love it so much. If there is one thing I like the best it is the portals. It’s so fun to go through them and see what happens, exciting to see what new mechanic I have not seen. I know I have not been playing this game for quite long but I would like to see a portal that you go through that creates copies of yourself but, all the versions of yourself act the same. What I mean by that is if even your original self can get destroyed and the surviving ones carry on their duty. Then if you survive to whatever said point, a portal that cancels out all copies except one(if you manage to have more than one surviving) continues forward. I don’t know if this is possible to do or if it’s already a thing and I have not seen it yet. But all in all amazing game and a true masterpiece.",New game mechanic?
5,2018-06-24 02:25:47,"This game has been an enjoyment for a long time and still will be, I’m a growing creator now, experimenting with new concepts and steadily gaining stars. This game has great graphics, creates funny memes and has a enjoyable community. Bad stuff now... This game is overrun with hackers. Though some are less common, people can still use noclip to verify levels, change levels and etc. (Anaban) Also were is 2.2, by now if someone said 2.2 is in my van I would come... jk but still, you need a team to work with to get updates faster. This part is only for Robert Topala now... you should get help from viprin, he is probably willing to help but if not find a way to get in contact with serponge, he creates games.... anyway I hope to see an update soon and would love for all the new features to be added in.

4,2019-06-25 12:47:03,"I personally love this game, but it really needs new content. Like a zoom function in the level editor, so people can do what you did with Press Start in SubZero. And an icon creator would be amazing. You could add an individual shop for it. A search bar to find the less popular ones, and a store for the more popular. It will cost 20,000 orbs to make an icon. The icon can sell for prices from 500 to 5000 depending on how well received it is. You can like or buy an icon to increase its popularity. All of the orbs or a twenty-fifth of the orbs will go to the creator on different occasions depending on how well received, still keeping levels the main way to earn orbs. And of course, you would be able to make waves and all that too. Icons cost 20,000, Waves cost 5,000, Robots cost 30,000, Spiders cost 25,000, Ships cost 50,000, Ufos cost 40,000, Balls cost 10,000, Trails cost 15,000, and death effects cost 100,000.",Has some things missing.
5,2021-03-28 21:24:47,"I remember I started playing gd when I was 8 years old, and I could barely beat stereo madness. I dropped it until I bought this version when I was 11, and after about a month or 2, I quit again. The next year I picked it up and I have been playing ever since. This game generally brings me joy beyond comprehension, and I never truly get frustrated at it. The game does have a little over 312 documented glitches, but most of them won’t affect the casual player too much. Some glitches actually make the game more fun, like the wave trail glitch associated with newer phones. I went from not being able to beat even the easiest of demons to beating over 30, completing the demon gauntlet and working on new, harder accomplishments. I thank you RobTop for creating this game. I am really excited to see what comes in the future :).",Probably my favorite mobile game
1,2023-10-09 21:16:20,My cousin told me about this game and I played on his iPad I was so excited to download it for myself until it wouldn’t let me sign in every time I tapped on the app it was just immediately kick me back out I got so frustrated I read download this app multiple times and I shut down my iPad a couple to it was really fun when I played on my cousins iPad which is why I hate to give it a bad review but it won’t work for me and I don’t know why I’ve tried everything. as I said right now I’m pretty frustrated and if I could give it a zero I would but if I could just get into the app hopefully it’s a glitch because it seems really fun and I would love to try it it’s just that I paid two dollars for practically nothing and I can’t really fix it because I’m not a big Tech person but I’ve tried looking on Google for videos I’ve tried everywhere and everything I’ve tried haven’t worked I don’t need to update it doesn’t says update so that’s why I feel like I wasted two dollars and that’s what I’m giving it a 1⭐️,Probably a glitch 🤷‍♀️
5,2023-07-27 01:10:01,"This game is so fun I could play it for hours. My childhood would not be the same without this game. This game changed my life in the best possible way. I remember when I was struggling to beat stero maddness on practice mode and now I am beating the hardest levels one by one. I would pay hundreds for this game and it’s only a dollar. Just wana say back on track is the best level it was the first one I beat. Even if this is hard at first, a little push and your the beat player ever. The best thing about this game is the music. It is so good I could listen for hours. I now have to go and rate geometry dash meltdown, sub zero and world a five start review now. Oh wait did I not tell you about the other games did I? Meltdown is a geometry dash game with 3 levels and so is sub zero but they are free too! World is game with more levels and it’s free too! Lite is a free version of this game but with less levels. There is aslo coins that are hard optional challenges that you can do. These challenges can give you characters to play as. You can get charetors from levels and coins. I hope this made you get this game.  Read this if you got the game and are bad at it: Just keep trying like I did and you will do great  Thank you for your time",Made my childhood amazing

I really do I’ve played this game for so many years n I just enjoy everything about it but… I feel like the game is very well optimized for the latest versions of iOS or newer phones. Basically what I’m saying is, the game lags with every tap on the screen (mobile playing) and it really throws the music off. If 2.2 comes with an optimization fix than please make it happen. I wanna enjoy the game on my phone again. Last demon I beat was in way back in October before I got my new phone. All in all I really enjoy the game but please fix this little issue.

1,2023-11-04 04:22:13,"I love the game, but RobTop is a sucky dev. He shouldn’t be the ONLY dev for a game of 90-something million players. He shouldn’t’ve crammed this massive pile of overcomplicated, server-frying features into one massive update that’s taking over six years to release, leaving the game to homogenize and grow boring without an update for years; at the very least, he should’ve released these features in small groups over the years to gradually give players the content they want and keep people invested. Also, he’s the only one who rates levels (so it takes a while, and he rates a lot of them poorly). Additionally, he shouldn’t’ve kept giving “release dates” constantly for years WHEN THE UPDATE WASN’T EVEN FINISHED and then just pushing them back. It destroys the community’s faith in both RobTop and the new update. Jeez. Also, the game doesn’t work on iOS 17, so be sure to either save your data and back it up to another device before updating, or don’t update if you don’t have that other device option.",Update the game. Get a better developer.
5,2022-02-11 03:50:14,"Hello. I’ve been playing for almost three years, and I have got to say, I like it! It takes several inspirations from The Impossible Game, and adds new challenges like changing game modes, jump rings, stuff like that. But what I really like about Geometry Dash is the ability to make and share levels. You can pick from the 21 official tracks, or you can even use songs from Newgrounds to use in your levels! Worth the money, and I can’t wait to see what’s happens in 2.2! P.S: I read some of the bad reviews for the game, and here’s what I have to say. If you crashed at the first spike in Stereo Madness, that’s okay. But writing a 1 star review won’t magically remove the spikes and hit boxes in general. And the fact that it crashes on newer devices is something RobTop is aware of, and is going to fix it in 2.2.",Good game
5,2020-02-02 14:15:07,"Hi guys I have some 2.2 ideas 1. Dash Tv, watch other online people beating easy, normal, hard and so on levels. 2. MULTIPLAYER! I think we all have been waiting for 2.2 long enough. This should be the main thing Multiplayer Madness, play with 3 other users and be the first one to get there if you die you restart be the first one to get to the end! 3. Reverse Screen. Okay so you know how in Press Start in Geometry Dash SubZero. At the very beginning of the level the screen zooms out ? How about that ? And lastly 4. Okay it’s been a while since I have played SubZero but there is a level called something like Trip Zone and there are Reverse orbs! How about adding something like that RubRub?

5,2023-07-17 17:33:04,"Wow. This game is awesome. With a surprisingly low buy price, this game takes a new level. Geometry Dash is one of my favorite games. I just have a few suggestions, though. Maybe add an option in practice mode, to where you can listen to the actual music in that level. For example, I was playing the level “Jumper” in practice mode and kept on dying. This is mostly because the beat in the music for practice mode, does not match the blocks or platforms. (Unless it just might be a “Me problem.”) Also, maybe add a bit more stuff in the shop? After you buy all the things, it becomes pretty useless. Anywho, in conclusion, this game is amazing. I love every little detail when it comes to Geometry Dash.

5,2020-02-23 01:19:36,"Hi, I am CoolKidAtGaming and I have been playing this game since 2015. It’s my favorite game because I used to not even get 50% on Stereo Madness and now I’m at Deadlocked and Clubstep. I have beaten every single level in the main game except for Deadlocked and Hexagon Force. I have beaten Clubstep but when I did I forgot the last coin. So now I’m trying to beat demons so I can get better and so I can become a popular gaming YouTuber. I’ve been wanting to become a gaming channel my whole life.

5,2023-04-10 03:48:37,I grew up with geometry dash and I think it is one of the best games for mobile but theirs a few issues like hexagon force needs fixing and electrodynamixs should be rated an easy demon and cycles should be rated an insane level  because when I first started playing it was a very difficult level to beat another issue is with clubstep it is a great level it just needs fixing on the first half but other than those issues it’s probably my favorite mobile game it is fun to try to beat every level and deadlocked is so fun and difficult I like to try to unlock every skin in the game and theirs always thing to do but the game hasn’t been updated in 5 years and like I said some of the levels need fixing but overall this is a 5 star game thanks,Great game few issues
5,2022-06-18 17:56:10,"Geometry Dash is an overall amazing game; the levels are fun and challenging, the game is addicting, there are no ads, and it is honestly the best game I have ever played. I can sit for hours just trying to beat a level, and I feel that this game helps you with your hand-eye coordination and musicality. However, I do find that there is a glitch on this game for my device. No matter how hard I try to raise or lower the volume of the in-game music, I cannot get it to play. I have heard the music in the past and I love how it goes with the level, but I can no longer hear it, which is really disappointing. I hope this can soon be fixed, because the music elevates the game. But, I still think that this game deserves a 5 star rating!! This game is full of endless fun and I love every second of it.",Amazing Game!!
5,2022-04-10 16:02:06,"So I love this game a lot, it is a really good pastime and I beat about half the levels and made some of my own really cool auto levels. The only problem is, once I got a new phone (iPhone 8) it wouldn’t work. I bought the game and installed it, but when I clicked to open the game, it immediately closed. I thought that was weird, and tried again, same thing. I deleted and reinstalled, but it didn’t work. Every now and then, I reinstall the game, but it never works, and it’s not like I’m out of space or anything, I only have used about a fourth of my storage. So I have no way to play the game except for my dad’s tablet, which I don’t usually have access to. I still love the game tho and if your device won’t do this, I highly recommend it. Hope this helped",It’s a really cool game
4,2021-05-04 11:28:44,"So, this is one of my favorite games.  I love the challenges that the levels bring me.  No, the problem isn’t the cost of the game or how many in game coins it costs to unlock the levels.  Far from it.  When I deleted this game, my GD account completely got erased.  When I tried to log back in, it was successful.  But here’s the thing.  All of my progress was erased.  From my icons and ships to the progress I made in the levels to the orbs I got, everything was gone.  I realized I had to backup my progress and save it to the cloud, and then load it back up.  Could you please make it available so that accounts autosave, Robtop?  I suggest that you buy this game, but be aware, once you’ve made an account, back it up to the cloud before deleting the game if you think you’re getting the game again.",Great game! One problem though
5,2020-08-23 00:57:21,"This game may seem plain, simple, and counterproductive, albeit, it is. But there is something about it that makes the game incredibly addicting and incredibly happy about the progress you make on it. Do you know those euphoric rushes you get when accomplishing something difficult? Or when you get it during a ‘barely survived’ moment in a video game? This game is full of those. It forces you to get better at the game and gives you those rushes every time you beat a level. Now with the euphoric rushes, you are going to get those moments that make you want to throw your phone/PC/device out of the window. And that’s fine, it’s manageable, and they are often worth the rewards and rushes of joy you get after finishing a level. I play it whenever I’m bored and you never ever get bored playing the game. Plus, no ads whatsoever.  Definitely worth the price since you also get to make levels as simple or complex as you want it and having other people play it. You can play other people’s levels, too.  It’s an amazing game, and if the developers are reading this, I want to congratulate them for helping wanna-be game developers to have a look at level design, making a game that pleases all, and overall helping me in those times of boredom.",Must Read If New!

5,2021-07-06 21:09:37,I’m gonna start off this is my favorite iPhone game. I’ve been playing for 5 years now I hade my account with almost everything unlocked and I saved my account then when I was deleting tons of stuff off of my phone and I didn’t mean to uninstall gd. I was like oops then I reinstalled it and signed into my account and tried to connect it to the cloud and it didn’t work ROB PLZ HELP ik that you probably got a bunch of stuff going on and working on 2.2 but plzzz help me figure out how to fix this and or just tell me my whole account is gone or the cloud thing is broken rn I just hope that rob gets an email when he gets reviews and if your reading this thanks for the awesome game and the ability to have creators make there own levels I check every day for the new epics.,ALL OF MY STUFF GONE
5,2019-11-22 21:59:04,"This game is 🆒and Amazing! Although it does not have to do with geometry math, it still is very fun. There are about over 100 Icons and different shades of colors that you can customize your character with! There are a lot of levels,I love back on track. You can make your own levels to! It may take a long time because you have to make the level go with the song. Best of all, Geometry dash is a whole story all together. The story is the most fun part about it, it is like a mystery + geometry + fun. It cost $2 but it is WORTH IT!!! This is somebody: 🙂:New game I found!😡: Uhhh! Cost money! 😒: Whatever. 😐:Time to play new game. 30 minutes later... 😋😃😁: THIS GAME SO FUN! 10 more minutes later...🙂: About to beat Dry out! 15 more seconds later... 😃😆😋: I BEAT DRY OUT! 1 Month later... 😀: About To beat FINGERDASH! 15 seconds later... 😃🤩🥳😝: I BEAT FINGERDASH! 😍: This is FUN Game!!!!!",Amazing!
5,2023-10-28 11:30:17,"I love geometry dash it is so cool. The levels, the squares or “skins” are awesome, and the making levels is so cool I love making levels, but there is one problem it will not let me in the game. So when I try to go into the game I pressed the button and when I got in the game it said RobTop like it always does when it loads but it said RobTop for a few seconds and then the screen went black and I pressed the screen and it just went back to the Home Screen. But one more thing, all of the other geometry dashes are working fine but only geometry dash casual is not working. So I hope you can fix the bug so I can keep playing because geometry dash is one of my favorite games on the phone because I have a PS 5 so the games on that are better but for a phone game geometry dash is the best!",So cool!!!!
5,2019-10-05 00:03:54,"This game is pretty fun tbh. I played this when i was 5 to 9 years old and today im still playing. This is so fun even though i don't see really that much updates. But still. Very GOOD. Also when i played this i feel calm after I played my other games. I think this game should a very popular, its a fun and calm game. It will be more calmer if the songs were picked different and little less ragging, but still this game is fun either way. I hope on day this game will be famous. I’m mean COME ON! this game is so fun!! but my friends doesn't like it but it doesn't matter to me cause to me this game is super fun. this is all i could say about this game. but still i recommended to make more updates and make this game more calm. but overall i love this game so yeah. btw this is my longest review ever 0-0.",Tbh this game is good even though it’s quite old.
5,2018-12-12 01:14:36,"This game is amazing!!! I can’t stop playing this game. Soooooo many levels too! Here are some update suggestions. 1. Make the way to change the color of stuff easier plz. 2. Add a level Calle Steprun. 3. Add a tutorial mode to making levels. 4. Add more icons. 5. Let all music be on all level like Press Start Full Version made by someone, people are not able to listen to the music (this may be for copyright reasons idk). Hopefully I see these suggestions in future updates! Oh and also can you add even better graphics, I mean they are super good, but I think you should add better graphics in-game. One other thing is that I think you need to nerf the level “Cycles”, Xstep is easier to go through. Can you nerf it for it to be a little more easier? Like with the Halfway Ship/Rocket part.",This game is hard to let go of!!!
5,2023-08-06 15:51:29,"So in the past I had a few games and was kinda bored so I looked on the App Store and my friend told me about geometry dash and good it was. It did cost me but I was bored so I got it! And it’s my favorite game! I love the 21 main levels I mean I think there is let’s see stereo madness, back on track, por- we that’s not the point the real point is that this game I AWMSOME I DONT CARE IF I SPELT IT WRONG THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!! And the best part is that you can build your own levels if you want too! And share it so others can play it! And you can even play other people’s levels too! And try to get your level to the HALL OF FAME just the best of the best levels out there! and you can try to beat the hardest levels in the game like slaughterhouse, of firework, and bloodbath! So have fun with this game! Thank you Robtop for this Awesome game!!!",I LOVE THIS GAME!
5,2023-07-09 06:18:14,"This game has done a lot to me, one thing that it has done is give me the love of my life. During one session of playing Plasma Pulse Finale, I was paired with a fellow geometry dasher who had similar passion for the game. We quickly realized that our playstyles complemented each other, and together, we were able to conquer several demons. As we continued to play and communicate, our connection extended beyond the game, and we began to share personal stories and interests. As our friendship flourished, we took the step of meeting in person. Our connection forged within the geometry dash realm seamlessly transitioned into real life, and we found ourselves falling in love. The game had brought us together. But it was the genuine connection we developed beyond the game that solidified our relationship.",This game got me a girlfriend
5,2021-01-12 20:05:02,"Geometry Dash is an amazing game, but with every game comes a bug/ glitch. For some weird reason, I can’t search anything. I’m able to click one of the difficulty buttons at the bottom of the search section, and it will show some levels, but I can click the Extreme Demon button and Zodiac will be outta sight. If I actually search something though, there’s a 99% chance it won’t show anything. Just letting you know. There’s also this weird thing that for some reason only happens to me where I will jump on a gravity jump ring and I will jump right after I land. Also, in Fingerdash, in the first spider part, where the black jump ring is, I’ll jump on it and sometimes instead of going down, my spider automatically goes up to the top and dies...

5,2019-11-11 07:08:52,Please make a new feature where if you delete a level you can recover if it  but that level can only be deleted forever or recovered within 30 days within a new tab called recover. If this tab it will show you your levels that have been deleted and can either be deleted forever or recovered plus you can open the level to see what work done on it but you won’t be able to edit it until you have fully recovered the level. Please add this feature because I lost a level I have been working on for several weeks now and lost all my progress because I was stupid and made 2 copies of the level before all my progress and forgot which one I was working on a deleted the one with all my progress.

5,2020-10-11 16:23:15,"Geometry Dash has been one of my favorite game for about a year, so I would like to tell you my ideas for 2.2!   1.  New difficulties. Harder levels like a level i made called “ElectroHouse” could hint a difficulty. Maybe Monsterious? Theres so many blades and spikes it’s really hard to complete. New difficulty names thought by me. Since there is a Demon Difficulty, there should be a Devil one too. And the difficulty I mentioned before for the ElectroHouse level i made, to put more simply after insane you could do sort of like the Demon icon except with no horns and add steam then make the icon blue.  2. Someone already mentioned this in another review after i thought about it myself its called Reverse Orbs and Anti-Reverse Orbs.   3. There should be something like power ups that make you invincible for 5 seconds of your having a hard time with the level you are on.  4. Maybe you can make a way where if we die we can use Orbs to respawn on solid ground and make you invincible for 3 seconds.  5. This is very important. Please unlock the levels that require the Secret Coins because some people have a hard time getting them. Like Clubstep, Deadlocked or Theory of Everything 2.   Thats all I can think of for now. Thanks for reading this! Bye!",My ideas for 2.2!
3,2023-02-22 14:21:01,"FOR ROBTOP (GD's developer) and anybody else who might have helped make the game.  Here are some ideas to (with respect, no offense) make GD way better!  First, and by a light year most importantly:  Replace ""demon difficulty"" names and icons with:  Extreme (insane icon but with orange fire over it)  Excruciating (demon icon but it doesn't look like a demon icon because yes)  Impossible (Extreme difficulty but it's blue fire which is NOT cold)  Game-Breaker (Purple fire)  Game element ideas:  5x speed thingy  0.25 speed thingy which I think can only get you over a spike half as big as a normal one  Maybe add powerups such as:  speed powerup (3x speed for 5 seconds)  jump powerup (jump a block higher)  any other ideas for powerups if you want  New gamemode...Probably the hardest idea to make.  Hmm... Current gamemodes:  cube  swing (is it called swingcopter? bc idk)  spider  ball (why is it also like a swing?)  wave (more like zig-zag)  some others I forgot their names and what they do.  Hmm, I have multiple ideas.  Mace:  Spider, but you can stay in place bc you are a MACE.  Looks like the head of a mace without the handle.  Gravity Ball  Ball but it sticks to walls and rotates the camera so that it looks like it's normal gravity.  P.S. it would be my favorite gamemode.  Also, last but far from least, please add colored trails.  That's it! Maybe add it in 2.2 or 2.3!",Ideas to make Geometry Dash WAY better
5,2021-06-13 19:45:32,"So, that glitch I mentioned in the title? Yeah. This doesn’t seem to apply to the more recent devices, such as the 11 and onward, but on the iPhone 7 Plus version, it seems to glitch the audio where it can’t play it if you exit out of the app for whatever reason, including checking control center and your notifications.   Except for that, it is incredibly fun and frustrating.  The game has absolutely ZERO in app purchases, a welcoming community, and some amazing levels. It also doesn’t collect any data on you, except for what you post on the community in comments, etc. (Kinda obvious.) Usage data also may be collected (not too sure on that) but it is a great game and TOTALLY worth the money. If you like rhythm games, get this. 10/10.","Albeit its glitches, it’s great."
5,2018-08-02 16:05:37,"I love this game. It has an endless selection of amazing levels and it has brought countless amounts of fun. However, there is a bug that happens when I load up the game. It loads really quickly and when it loads, there is no sound. I’ve tried pretty much everything to get the sound back, and nothing has happened. I have the latest software update on my iPhone 8, so maybe it has something to do with that. But whatever the cause is, please try to fix it!  EDIT: Apparently, turning the ringer on my phone to silent made the sound stop working, but turning the ringer back on put the sound back on again. This doesn’t happen on any other apps I have, so I don’t know why the sound is connected to the ringer, but I’ve fixed it, so it gets five stars.","Great game, one major issue (just fixed it)"
4,2019-06-19 21:10:57,"Dear Robtop, I have been playing GD for like probably a year or more and I like it but it has been in the same update 2.1 which it will get more boring everyday. I know it’s now 2.11 but it was just for bug fixes so it’s still boring. I would like to know when 2.2 is out. Also one question, are the new levels Toe 3 and Electrodynamix 2 or Explores? Because Youtubers were kinda arguing about that the new levels are Toe 3 and Electrodynamix 2 or Explorers. 3 more questions. Is the real music of Toe 3 and Electrodynamix 2 gonna be in GD? Because I hate the remix versions of the songs. Have you been busy on 2.2 making a lot of gauntlets because Youtubers have been showing what you have been up to. When you were updating it to 2.11 I thought it was 2.2 but it was just bug fixes update. Last question is 2.2 gonna have the new game mode called the swing copter?",Why isn’t 2.2 out yet?!!
5,2020-06-19 04:59:16,"GD is my FAV game (Not Counting ROBLOX). It has a pretty big variety of levels to choose from, even ones made by people! Just a few suggestions for RobTop to add to 2.2 even though he/she won’t see this.   1. More Levels! Yes, there is a variety. But instead of just ONE new level. How about 4 or 5? Maybe more Easy or Medium levels For less professional GD players.  2. More Portals! Once again there is a variety but, sometimes you need a bit more! How about a Squirrel? It could leap VERY far, Farther than the robot though. Also possibly a Gravity Portal, where you can adjust the speed for a certain amount of time without going through a speed thing.  3. Let’s get PRETTY speedy! As in, more speed things! One could make you go so fast you teleport almost. Or you go as slow as a snail.   4. Easier way to get the- Ya know... SECRET THING Just... Make it cost a bit less, no changes needed to... IT  5. Easy Orbs, Why not A bit easier Diamonds? Diamonds are EXTREMELY hard to get... Kinda. So make them a bit easier to get.  6. That’s all! Thanks for reading my review! If you read all the way Throughout my Nonsense, Then I 100% recommend you to GD! It’s a bit tough, but it’s so fun it makes you come back for more! Thanks for reading!  -Sincerely , GD Lover",⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,2022-07-14 00:26:53,This game is super fun! I’ve been wanting to get it for years but since I’m a kid and don’t have any money I’ve had to wait super long! It is worth the money if you are considering buying it. I’m suggesting that they make a super easy level or 2 for noobs(no offense if you are one) because it sadly took me a while to beat Stereo Madness. Also the different like cubes and ships and stuff are fun to play around with to see what you like. The levels are fun and slowly get more difficult. The only complaint I have is that if you leave the app for a second the music won’t work and the level designer is a little broken but nothing that can’t be fixed I’m sure. All in all this is easily the best game I’ve played on my iPhone. Hope this helped!,Best game on the App Store
5,2023-10-10 20:45:08,"Okay let’s just talk about the best game I’ve ever had. First thing you need to know: amazing colors! The lights are amazing! The levels could not be better. The difficulty is so infuriating that it’s funny 😆.Second thing: If you get lite…ADS. They drive me crazy! So I paid for this one that costs like $2 or $3. At first I regretted it. But then I found out that when you use this one, there are no ads! Third: Third thing: the obstacles is what makes the game amazingly addictive 👩🏾‍💻. Like how you can go upside down. Or like how you perspective changes. Or how you can ride a spaceship! From Stereo Madness, to Theory of Everything, to Fingerdash, there is nothing but fun in store when you play this game!

4,2023-07-23 10:25:32,"I’ve played this game for around 300 hours, and it’s easy to get absorbed in it. The Editor allows you to easily create beautiful levels, the Daily level is always worth a try… But after beating 43 demons and collecting several thousand Stars, I’ve quite frankly run out of things to do. Aside from working on my final level once in a while, and sometimes trying to beat some more demons, I barely play this game. Also worth noting; it’s likely that the community will have a bit of a resurgence if update 2.2 ever comes out, me and many other players will return to the game to see what’s new. But for now, the game’s dying, slowly. Their are more quitters, like me, than there are new players.

5,2023-11-01 06:51:20,"One of the most popular things for players to put in their review about Geometry Dash is that it has been a long time since the last update, and/or calling RobTop “lazy”. I’ve been playing since 2015, which has given me plenty of time to ruminate on where I stand with the future of the game. I need to warn everyone — for better or for worse, some of the core mechanics of it are about to change COMPLETELY.  Geometry Dash as a game and a community is in the single best state it has ever been in since it was made, with custom levels pushing the limits of what was thought to be possible to new heights every week. Quality is continuing to skyrocket, and yet, the endgame of the 2.1 era is coming to a close. It’s an honor to have had this game at such tough times in my life, and I’m sad to move on from such a great point in it’s history that I wish could stay for good.   Only time will tell if the 2.2 update will be a wolf in sheep’s clothing from a mechanical expansion standpoint, but all in all, on a larger scale, it will breathe new life into the game when it comes around. In the interim, I’m optimistic and still enjoying the 2.1 version of the game to the max.   🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",About the 2.1 Renaissance
5,2022-04-19 23:53:49,"Really fun! Some people having been running problems in which the game won’t launch. The advice I can give you is that for me, going on to a more advanced mobile device should fix the problem. The actual game content is very fun, as the community pumps out levels that get better in design and gameplay. This app gives more for what it asks for, and I think that’s amazing. The only bug I run into now is that when you leave the app, returning will make the music cut off. Deleting the window and relaunching the game seems to fix the problem, but I wish there was another way to make the music come back. Else than that, this a great game and recommend anyone who has a hunger for challenge and skill!",Amazing game! Just a few bugs.
5,2021-06-29 13:34:39,"The game is REALLY AMAZING! I just have some Ideas to make it five thousand out of five. (that was a bit extreme but ok) You should rerate the main demons as clubstep easy demon toe2 easy or medium demon and deadlocked should be a hard or insane demon. Also you should put in a portal which allows you to switch to platformer mode and put a separate song when you enter that portal, I think that’s going to be cool. Also I would like to have mod before 2.3 so can you please give me mod please? Also you should be able to draw a path for dash orbs (EVW suggested this) so people don’t have to place ramps or a moving block to customize the dash orb path.

5,2021-02-05 12:29:27,"I love this game and have for years, but it’s only just occurring to me that there is no ‘recently deleted bin’.  I think this would make a significant difference to the game, as there are many people who have complained that when they were working on a level and meant to exit out of the game, their thumb slipped and they accidentally deleted the level. This just happened to me, I was working actually on a level for a project for school, and I accidentally deleted the level. I love this game and everything else is good, but it would be really nice if you added a ‘recently deleted bin’, and it would automatically delete permanently if you really meant to delete it after 30 days. Other than that, this game is good. Thank you, and I hope you add the ‘recently deleted bin’.",Deleted Levels

I know that you are trying your best on making 2.2 really come to life, but could you please make sure it comes out soon, cause if it doesn’t you might lose a lot of money, sense people can’t buy your game, but I’m not forcing you to update the game, you should, but I would be happy if you did. I know 2.2 is a huge update with a lot of bugs, and your only 1 person to make it, just try your best and great job on the sneak peaks and the overall game it’s self.

The main levels in the game each have a step up of difficulty that really eases the player into playing. Geometry dash also has the BEST level creating system ever. It is easy to learn and fun to use. But warning, many online levels will lag your game, even on the best devices. Another thing cool about this game is the key system, and puzzle type things. The puzzle type things are little demon faces that will say things and you have to type in the right thing and you get a prize. Although this game is absolutely amazing in almost every way, the updates take forever. 2.0 took like a year (I think) 2.1 took two years and 2.2 isn’t even out yet!

5,2023-09-03 00:25:33,"The only game that I have ever spent money on, and being priced 2 dollars is incredibly reasonable for the content you get. Sure, the lite version is fine, that’s what my friend has, but if you have the extra money, get this version. I could not recommend it enough to anybody that wants a fun game to play anywhere, anytime. Edit- why the heck is 2.2 taking so long. Sure, 350 icons, one new mode, a “few” more features, but this shouldn’t take nearly 6 YEARS. Just add the new icons, add the editor features, and the swing copter, and finish in maybe 10-15 months from when 2.1.1 released. Just UPDATE THE GAME ALREADY ROBTOP.

I currently do not have an account because I do not even know how. But one thing I really want is you to stop stalling for 2.2 and just do it everybody has been waiting for 2.2 for like 3+ years.  Another thing I like about the game is that it’s more of a calming rage game instead of say fortnite for example, people sometimes literally  break their controller or keyboard, while geometry dash is a try again sort of game, it’s a bit like Minecraft when you die you get a you died screen or you just immediately respawn when you die. This is an amazing game but robtop please release 2.2.",I hate this game but love it at the same time
5,2020-05-01 04:41:14,"Some people don’t realize that plat-former games are not always easy. That is not a reason to hate something. Just because something is hard.  Also, some people need to think how this game is developed by one person. One. RobTop has been working on the update for a while now, but he doesn’t really have a need to at this point. Bothering him to release 2.2 doesn’t make it go faster. In fact, it’s probably making the entire process slower.  This game is good and the community has some bad moments here and there, but watching people come together for mega-collabs and just dedicating levels to people is a really cool thing to see.   I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a bit mad 2.2 isn’t out yet, but I know how long some things can take.   My point is, this game is amazing and it isn’t as bad as people make it out to be. People also need to be more patient as well. (Side note: nobody really criticized Terraria for taking 3 years to release 1.4. I don’t see the sense in criticizing this game. (This is speaking to Terraria fans))  Anyways, after reading this, I hope some people have a better understanding and more appreciation for this game.",To all the one star reviewers...
5,2020-08-28 04:41:25,"I’d like to write a different review, because, don’t get me wrong, this game is incredible, but there is some room for improvement (about an inch of improvement).  There are some bugs, like sometimes I need to step away for a moment to do something and when I reopen the music does not work and I halve to reset it.  Also, the music for finger dash is kind of annoying. I don’t like the weird anime-sort of style in music cause it just doesn’t cut it.  It doesn’t matter though I’m just saying my opinion.  I’d also like to point out that the game kinda gets me annoyed whenever I lose a level, but that you can’t fix.  I really appreciate how hard you guys are doing at making us satisfied with your game.  Keep up the good work.",Great game
3,2020-03-27 15:40:26,"I apologize for my other reviews. I get mad easily at games, but this is a real review: This game is eh to me. Mostly because of Clubstep, being the first Demon You unlock. I have been playing this game for 5-7 years, and not once have I beaten Clubstep. It’s too hard... and needs a nerf. It should not ever be the first demon you unlock, since people are going to get easily frustrated. I just got 95% on it... and I have died so many times in the level I didn’t even react. I just kept trying and failing. The level should be shortened and a bit more open. Please RubRub, nerf Clubstep. And I’ll be very very happy. I feel like the way you should get people into trying harder levels is to make Clubstep more open with less obstacles, and make the level shorter,so it’s 10x easier to beat, and when people beat it they get the option of trying the HARDER version, being the version now.",An ok game but... Clubstep.... (Updated)
5,2019-09-15 01:35:05,"This game is so much fun! I just got it like a month ago and I already have theory of everything 2 and clubstep. I have been playing this game for so long and a never ever seem to not like it. Electroman adventures, theory of everything, xstep, clutterfunk, electrodynamix, hexagon force, blast processing (I already finished blast processing), geometrical dominator (I already finished this level too), fingerdash (I am on 96% on this level OOF 😢), clubstep, theory of everything 2, deadlocked, cycles, time machine, stereo madness, back on track, poltergeist, jumper, can’t let go, base after base, and dry out. They are all so much fun! The demon levels I got are 29% in clupstep, theory of everything 2 I got 15% because it is so hard for me, and deadlocked I don’t even have 🤣. Well I am just saying that THIS GAME IS SO FUN AND ADDICTING AT THE SAME TIME!!!!!!!",This game is way to fun.
5,2018-06-10 23:31:36,"This game is one of my favorite games. You don’t need to purchase anything in the game like gems and stuff. You can also play with no WiFi which is definitely a plus because when I travel on planes it gets really boring. Some people might say that it’s too hard but after a while of playing and grinding it gets easier it just takes time. There is also a free version of geometry dash you can play but it’s not the full version, it just doesn’t have edit mode and some other levels but it’s also very good. I love playing this game and whenever I finally finish a level I feel very proud of myself. You just have to give this game a chance and try really hard. It might get very frustrating when you can’t beat a level but trust me it’s fun!",Awesome
5,2021-11-05 03:46:59,"Great game, good work! :) I really like all the features and what you could do in this game. Like create your own level, or complete levels and feel proud of yourself, and comment things you like to. I’m glad the new 2.2 trailer just came out too, I hope you make a new gd game for 2.2! There is absolutely no problem in this game! Great work, RobyTop I love this! But...I personally think this game needs some improvements, basically daily levels sometimes come late. Try to pick daily levels early please. Also please make updates quick, 2.2 literally had to take 3/4 years. And if you use controllers it could maybe block some buttons, please make more spacing. That’s the improvements I definitely need for the game to improve",great game!
5,2021-01-05 00:34:15,"Dude, you made our dreams a reality by creating this AMAZING game! Like really, If you didn’t make levels like clutterfunk and jumper + cycles, I wouldn’t be sad because I wouldn’t know those songs but if you did remove them when they got added I would be SOOOO sad, but not to worry, your probably never get rid of them. Also some ideas for 2.2 too! You should really make clubstep a medium demon I feel like and deadlocked is really a insane I think but something you must change geometrical dominator and electrodynamix they are really insane well electrodynamix is really an easy demon to me feeling like fingerdash maybe too. So an epic game but those 2.2 updates I am BEGGING YOU FOR and hope you have a good 2021 and hope you had a very merry jolly Christmas!",Thanks RobTop!
5,2017-04-01 18:01:07,First of all this game is a great game with a lot of fun contact however I have had a glitch or what I'm trying to create an account it tells me my email is invalid and trust me it's not!!! Other than that if you're looking for a fun game to play Geometry Dash is definitely the one it is super fun and never leaves your board it's tricky at times but if you just keep on trying trust me you'll beat that level. Update has to be the best update John should I just ever gotten it includes chess Hall of Fame daily levels and much much much more this game has a lot of skins that you could unlock for your types of character when you're playing the level. Definitely my favorite game in the App Store and trust me the money is worth it.😁😁 thanks Rob top for making this game!!!,Read meeee for honest review
4,2019-12-07 03:54:21,"This game features tons of awesome levels and even more online ones. The music is purely fantastic and the gameplay is attractive and exciting. The multitude of icon, color, trail, and death effect optionality really allows the player to be in control. The online levels and the level creator are also amazing tools that connect the Geometry Dash community together.  The only concern I have with this game is the lack of developer involvement in the game’s growth. The game has been stuck on the same update for over 2 years; the next update has been in production for an extremely long time, and has only been delayed due to developer laziness and extreme ambition.  Overall, this is an amazing game with amazing possibilities. But the absence of the developer is a huge issue that needs to be sorted as soon as possible.","Such an amazing game, it’s a shame it’s dead"
5,2023-07-18 03:05:33,"I love GD. The levels are fun and challenging, but some levels are rated harder than they should be. For example, Back on Track is easier than Stereo Madness, and X Step and Fingerdash should not be rated Insane. It is very hard to make levels w/ my IPad, but those are minor complaints and this is still 5 out of 5 stars for me.   Something else that I don’t like about gd is the music. I don’t like the type of music on gd, but don’t change it. I know a lot of people like it and the music helps me play because the beat makes it easier to know when to jump.  I love gd and it is 5 out of 5 stars for me. Robtop, if you see this, the only thing I want you to fix is to make the level editor more accessible for mobile.","Fun, but one thing."
5,2022-01-12 15:42:14,"When I first got GD Lite I just thought of it as a simple mobile game that is just jumping over spikes and blocks. And boy was I horribly wrong. I got GD full version about 3 years ago and I found many other fun and well made levels! And there even was a level editor for the community! I looked at some of the demon levels and they can really frustrate you in the best way possible. I normally now spend most of my time in the editor and the featured tab and this game is fun. The lore is rather hard to figure out but I can see that isn’t really the games main focus. This game is about timing, accuracy, challenge, creativity, and just enjoying yourself. I give this a game a 20/10. Well done robtop, well done.",Simple to learn but challenging to master
2,2021-01-09 21:42:52,"I was installing the game again to play it and got back into my account. My account progress was at square one and I had no items what so ever, even though I saved my account with all of the stuff in it. I told my friend to check my account on his friends list and it said I had all of my things and had all of my progress, but again, I had NOTHING. The game is fine but the accounts need to be auto saved and it needs to recognize your device or Email so that there are no problems when logging in and you have the things you had before. The website they have to make a new username/password and to register your account is poorly made and doesn’t get you to where you need to be. 2 stars for a good game but bad account saves because me and many others can agree that the game is more fun when you have a good account.",Doesn’t update progress and doesn’t auto save account
4,2022-08-08 15:58:52,"I played this game for years and now it’s kicking me out of this app, please fix this! Hello and I am an og player I played this game since it was created and I have never experienced it not loading it just exits out of the app and I have lots of my progress on there and I had to reinstall and it still won’t work but this was my favorite game I had and I want to play it again. Please fix this thank you :) This is something you need to see please I have been waiting for 1 year I need this to stop it’s ruining my life and I don’t feel good :( I need fun and I’m starting to hate this game the more it does this please just please fix this. Please look at this review RobTop I need it back. I can’t play this game anymore and I don’t feel good at all. 2nd this to say WHY ISNT 2.2 HERE YET!!!",Why is this happening?
5,2022-07-15 14:23:13,"Geometry dash has a very special place in my heart. I love creating levels, playing others levels, and overall playing the game. Although, there has been a problem in the mobile community. Geometry dash does not work after IOS 1.15. I think I know the reason. At first the free games did not work either. But when they got recently updated to 2.2, they worked again. The problem is that the games have not been updated in so long, that they have become outdated and no longer work. So I request you release a tiny update with nothing in it so the mobile players can play the game again. If you are reading this, then good luck on 2.2 and please take this review into consideration. Thanks.",FIX THIS NOW
5,2022-05-01 17:00:23,I love this game but recently I haven’t been able to play because every time I enter the game it shows me the robtop screen that you get before the loading screen for about three seconds and then it crashes I would love to be able to play again so if you can fix this problem that would be great I still have lots of storage space and I’m on the newest IOS i also tried deleting and reinstalling the app but that didn’t work either i was hoping it was just my iPod but it’s happening on my iPad to even though I have this and others might to I think this game still deserves a 5 star review.  P.S: meltdown is the only one in the series that works I did beat it though,Great game but I have a huge problem
5,2017-10-07 22:00:10,"I’ve been playing Geometry Dash for almost 4 years, and I must say, I’m extremely addicted. The vast diversity of player-created levels along with the ability to create your own levels makes this game well worth the money. If RobTop charged $5 or more for this game, I would still buy it.  Levels in this game reach such high difficulties that there’s always room to improve. When I complete a difficult level, I feel a true sense of accomplishment, which motivates me to try an even harder one to further increase my skill.  This game is the perfect mixture of simplicity (just tap/click to jump) and complexity (numerous gameplay elements, diverse array of levels, etc.). If you’re patient and willing to dedicate time to a game, I would highly recommend this.","My favorite game, period."
5,2023-01-04 15:53:51,Great game but you might have stolen it from someone else because it’s called the impossible game and if you would tell me that you have stolen it from that guy who made it just tell say it say it SAY IT ROBTOP! Sorry but I love the game you should add some more levels and Add more demons PLEASE And I’m waiting for new updates So you can move some of the buttons so yeah that’s all I had to say or JUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Why do I keep saying that? Anyway add more shops and add some more stuff and move some more stuff like when you hover over levels in the creations menu they gonna say description and other stuff about it I have more updates today I wanted you to get in the game but I just can’t really say all of them right now so yeah bye Roptop,Geometry Dash
4,2018-05-04 19:57:17,"I love this game. I beat all of the robtop levels. But I do recommend that if you don't want to practice for at least a year to get good, then this is not the best game for you.   There is one issue. When I download a custom song, sometimes it doesn’t play no matter what I do. I check music vol. I check if my phone is on silent. And I even delete and reinstall the song. Nothing works. Please fix this bug in 2.2 and it would be greatly appreciated.  Another issue is the lag. I have an iPhone 5s. Which was the newest phone when this game came out. But all of a sudden it lags like crazy. It used to lag on just finger dash. But then it slowly started lagging on more levels and now it lags on every level. Even stereo madness. On Low detail mode too. If you have anything older than an iPhone 6. Don’t buy this game.   Also servers sometimes go down after checking other apps that need WiFi and rebooting the game, but it doesn’t work. Please fix it. I get that you put all of the servers on your computer, but to have them shut down completely is a whole other thing.  P.S. I totally understand about 2.2 not coming out with loads of hate and pressure. I hope it does come out soon.",Amazing mobile game but recommended for steam
5,2020-05-20 02:12:15,"this game awesome it’s a rage game,  but I like the graphics! I hope other people injoy too! The possibility’s of you becoming moderater  is not common same with featured levels😱 the game is really cool over all😍 there is a full version and a non full version. And a subzero and meltdown😀. Creat your on levels to post online and let your imagination run whiled😄. 2.2 is a update that will come soon, also it has been under construction for 3 years😱 I have the game and I uploaded some levels to! make sure to creat a account ext. also you can try to be a moderator! click/tap the gear on the bottom of screen. Then tap help. after that click the req button. See If you have a chance. This review may not be to good but it’s my first one! Your favorite geometry dash creator signing out.",Awesome game
5,2020-03-21 22:22:35,"So, a lot of people that leave 1 star reviews are mad at this game bEcAuSe iT iS tOo hArD. Geometry Dash is supposed to make you rage. It’s a hard game. Other people are complaining about no in-game purchases. Why do you need in-game purchases? Anyways, this game is really good. It runs smoothly on most devices, and the graphics are crisp. 2.2 has still not come out even though 2.1 came out a few years ago, but people need to be patient. This game has NO in-game purchases, it is frustrating but fun, 2.2 is not going to come out because you complain about it, and making an account is pretty simple. The level editor is clean and has few bugs as far as I have seen, the search online levels is fine, and overall this game is amazing.",Geometry Dash is good
4,2022-07-31 11:01:44,I absolutely loved gd and I always made levels on gd but I updated my device and now I can’t play gd anymore which means I lost the levels I spent hours on I head that once this updates to 2.2 it’s gonna be fixed but I’m not sure if that’s true or not please fix this as soon as you can because gd was my LIFE I also tried play subzero and there was the same problem also tried geometry dash world and still there was a problem I haven’t checked meltdown my only hope is geometry dash lite which works perfectly fine but for some of my friends they can’t even open geometry dash lite which is terrible because gd is our favorite game so I would rate it 5 stars if this problem was fixed but for now I’m keeping it at 4 stars,It was great until I updated my device
5,2017-05-28 11:34:40,"I downloaded this game 3 months ago and discovered that it was awesome! I usually get rid of games after playing them for 1 or 2 months, but I never got bored of geometry dash. I'm not even half way through the game, and I'll probably be playing it for many months later. The music is fantastic too🎵. I would not recommend the other smaller geometry dash games (geometry dash meltdown and geometry dash world) because geometry dash meltdown only has 3 levels to geometry dashes 21 + hundreds of user created levels, and geometry dash world has 10 levels but they are only 30 seconds long (geometry dashes levels are one minute and 45 seconds long.) Geometry dash world has user created levels too, but they are the same as the ones in geometry dash.",Fabulously addicting game!
3,2022-09-22 10:30:22,"Don’t get me wrong I love geometry dash and it’s still one of my favorite mobile games ever! The only problem is that for some reason, every time I play this game the musics lags and gets of beat little by little every time I touch the screen to jump. I don’t know why this is happening or for how long it’s been like this but it’s a bit annoying and gives me OCD. I thought it was a wifi issue so I tried playing with wifi and cellular turned off and on but that didn’t fix the issue. Every time I go to tap the screen, for some reason, I can the frame freeze for a fraction of a second and the music gets off beat more and more. I don’t know if this game is still getting support or if it’s dead in terms of the developers fixing and updating the game anymore but can this please be fixed?",Games lags but not the music
4,2017-06-30 13:13:38,If you want a fun simple yet challenging game then this is perfect however for me there's a glitch that pops up every once and a while where there's no audio!? There's another glitch that when I go to open daily chests it opens a crack then says something like error problem occurred I would try deleting the game and getting it back again if I weren't on electrodynamics   I have a game mode suggestion an online multiplayer you would create a game and either invite friends or wait for three other people to join after that you would select a level and whoever made it furthest into the level would win (and you wouldn't all be separated you would all play so you could see each other when you jumped) but despite the glitches this is an overall great game,Great game...but there's a glitch
5,2022-02-19 13:07:28,"I love this game! It’s almost perfect in every way. There are hard and easy levels, there’s music, There is a lot that you can do. Also if you like this one and pass a lot of the levels then they made more apps just like it! I have even deleted to do all the levels again because that’s how fun it is!!! There is a flaw though. I dont know if it’s with the game or just a glitch but I haven’t really played a lot and now whenever I try to get back in the game then it doesn’t let me when I click on it it just brings me back to my Home Screen. But I downloaded it on my phone and it worked fine. I already tried to delete it on my IPad and but when I downloaded it again it didn’t work.",Amazing 🤩
5,2021-03-04 18:12:50,"This game is really fun and I play it all the time on my iPad. I first saw CoryXKenshin play geometry dash and I got the lite version and I wanted the full version. So a couple of weeks later I got the full version and it is way better than the lite version. It has more levels, secret doors you unlock, stores to buy items from and so much more. Some people rage quit because they keep hitting spikes or as they call dying they rage cause they get so far and they get frustrated. But still you guys should download this app because I enjoy it so much and I think you will too( shoutout to CoryXKenshin because he is my one of my favorite you tubers to watch when I have bad school days or when I’m alone or sad he always brightens me up when I watch him).",Download this game now

One of these one star reviews even said “I just want to play some fun Geometry Dash.” Even those people like the actual game, and the only reason this game doesn’t have (reviews ≈ 5/5) is because of those stupid reviews. One review was just complaining about how hard it is, (ngl sounds like a skill issue) and another was about how frustrating it is! I have no idea why people are complaining to the game developers about their own problems that aren’t related to the actual gameplay!

5,2023-09-27 23:31:59,so I love this game came obsessed when I was little but was trash cause I was little now I'm 11 and I'm pretty good at it beat all the main levels except the three demons clubstep 67% score implanted in my brain :/ I beat the nightmare(easy demon) so I have. Been trying to grind cause I'm excited for 2.2 after like 6 YEARS but on the other hand I play on mobile and pc but my mobile just immediately crashes whenever I try to play so I can't do anything pls fix this rob rob :] it's happened every time I open it it's been a week since I've played so if anyone can help me figure out how that would be nice but I'm just not able to play and I hope it doesn't last too 2.2,like this game but all of a sudden

1,2023-01-26 19:28:34,I have been playing Geometry Dash lite but one thing I love to doing games is make my own levels and there weren’t enough levels already in the game so I decided to buy the full version. when I buy the full version I already need to do two verification things which take forever for me to figure out and then when I install the game I enter it and it kicked me out!!! This has happened in mini games before so I do the things that usually work but nothing is working!! I look up some tutorials and I find nothing that works for me!!! I literally tried everything!! No I wanna watch videos of people Who are playing the full version I feel so jealous and all I want to do is play the game!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 also in case you see this and you’re actually going to fix it I am talking about the version on iPhones and iPads I will probably change this one star review to a five star review if you just fix this one problem!!!,Please fix this!!!
5,2021-07-31 05:24:59,"Now, I’ve been playing this game for over 5 years (back when there were only eight levels) and I enjoy it. I love the music, game mechanics and artistic designs that are featured. There is one problem that I face a lot: Account Save/Load. Before I close the game, I save my data to prevent progress loss (re completing levels, collecting coins, etc.). When I open the app I always have to log back into my account (which doesn’t save most of my completion progress). I’ve been trying to find a way to exit the game without this happening and failed. So, I want to ask is “how do you close the game without having to log back in?” Anyways, Geometry Dash is a fun game and I recommend purchasing it!","Fun, but one thing"

I love the designer mode because it unlocks a whole new section to the game you never knew you wanted. Yes it may tick me off that 2.2 isn’t here but maybe it’s gonna be big to the game! I’m not saying buy the game if you don’t like it I’m just saying that if your into rage games and challenges, this is the game for you. In my opinion, I feel this game is great and it’s not like all ripoff games where it’s pay to get everything. The game is a challenge if you want to obtain the stuff you want and that is a game that I like and proud to see. Thank you and love you 🥺❤️ <3",The reason this game is good
5,2020-09-29 03:23:10,I have been buying this game for days untill I keep createing levels on this game ITS SO COOL THAN ANY GAME THATS BORING but It costs money to pay it so in this game you can create levels you can do levels from weekly like if you see the demon button it means that you rate the demon levels or something so this game is so cool the steps that you can do: create levels and complete levels and do gauntlets and everything on build button. Well on building things on build button Becuase it has a tool you sure that this is the grate game you should be buying this game for real ITS SO COOL before i make hard levels and easy levels and normal levels before now I can play this is for anything check this game out for more reviews.,SOO COOL...

Also, this game takes a lot of patience. You don’t get good over night. Cause when I started, I really sucked. But now I’m at 81 demon levels complete, and 2 insane demons. About to beat my first Extreme demon. But there is some problems. 1. When I joined it had just turned update 2.0   . And now it’s update 2.1. And robtop the creator of this game has not updated it in 2 years and counting. 2. Since there are no updates the levels in geometry dash are just the same thing over and over and over again.

However, if you spend the $5 and play a little, you’ll slowly get attracted to this game. You get better and better until you beat the hardest level, Deadlocked. Your journey most likely won’t stop there. You will tap that little button on the right and be shown to the community of Geometry Dash, where people create and play each other’s levels. Some levels are extremely difficult, while others are a piece of cake. Do note, however, that this game will get you very angry, very quickly.

3,2019-01-02 08:58:14,"I love geometry dash it is My favorite game! I play it almost 24/7 Because the possibilities are endless, and you’ll never get board! The reason why I rated it 3 starts, is because The updates, Reason 1: Once an update is done it’s fun for 2 months, but then it gets old. Updates also take really long. Plus there is no description on how to use a new vehicle when one comes out. Reason 2: 2.2... Why is 2.2 taking soo long? Someone literally made a 2.2 fan game in three months, and you guys haven’t even finished 2.2?! I know it’s a little harsh, but it shouldn’t take that long. I have some advice, if you want your updates to go faster get a developer team :) Other than that Geometry dash is an amazing game, and I cannot wait to see what the Community, all the mods, RubRub, Viprin, Etzer, and Michigun has to offer next!

5,2017-07-06 21:27:07,"I'm a GD player, and while I've beaten all the main levels, the game is still really fun. Right now (as of July 2017) there are 21 main levels, while 3 are demons, which are harder than the normal levels. One you've beaten all the main levels, there's so many user levels, too! Millions of them, and some are very hard, like Bloodbath and Bloodlust. The community is also great in this game and is very interactive with other people. You can have friends, and message people, and you don't even need facebook. Just create a GD account, and that's really simple. There's also a level editor. While I've never really figured it out, it still can be fun to mess around in, make a cool level, or make the next extreme demon....",One of the best games I've ever played

I love the game and if anybody that wants to download this game but want to read the reviews, I think you should definitely download this awesome game.

5,2020-04-16 18:56:48,This is a REALLY GOOD GAME yes i have raged and possibly broke my phone before but i really like this game it has good levels of a decent difficulty on everything and the way the platform of this game is is really dang good i would probably spend the next 10 hours just playing this game and customizing my character. I really suggest you download this game if you can. Also it has a LITE  version witch is really smart and helpful to the ones you dont have the money to get this game. Theirs also other versions of the games including meltdown and subzero. Geometry dash subzero is like its own game bit just testing the 2.2 fetures its really cool. I hope when someone downloads this game they get the best experience ever. I hope RobTop keeps working on this its a teally really good game.,YES!
5,2018-04-26 20:57:44,So I discovered a glitch that won't let you open your own level even doe I was making it long and then it wouldn't let me in my own level...It took days to make this level and I was proud but when i saw this at the last day then I was so mad at this game so please fix it or I will never work on that level again :( and it happens to other levels too...The levels I could not play was the levels that when I press start then it turns black for a split second and takes me back to press start again so please RobTop try to fix this glitch please!!!!!! Btw why did you cancel the song a spark of life? It was a song that always cheers me up and now it's gone forever :( so I guess I would be sad forever (´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`),GIANT GLITCH (PLEASE READ ROBTOP!!!)
3,2019-01-06 03:45:12,"This is good game but I have some things to say... well, can you please feature the people that really waited a long time (like me and I’m named chrisywhissy) it was like my dream to get a featured level but the worst thing is that some people are waiting for a featured level THEY GET HORRIBLE COMMENTS!! So that will let them feel bad but maybe them getting their level featured will let them feel better. So please, do for us do it for me! And let the other people feel happy! But I think your probably busy but it might make other people upset so that they try their very, very best making levels so you can make them have a featured level so please do it. And another thing is... I’m making my last level because some people think my levels are useless. But I won’t quit GD if I get a featured level. Hope you do it!

5,2022-06-12 15:50:20,DUDE! WHEN I DOWNLOADED THIS GAME… I WAS SO EXITED TO PLAY IT! I saw the build button. And started making my own. After it was done I kept making more. I made one today! This game is so fun. I only had the geometry lite and now this!! This is so much better! 5 stars! I witsh the owner would comment! It would make my day. I’m at Disney and all I’ve been doing is sitting on the bed and making more! I can’t believe how good of a game this is!! If you see this and you don’t have it.. YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT! I keep making more games!!! I’m still getting use to it. Even at the pool I make more. I can’t think of what to say next! It’s just. That- I LOVE THIS! I JUST LOVE IY! I LOVE IT SO MUCHHHH! It’s so easy. Medium. HARD! HARDER! EXTREMELY HARD! EXTREME! INSANE! … I CANT EVEN SAY IT BECAUSE OF IT!! :D THANKS FOR READING THIS!!!,WHY I LOVE THIS GAMEEEE
5,2020-09-11 20:06:26,"Geometry Dash is a game that I adore and have been playing for a while. If your new to this and want to download it, then I highly recommend getting it. Reasons why: 1. It doesn’t need internet to work, so you can play basically anywhere. 2. It never gets old and is always fun. 3. You can create your own levels and games, with lots of tools and materials that can help with your great imagination, and making the final product to test out is awesome! 4. You can customize your own character or dasher, by completing levels and earning light blue gem balls, saving those hard worked crystals to buy stuff in the shop! 5.

This game has levels that you can play that get harder as you go on. There’s a bunch of different difficulties to sort levels through so you can go at your own pace and practice. Don’t listen to the people who rate this game 1 star just because they can’t pass a level. That is the players fault, not the games. The difficulty in this game is what keeps it interesting. Also, the level editor! It’s very fun to create your own levels and show them to the community! I love getting excited for new updates and I’m very excited for what 2.2 has to offer.

I’ve been playing this and that for 8 1/2 years now, (since late 2014) I have completed over 1,000 total levels (including 35 demons) in normal mode. I even completed all of the original levels! Once upon a time when I was six years old, my elementary school classmates were playing it in class during free play on tablets, my elementary school teacher wasn’t a big fan of video games, but she thought it would be fun for us!

3,2023-10-08 15:42:35,"Although I like this game, I don’t like how the creators don’t update it more often. I mean the last update was 5 years ago. And ever since the new IOS 17 came out. We havnt Ben able to play this game. The reason for this, is because Geometry Dash is a 34 bit game. And the reason you can’t open this game on IOS 17 is because IOS 17 doesn’t support 34 but games, only 64 bit games. And since they havnt updated it in 5 years, the game isn’t or can’t be 64 bit. So if the creators don’t update the game ever again. Geometry dash will soon be unplayable for all iPhone users, since they are forced to do updates. If you didn’t know, the iPhone does updates after a certain amount of time after the new IOS is out. So even if you don’t want to do the update, your iPhone will auto update when your sleeping m.",This game is good
5,2020-11-11 21:16:28,"I’m pretty sure I found out about Geometry Dash, or GD, from DanTDM and when my brother started playing it, I knew I had to get it. I recommend starting with the original levels as they do a great job of introducing you slowly to the many features of this giant game. Millions of great levels that creators have poured tens of hours into currently exist, and the possibilities are endless in the level editor. This review almost sounds suspicious because of how positive it is, but I’m trying hard to be as honest as possible and the is the result. People say Geometry Dash is dying, but every new person that downloads it makes that statement less and less true.

I’ve had the game for over four years and I don’t plan on getting rid of it. Why you may ask, because I’m patient and ready for what’s next. Don’t be focused on the last attempt. Be focused on how to improve it. Find out what you’re doing wrong piece by piece and get through it all. Mysteries, adventures, to even secret codes inside secret rooms. Including the end. A dark place that only a few people dare to go. But also different worlds other than the end. Just be careful and wise, or else the world of geometry dash’s time will be up.

4,2020-04-07 01:50:16,"Though the game is amazing, I have a little tweaks to make the game better in 2.2! First, In Gd World i got the scissors ship (which I have been wanting for along time) and I was going to save my data and load it back to the normal Gd. I got a couple diamonds and 1k orbs, but I did not get my scissors ship! So i would like to be able to transfer REWARDS from Demon Chests into Normal Gd. Also in 2.2 please add a new ground or background? Maybe consider making a new trigger to make fake blocks? Also make more types of Demons. Like a Godly Demon, or a Killer Demon! Also please make a monthly Demon, but for higher Demons like a “Monthly Killer Demon” and make a new portal for another “guy.” Finally, please make another Cube, Ship, UFO, Wave, Robot, and Spider!

5,2022-02-21 19:53:52,"This is not meant to be a hate review, so please do not take it that way. I have been playing Geometry Dash on mobile for several years and have grown quite good at the game. However, with my current iOS (15.2.1) on my generation of phone (iPhone 8), Geometry dash fails to launch whenever I attempt to open the app. If I click the icon, it shows me the usual “Robtop” intro with the blue background, but then sends me back to the Home Screen, which I am very disappointed by since it was always on of my most used apps. I have even tried deleting the app and reinstalling it. All I ask is that you consider this when writing the next update if possible. Thank you!",Bug on mobile
5,2022-01-17 19:44:44,"5 stars. End of story everything was perfect. 👍 I only have 2 complaints. 1. Whenever I created a level, and tried to upload it, the game would not let me. I suspect it might have been me being too young to have a gd account. So if thats the case, my apologies. 2. About a month ago, the app just would not open, it would get to the loading screen, and then just crash. I have not been able to play for a little over a month. And I tried deleting other apps to get storage, it didn’t work. Other than those 2 things, Robtop you have made an amazing game with so many memories to come with it! 😄👍 PS: don’t stress 2.2 I’m not mad. 👍",Tied with Minecraft for my favorite mobile game!

There’s a daily level and weekly demon, quests, map packs, and search! In the search category, you can search levels, and even Geometry Dash players!

5,2022-11-22 21:37:33,"I absolutely love this game. Played it as a kid and continue to occasionally play it even now, as an adult. I usually play it for little kids who need help beating a level or with my little cousins, but the color and effects are just spectacular. Plus, just for two bucks you get adds gone and access to new levels, gauntlets and access to unlocking better items. Overall a great game, super addictive though so if your just starting out, good luck setting down your phone. Also, if a level is too difficult just use practice mode, you may die like a thousand times but you get better over the trial and error. Anyways, yeah! I’d totally suggest downloading this game, it’s great ~",Great game
5,2021-02-14 23:48:42,Great game but there’s ALOT of bugs like I literally can’t make an account because it says my email is invalid even tho it IS my actual email and that is very annoying because I have a lot of demons icons and colors and if I loose this account I’m probably never going to forgive robtop and never play this game again and I love this game but that is very scary to think that I would loose all of my progress OVER 2 YEARS WORTH just gone. It is still literally my favorite game ever and I would highly recommend. Just make sure your email works ;).  I’m trying to search easy demons to grind on stares and it literally won’t load and it’s not my wifi because auto easy normal hard harder and insane levels will load.

5,2023-10-17 05:37:07,Hello this is a reiteration of my previous review as it seems to have disappeared. Once again I will quickly introduce myself. My name is Ray and I have played geometry dash for a long time I have beat all of the main levels with 3 coins as well as countless online levels. However the game has not been working on IOS worldwide and neither apple or robtop is doing a thing about it. This genuinely disgusts me and I can promise that if this issue is not immediately resolved there will be nothing short of the most extreme consequences for the people who have the power to easily resolve the issue but are to lazy to do anything. I would not take this lightly fix the app now.,Fix the game or else
5,2023-03-31 11:20:32,Random people: The sneak peek is so cool! When will 2.2 come out? Me: When my dad comes back with the milk. Bruh. I love this game and the fact you can build your own levels but DAWG where is 2.2 I mean seriously do you think I’d be using PuLsE triggers in EVERY SINGLE LEVEL I make?? Dawg that’s just not okay. I’d be using ZoOm triggers and stop triggers and stuff like that. 2.2 would make me such a better creator. Even though the level editor is soooooo complicating to understand and all 2.2 recent levels would be soooooo hard to sight read it would be so cool with the new level editor but ROBTOP its been 10 billion years since my dad left to get the milk and 2.2 has not been out yet.,Very good game but WHERE IS 2.2???????
5,2022-08-11 23:11:59,"So I’m aware of the bug on the game that doesn’t let you play it on apple devices. It was happening to me and i didn’t expect it to ever work again. Well, recently I got a new phone and when I sent my data from my old phone to the new one and opened GD, the game actually loaded in and I was able to play it completely fine. If you don’t have money to spend to get a brand new iPhone/iPad, I would request doing a factory reset on your device to see if that works, but highly recommended, make sure you HAVE a backup of your device, I am not responsible if you lose a bunch of stuff.

About the update, I would also agree that Geometry Dash is close to due for an update, but I know that Rob has been working on 2.2 for 3 years now, and I appreciate that he is trying to make the update the best it possibly could be.

The game is all about consistency and rhythm, and the reward is getting that perfect run out of hundreds. You spend hundreds or thousands of attempt in order to hear the whole song and see the whole level. It’s meant to give you a sense of pride and accomplishment. Imagine how boring it would be if you used practice mode to complete each level. It might seem nice at first, but then you realize you didn’t really accomplish anything, but rather sat there and crashed repeatedly for 10 minutes. It’s supposed to be difficult.

Unfortunately, without the community, this game would get stale way too soon. Updates are announced, and then the community wont hear anything for months, until which we get a picture of something that might be in the new update. Its pathetic.

5,2022-10-19 23:13:03,"Hello RobTop,  I love playing Geometry Dash, and I think it’s a pretty good game for difficulty spikes! I have it on my phone and my computer on Steam! Although, the precision seems better on computer than on my phone. Me using a mouse is better than tapping on my phone, but it’s probably the delay or something. I’ve created a level, however I feel like the standards for a rated level are WAY too extreme. It’s like decoration is favored over gameplay… and my level is in the style of 1.0 with mechanics up to 2.1. Could you change the standards for a rated level where gameplay is favored over decoration? Because if you die because of bad decoration, not many people will want to try and beat that level.  Also, on Steam, if you click on quests, or the locks on the monster the screen turns black and you have to press escape otherwise you gotta quit the game. Can you please fix that?   Overall, it’s a REALLY good game, but there’s definitely some constructive criticism that people will give (like me!).  Hopefully this humble rating could help with 2.2 or future updates.

3,2023-10-09 16:01:11,"I recently tried playing Geometry Dash, and unfortunately, I've been facing numerous crashes throughout my gameplay. It's disheartening when a game you're excited to play repeatedly interrupts your experience. The constant crashes have significantly affected my overall enjoyment and engagement with the game.  Each time I launch Geometry Dash, I find myself holding my breath, hoping that this time it won't crash. However, it seems that no matter what I do, the crashes persist. It's incredibly frustrating to be in the middle of a level, only to suddenly be thrown out of the game due to an unexpected crash.  These crashes not only disrupt the flow of the game but also undermine the progress I've made. There have been instances where I've completed challenging levels, only for the game to crash right as I open it. Crashing takes away the sense of accomplishment and makes me question whether it's worth continuing to play.  I understand that technical issues can occur in any game, but the frequency of the crashes in Geometry Dash is particularly disappointing. It feels like a missed opportunity to fully enjoy what could be an incredibly addictive and immersive game.",The game needs a bug fixed
4,2020-07-09 19:05:03,Ok so there’s this level called “Blast Processing” and I wanted to try it out. So when I was playing the level I was obviously listening to the music that goes along with it and I’m listening to the music and it was a beat I had made up in 6th grade! It’s boom clap boom clap boom clap boom clap boom boom boom boom clap boom boom boom and I was like noooo way! I’ve never played this game before and I heard that beat and said man we must have thought the same thing. Alright I gave this 4 stars because “Dry Out” is A LOT harder in difficulty then “Base after Base” which made me very made because I completed base after base still scrolling past dry out making my streak incomplete... if you could switch them that would be great but if you can’t that’s ok.

I also watched A TON of videos on how to fix it, but nothing worked. I’m also not the only person this is happening to, I read a ton of other reviews that said the same thing.

Then the spider it’s AMAZING it travels like a spider, | | | up down. Then the mini’s, the mini cube small seems like it travel’s faster (it doesn’t) then the mini ship it goes up faster and it’s harder to control.

5,2019-03-03 13:53:32,"Cool game but I want to see some more levels like a level called (THE SEVEN SEAS),(LASER DANGER),(UNDERWATER SPEED CAVE),(SPACE HAZE),And more and I want to see a race mode a multiplayer race that can go to 2 players to 30 players to see who can get a higher percentage and the winner gets 1000 orbs and a impossible mode that you have to complete the game meaning you have to kill the final boss and you have to have 15 stars and you will unlock impossible mode and you can turn it on and off a portal like jumping orb that makes you go backwards but its a portal instead of a orb a orb that acts like the portals a final boss and a five arrow.

I uninstalled the app after many attempts and reinstalled the app and it still would not open. I tried doing this process again and again. I don’t why it suddenly decided to stop working. I checked my storage on my IPhone 13 and I was good. I checked to see was my phone updated to the current version and it was. I tried to see if Geometry dash need an update but that was not the case. I’d shut off my phone multiple times and there’s still this problem. I don’t know what to rate this game because I enjoyed it for a long time and it suddenly started closing.",The game keep closing after playing for months
5,2022-03-08 04:37:58,"Geometry dash is a great game. There’s, hard levels, a good community, and an exceptional level editor. But one thing that not a lot of people talk about in their reviews is the music. First of all, this game introduced me to several new genres of music that I had never heard before. In fact, it’s probably what got me into music in the first place. Because of the great community in gd and new-grounds, I might have a chance of making music when I’m older. I have role models to look up to.  In conclusion, this game is great in many aspects, not just gaming. If you have an interest in music or just want to explore, definitely try out this game.  -TitaniumFalcon7",Might change the course of my life
5,2019-03-10 03:37:18,This game has been so hard for me but every time I keep playing and playing all I ever do is just get better at it. The levels after X Step are like starting from there I would give them a demon difficulty. Except for theory of everything and electroman adventures. Even when I keep dying and I say that I can never pass it I will not give up I will keep pushing myself just to get to the top and beat the game. Lastly this game has just been a blast for me it has such good songs to its levels and in my opinion it feels a lot better and harder then the impossible game. Thank you so much RobTob games for making me have this much fun in this game I hope you keep making a lot more games like this one.,Geometry Dash
1,2023-11-01 23:02:38,"I just got the game and I was so excited to play it because I heard that is was really good but when I opened the game it took me right out of it tried re-downloading it but it still not work. I have a terrible experience and at the end I didn’t even think if I got a refund or not because I was so mad if you guys are interested in downloading this app, I recommend to make sure that your other apps work too my other app working perfectly, but this one just wouldn’t, let me in the game if you want to download this app it’s your choice just make sure you know what you’re getting into. Don’t pay two dollars for nothing and it will not even open after that 17 iOS update please fix this now a lot of customers are angry if you have new iPhone 15 like me then do not buy this. It will not work because it will not load at all for the 17. update. Fix this now please",Terrible 💔💔💔
5,2023-07-15 17:43:36,"Worth the price. Very fun, started playing when I was 9. There is so many options to choose, and in 2.2 there will be even more and I can’t wait! I couldn’t sync my progress before but it was because I had 200+ levels lol. I deleted most of them, and guess what! It worked! I was able to sync my data! So if u have a problem where you can’t sync your data, just delete most of your levels that you don’t want.  You can make your own level and you might get it featured by Robtop!  Although it can get bored sometimes, you can always do the daily challenges (levels). WARNING(joke): don’t look at daily chat. 😅",Best platformer-cube game EVER! I RECOMMEND IT!

Please do fix this bug though as it is restricting not only mine, but lots of other peoples experiences of playing and exploring this amazing game. I love everything else about this game and would definitely recommend if you do not have iOS 15. Please fix this bug Robtop, and I hope 2.2 is still on the way.

5,2022-05-21 06:59:10,Really really fun game but for some reason it won’t let me enter the game all of a sudden. I have been playing this game for months but one day it wouldn’t let me open my daily rewards chests it would just keep loading and loading until it just said something went wrong. So I just ignored it but a few weeks later it just stopped letting me play altogether. If I click the app it says the blue geometry dash load screen but after about 2 seconds it bring me back to my phones Home Screen. Anyways really weird bug I’m connected to wifi every time I play so idk what’s up but if you guys could fix it that would be amazing ty!!!😁👍,Won’t let me enter game
5,2020-10-30 16:59:55,"I love this game to pieces and it’s my favorite mobile game, but I do believe that there needs to be a few things that would make the game even better. For example they should add a endless mode to the game. I don’t know if you would just play through the original levels and see how far you get until you die, or if they would do something like Mario maker were you choose a difficulty and then you just see how far you get with randomly picked user levels, based on what difficulty you chose. I think that would add a lot of replay ability by trying to beat your high score or just seeing how far you can make it.",I love this game but...
5,2020-09-22 01:07:11,"So the bugs started about one or one and a half weeks ago. So the first one is when I go to my daily chests I can’t load them, when I click on my account icon, I can’t load it, when I search for a level I want to play, I CAN’T LOAD IT! I don’t know if it has to do with the 2.2 update but it’s very frustrating. The second bug isn’t really a bug bug, but it’s still kind of weird. So when I’m in wave sections and mini wave sections, the wave trail starts wiggling and going all over my screen. Again, I don’t know if it has to do with the 2.2 update but it’s very frustrating. Other than that my rating for this game is 5 stars. Love the game and I can’t wait for the 2.2 update!!!",I’m having bug problems...

I have had very many issues that completely ruin the game for me, such as sound issues or your game crashing. Also, geometry dash has been recently been taking several years to make a big update to the game, mainly because geometry dash is updated and coded by only one person. Geometry dash is also a very difficult game. It is very easy to rage when playing, which really isn’t the developers fault but is annoying. Even though this is true, geometry dash is a very fun game.

5,2022-09-20 03:12:46,"Love it. It’s a fast-paced play forming rhythm music game which in my opinion is really fun. Though people say it could be frustrating… the music tracks will calm you and keep you going as the further you go into the game the more intense it gets. The Awesomeness of this game comes into three things that made me love it so much… the Music, the Difficulty options, and last… the level maker god I loved this feature, it makes it so if you are into video games and music and you wanna take your favorite song and make something amazing out of it then GO FOR IT!!!

This has been happening to me since the game came out and I started playing it which was a long time ago. Please fix this constant bug because it's very annoying. I had gotten 94% an Hexagon Force because of his constant situation. This happens to my friends and they do not like it. I love this game but I can't play it when this is contantly.

This trash game hasn’t worked in 3 years for me now. 3 freaking whole years!!! I only played it because I used to like it when I was younger, but it’s getting so annoying and it’s just so stupid how I have to try to re download it each year again, and again, and again just to see that it wont let me in. It’s just kinda stupid I’ve was so eager to re download this game today. Once I did, it still didn’t freaking work. What’s happening is that when I press on the app, it shows me the screen for 2 SECONDS. And then it kicks me out. I’m not trying to be rude in any way, but please fix this.

5,2021-10-30 21:33:01,"GD is a VERY awesome game. I finally bought this version that includes a lot of things. New levels and demons. Clubstep, Electrodynamix, Hexagon Force, Blast Proccessing (I don’t know how to spell it) ToE 2, Geometrical Dominator, Deadlocked, and Fingerdash. But we must change ratings. First of all, Cycles must be rated Insane. Electrodynamix must be a demon level. Blast Proccessing and Geometrical Dominator, I do not understand why they are in “Harder” Category. Demons must be rated in order. Like, Clubstep should be easy demon, ToE two must be rated Medium demon and Deadlocked a hard demon.  I don’t think Fingerdash should have changes.  Except that the music sounds like: Oh, Nuggets, speak of your wii, begin, haunt Anyways, this is a Great game PLEASE MAKE TOE 3!!!",Level Rating
5,2020-03-22 22:20:26,I love this game and I really enjoy playing and practicing on levels and online levels a lot! I even like if there’s challenges but there is one problem. It’s that people create levels and they have to wait to see if the moderator sees it and rate the level THEN it would be featured which is kinda unfair for example: the person crates a hardest level ever but you need to verify and get the coins which is impossible to do and after so much attempts you finish but can’t think of a title because people already have a name for their level and then if you think of a name then you have to wait for a while until the moderator sees it.

The first geometry dash game I played was subzero and I did remember seeing swing copter mode in the color menu but it vanished later on. The mode is not used much but from what I can tell from geometry dash videos, it was used in the level “dash”. And looking at it for a while, you’d know that it’s and easy or medium demon. That is a good accomplishment but I just wonder what happened to it. I guess I don’t even know how to control it anyway but it’s like ship mode but 3 engines and different controls.

5,2020-01-26 08:58:56,"These are ideas, that I believe, could or should be added inside of a later update of GD.   Side Orbs/Portals - These will turn the screen sideways, like the backwards portals. It will start making you go upwards, making you be able to create either cool platformers (as seen in a RobTop YT video) or just cool rotating levels overall.  Now,  Rotating Orbs/Portals - These will slowly rotate the screen, depending on speed. You will be set going around kind of like a circle, making great ship parts or just regular cube parts. These could make demons easier to make, as straight flying while rotating may seem hard to some people.  These ideas are all my own, and I don’t know if there is something on Steam that has talked about these ideas and I’m not original, but I will try and come up with new ideas for possible gameplay and editor features for GD.  Otherwise, this game is wonderful, full of fun, and it will make you coming back for more EVERDAY. I have played every day for at least 15% of my day.

There could also be a new gauntlet like a Love gauntlet, Glitch gauntlet, and maybe a Earth gauntlet. Those are pretty much the only ideas I have so on to the *help*. So for some reason when I am playing it randomly starts slowing down and then speeding up and it makes it hard to time jumps and stuff. Also it doesn’t let me post levels or look at the high score or look at someone’s account so I tried refreshing and it didn’t work so I was gonna email support but it didn’t let me do that.

I have been playing for 2 years, almost three, and I still only have 16 demons. It’s not about mobile vs. steam, it’s about putting in the time and actually trying or just hating the game and breaking your devices. Actually try, or just don’t play the game.

Your not going to play this game without getting a classic case of video game fever... you know when you hands are sweating, just slight movements in your fingers cause a chain reaction throughout your whole body to jolt! I remember playing this game when I was young and I’d try out one of the harder levels, I’d play it for half an hour and be in tears... but with all the anger you are sure to experience, you must get this game! And no matter how good you get, the game really has an unlimited skill ceiling thanks to the user made levels!  For short... get it.",The Mario of the 20th Century
3,2020-06-26 09:57:06,Don’t get me wrong this game is awesome. Being able to play a game to great songs made by amazing people dedicating their time into a level is amazing... However the community is becoming more aggressive and filling with negative people. Account hacks are also becoming more present within the community. The game has also slowed a significant amount with all the iconic creators moving on and not enough new people to take their place. It’s also very aggravating to see updates being “hyped” and “announced” but never released. It is in a way pushing away its fan base and I feel like that could be avoided. I personally have been playing very sporadically because every level is becoming the same and I find it very annoying that the updates are held back for such a long period of time.,Concerns about the future.
5,2019-06-28 00:26:02,"This has been a game I’ve loved and been astounded by for most of my young life, and it never ceases to amaze me with it’s simplicity yet how difficult (and frustrating) it can be, although these two facts are what makes the game so great. Never have I in my life found a game so simple yet so difficult. All the game is, is tapping along to wonderfully picked songs, nothing else. Despite this, the game is still entertaining and never ceases to be my #1 time-waster. I highly recommend this game to anyone, and the $1.99 this game costs is very much worth it. Thank you developers so much for creating this incredible game that I have played for years and will likely play for years to come. Cheers!",Absolutely Amazing
5,2017-01-22 17:11:51,"It's finally here, and it definitely delivered. I love the new mechanics, secret areas, new currency, and how the game sort of has a ""plot"" and characters now. This totally deserves a 5 star, but I'm having some issues. The Lost Gauntlets have not ever been able to load (which I'm not sure if that's supposed to happen, but if it is than disregard this comment), sometimes the game completely crashes and I lose whatever progress I made in that session, and sometimes online levels, profiles, quests, and leaderboards just don't load at all. It's honestly not that big of a deal, but I'm sure others are having these problems as well.   P.S, does anybody smell burning chicken?",2.1..... Love it Rubrub!
5,2023-08-08 05:37:12,Absolutely amazing partly because it’s hard like getting over it which I love and once you get skilled enough to start conquering easy and medium demons it gets real fun but difficult which is why I love it I also love spending 2433 ATTEMPTS ON A FRICKIN MEDIUM DEMON AND ONLY GETTING 64% but in all seriousness if you don’t wanna spend hundreds of hours and just spend half a year when you first start to beat stereo madness like me when I started it’s not for you so it’s a great rage game or it could be easy after spending a year of playing and dying to absolutely everything you can die to before you get skilled,Amazing if you love raging and spending hundreds of hours on it
5,2022-10-11 23:18:31,"This game. THIS GAME. Is so wonderful and SO SO FRUSTRATING at the same time. I have been playing this game since a year or two ago i think. This game is hard. Easy mode sometimes is not easy. So insane. Is like impossible at times. But, the levels, are flippin amazing. The MASTERPIECES some of these creators make are INSANE. and the music SLAPS. Robtop, be proud, and the rest of your team, well, if you made this game by yourself or not. This game is hard, fun, head bopping show stopper. And i cant get enough. P.S the editor has so much to build with. SO MUCH. Its can get confusing. But once you get the skill, you can be the Michelangelo of GD. THANK YOU ROBTOP",I play on my phone but im just gonna review it on my ipae
5,2020-11-12 09:58:33,"GD is a great game to play on me mobile devices. Some of the problems I’ve been running into is, the level maker not including the things you made(I managed to figure it out) and my email being invalid for some reason. I’ve been using that email for years so I KNOW it’s not invalid. It’s impossible to sign in and I really wanna put my levels online. Has anybody else’s email been assumed invalid, because I haven’t read any reviews saying that it is? On to the good things. Even though I can’t post levels, I can still see other levels made by other people! I really cannot believe how good this game is and I’m really exited for the next update, 2.2 a lot!",That’s my email though...
5,2020-04-17 15:07:41,"One of the best games ever I like the user interface how you can both make and try levels made by REALPEOPLE and if your offline you can play the levels that come with the game plus if you don’t want to spend money this amazing developer has I believe 4 or 5 games for free meltdown,world,subzero,and lite for free plus I do think there may be one more game. All the games are amazing and as I stated before my favourite game and it’s only 2 dollars for such a great game. It can be frustrating but there are levels that are rated Auto so you can get the calm factor and not die. I do think there should be more updates but not so much where it’s constant.  Overall great game worth it and fun",Amazing game worth it!!!!
5,2023-01-22 03:41:31,"Hi Rob, so I have a couple of things. 1: so I created a level and verified it but it won’t let me upload it, I don’t know if it is the game or if it’s something I did wrong. 2: the keys to unlock the demon are hard to get, may I suggest that their are multiple ways to get some of the hard keys? 3: the level clutterfunk is way too hard, and I have already beaten theory of everything and have almost beaten electroman adventures both multiple times, I suggest making it easier. Other than that this is an absolute masterpiece, and I recommend anyone who reads this review to immediately download the game(if they want to of course :) )",The review
4,2021-11-05 22:36:19,This game is really good and I enjoy playing it I was thinking about you adding an update where if you left of at 70% and you closed the app or you died you could go back to 70% instead of starting over at 1%. I really do enjoy this game but it kind of gets obnoxious when you are at let’s say 96% and you have to start back again at 1% instead of being able to continue. With this update I was also thinking that you can add a button that asks them if they want to start over or continue from the percent that they were at. Once again I really do enjoy it this game but it’s really annoying when you have to restart and your so close to beating it.,New Update
5,2022-06-26 21:33:10,"Geometry Dash is a very fun game to play when you’re bored. It’s like the Impossible Game but with different game modes, a level editor, 21 unique official levels, custom online levels by the community, “map packs”, character customization, an entire storyline, and more! Keep in mind that this game only cost a few dollars, and you can never stop playing this game. You can start with level 1 -which is still ridiculously hard - and then, when you improve, you can play the painfully difficult “Demon” rated levels! If you have a couple dollars and are bored, I would 100% recommend this game.","Very fun game, for only a few dollars."
3,2022-02-08 08:55:07,"I used to have an iPad which could run GD perfectly fine a few years ago, but ever since it broke, I've been left with a phone with IOS 15. Recently, I bought this game so i could re-experience the memories of creating levels, raging after dying at 2% on Bloodbath, and more. But like countless other unsuspecting people, I teared up after realizing I couldn't play my childhood game which I had and loved for years. RobTop, even though you probably won't see this because you're doing anything but working on 2.2, at least PLEASE fix the IOS 15 bug! I wasted my money on this game, thinking I would finally experience this wonderful game again. But I was scammed. (No wonder everyone buys this from Steampowered now lol)",I never knew about IOS 15 crashing GD...
4,2019-12-19 17:04:29,Add a swimming player if stop tapping you fall in the 2 block shallow water if fall 1.5 blocks down you die if you hit a bouncer you go up and jump also the world creator explained in my world review I would 2.2 and also make a demon level for the normal levels if get all built in achievements you get custom color add the songs from the other games and levels to this one also make a new game geometry dash rush after all this it picks a random story level from this game and gives 1 day to beat it who ever beats it fastest and in the least amount of time gets the top of a leader board you get trophies and characters from your performance that’s all check out my other reviews please thanks,Ok this is my big features review for 5 stars
4,2022-05-07 22:12:29,"This game is great not because of the main game, but the community levels. There are so many amazing levels you can play, and you never run out. This makes for the fact that Rob hasn’t released 2.2 in 5 years… 😑  Anyway, I also love the create mode, it really lets people make whatever they want. But I have some problems with this game. I have this bug on iOS in which the music stops working when I leave the game and I have to close and reopen the game to make it work again. There are so many limits on things that are unnecessary, like comments and level names. If these issues get fixed in 2.2, lol not gonna happen, this could be a 5 star game.",Great Game with some Issues
5,2018-02-15 02:00:50,"GD is great. There are so many possibilities and so many secrets (still can’t get the first key, but I have the second and third 😢). I have so much to do in this game. I’m constantly trying to get further in levels such as in the Chaos Gauntlet, and I’m trying to improve my levels to make them better and fun, and I love the feeling of accomplishment when I finish an XL level. This game can give you something to do WHENEVER you want, wether you wanna beat a level you already have, make a level, beat a new level, or finally complete that one custom level that you can’t beat because of the wave part.  We’re all waiting for 2.2 while saying “2.1 finally!”  -GD player Zoroark21 (GD name)",Love it!
4,2021-11-11 01:47:38,I’ve played this game since the hardest level was Time Machine and have loved it ever since. I bought the full Version recently and played almost 2 hours a day. This game is so fun and will always have a place In my heart for me.   But I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I’m dealing with a glitch right now that’s been affecting the game for me for about a month now. I will open the app only for it to close when loading in. Please Robtop read my review and fix this problem because I really enjoy your game and want to keep playing. Everything else in this game is extremely fun and would love for this problem to be fixed so I can play it again. Thanks!,Best addictive mobile game EVER!
5,2021-02-02 01:05:23,So since I just got some money on my phone I obviously went I. The App Store to find some games to buy. The second game I ended up getting that cost any money was this very game. I bought it still being a huge fan of the lite version of geometry dash and trying to see what the full version had to offer. I fell in love with the full version instantly! I have beaten stereo madness to jumper so far and it has been an amazing experience. I also found out that with the full version you can actually make your own levels and see other levels people around the world have made to! I totally recommend this game to anyone who comes across it.,I LOVE this game!!!!!
5,2020-07-21 17:29:16,"Here are some ideas for update 2.2: 1. Green and black jump pads. Since you can put jump pads in midair, it would work. Without these jump pads, it might be hard to make auto versions of levels with green and black jump rings. I think it would also be nice if there were dash pads (jump pad versions of the green and pink dash orbs). 2. Mega portal. If we’ve had a mini portal since update 1.4, why not make a mega portal? 3. Dash orb path. I know that you can use ramps or blocks/triggers to control the path of a dashing cube, ship, ball, etc. but it would be easier if you just had to click “special edit” and draw a line in the editor, which is the path that the icon would follow.",Ideas for 2.2
5,2017-11-30 00:24:33,You know the games that you have played with your friends and you realize you want it?!?! This is definitely one of the few that you will delete your favorite games if you don't have enough storage!! Lol🤣🤣 Anyways this game is the worlds best game and has updates for new levels and such frequently all of amazing features. If you are not sure if you want the game they have GD-Meltdown GD-world and a lite version if you don't want to pay. GD-Lite comes with the first 10 levels and icons and colors. GD full version comes with 22 or so levels and online game play to play your friends levels. It even comes with level creator to create your own or edit your friends level!!!!!,BEST GAME EVER
5,2017-11-18 16:22:52,"Now I know what you’re thinking, This game is so hard! But patience is a virtue and it takes time and effort to get pretty good at it (coming from a player who has played for quite a while) Plus the levels and the music is amazing. I could literally listen to Clutterfunk forever, some things I would like to suggest in the next update is a collaboration mode, yes it is possible to collaborate in the game but it is pretty complex, so a collaboration mode would be nice. Also I love 2.11 , there are some bugs but other than that is amazing! I cannot wait for 2.2 and the continuation of the story of geometry dash. If RobTop is reading this, keep up the good work with your awesome game!",Best Mobile app ever!
5,2023-03-04 15:18:29,"This is the BEST game I have ever played, and I mean it. There’s just one thing you should know before u get it. GD is currently broken on my device because… well it’s kinda weird, I was checking if 2.2 was out, and then I saw an update button. Although, I checked the latest update and it said 2.1.1., so I knew it actually wasn’t out. But just for fun I hit update anyway, and ever since that, when I try to go into the game, it crashes. I know it will work again when 2.2 is out, but basically, DON’T press update unless u know It’s for 2.2. Other than that it is a great game get it NOW",Da BEST game but there’s a glitch (read this it’s important)
1,2023-08-15 21:13:23,"Geometry Dash is a really good game, but as someone who likes to poke around in the negative reviews, here are some pointers for people wanting to leave a bad review and not sound like a kid who’s angry they don’t know how to play games.  - If the music isn’t working, your ringer might be off. Sometimes it might not work if you leave the app while it’s playing then come back, simply entering or exiting a level should get it back.  - Don’t give the game a negative review because it’s too hard and don’t ask Robtop to make it easier or else you’ll kill him. Just admit you’re salty about being bad at the game, or git gud scrub.  - If hard games make you rage to the point you’ll chuck your phone or iPad to the wall, please don’t play this game, this game was not made for you. Go play Kirby instead, really good easy games that won’t make you destroy expensive technology.  - I’ve been around in the critical reviews and they’ve been talking about some kind of crash that won’t allow them to play the game. I’ve heard that it’s a problem if your iPhone is on update 15+ but I just updated my phone to 16 and the game seems to work just fine. I’m not too sure about this one. The game crashing is a valid criticism though, ya’ll can have this one.",The game is good.
5,2023-01-13 23:14:39,It has been six years since we’ve gotten an update you’ve been working on 2.2 for six years please I really want just an early release on like January 20 that’s all I’m asking but either way it’s really really fun and I really like it so really I am asking is that 2.2 needs to need to it has been six years since we’ve gotten an update you’ve been working on 2.2 for six years please I really want just an early release on like January 20 that’s all I’m asking but either way it’s really really fun and I really like it so really I am asking is that 2.2 needs to come out it’s been so long since we have an update,2.2 isn’t here yet

1,2021-06-26 04:59:24,"My progress wont save and I have no idea why. Recently I discovered that when I saved my account it just says “backup failed try again later.” I tried changing my password, fixing my router, deleting excess levels, and I tested whether or not I could backup to cloud on other apps. The other apps could save my data. After realizing my account was going to be reset to the last save I made I tried to upload my most recent level to make a copy. It just says “upload failed please try again later.” The level I spent two months making is going to disappear as well as 1000 stars and over 100 user coins. I can’t even post an update on my profile because even that says something went wrong.

Thankful that you created this app. how matter people get upset either one they’re finishing hard levels and I don’t get that much angry. It’s just my practice. like who would be angry if someone delete this app and write one star and I like when you guys make this app edible but gladly no ads honestly this is the app that I love only 😂 this app is the only thing to help my level skills as  Back on track  Stereo madness  Time Machine  Jumper.

I’ve redownloaded geometry dash multiple times and done all the steps it said when I look it up, but every time I try to open the app, it instantly closes, I dont know if it’s because of something that I’m doing somehow, or if it’s just a bug, but other than that as far as actual gameplay goes it’s 10/10 and it’s a great game, I just wish I knew how to fix this bug so I could play it again, especially since it’s on all of the geometry dash games, not just the normal one.","Love the game, but having a bug"
5,2020-11-10 16:32:50,"So I personally love Geometry Dash. Full version or not. It kinda pained me that I realized I haven’t played GD in a year. So I got the full version (and lite) installed. It was so refreshing to just come back after playing all those popular games, Fortnite, Minecraft and Rocket League. It was pretty nostalgic 😅 But I only have one little complaint. I don’t know if this is some glitch or my phone is acting weird but, I cannot hear any music whatsoever.  And that’s pretty bad, considering music is one of the core things of GD. Especially when I want to make a level with good music. Maybe it’s just my phone, but if this is a glitch please fix it and make 2.2 epic!","Amazing game, just have a problem"

Like it doesn’t even take 1 second to say upload failed please try again later. It’s verified to. I tried it 100 times but it won’t work! So I thought oh I must need a account. So I went to create a account and it said email invalid. So I checked my email and there was no spelling errors, so I did it again, but it still said invalid.

5,2019-07-16 04:09:15,"This app is so fun and has good music and is a great way to waste time. I love all of the levels that they give you and have beaten all of them after hundreds of attempts. Each level is so unique and it is so fun to unlock new icons and get through all of the gauntlets. All of that is fun and I haven’t even mentioned the level editor part. It is so fun to create cool levels that go along with the music and be anything you want them to be. Sometimes if you feel like only being a rocket ship, then you can easily make a level that is purely a rocket ship level. It is so fun and once you get good at it, you can compete with friends and do so many cool things.",Best app ever
5,2017-10-25 02:49:12,"This game has the best graphics ever! The levels are action packed with all of the squares, rocket ships, balls, waves, etc. The level editor is the best part of it. You see levels and you say to yourself, ""Wow! I wonder how they make these levels truly be awesome!?"" And then you see the level editor and say, ""What the heck!?"" I love the fact that you can get tons of icons from The Shop and there are so many levels to complete to get icons; you can also get them from unlocking achievements. There are so many colors to choose from. It's pretty cool that you can get such a wide array of colors. P.S. I hoped you enjoyed my review and keep your eyes peeled for new updates. :)",Incredible game!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,2017-01-26 23:18:00,"A major new part of 2.1 among many things are the new orb and diamond currency. I am on the boarder between being really good. I have beaten 3 demon levels and there is no way I could re-beat them. With 2.1 ALL OF THE ORBS AND DIAMONDS DO NOT COUNT. All the work on demon levels and all levels does not convert if it did I would have access to a lot more parts of the game.

5,2023-06-22 20:12:47,"Geometry dash is a great game, and 2.2 is so close!  There’s a lot I could see them change, and also have some opinions on what they should change.  Geometry dash on console would be epic playing Geometry Dash on the PS5!  Now I know, many people have asked for it, likely is a joke, but I mean it.  I mean, controller would be great for geometry dash, and on platformer mode in 2.2 it would make more of a Mario kind of feeling.  It would also be cool just to hook up a controller to a phone/computer and play it on that, but with controller.  I’d love that feature, and wouldn’t hesitate to get it.  I Hope Robtop will see this and take some notes.",Great game!
5,2023-01-29 15:15:31,"So the game is amazing (albeit i cant beat daily levels because im trash) but i have 3 suggestions. 2 are about practice mode. 1 & 2: Practice mode should have an ability for things like speed changer, noclip, ignore damage (like the editor), and possibly other things from the megahack mod that only affect the current level, while in exchange still not being able to hear the normal music for the stage. 3: there should be an option to change your screen safe area so no buttons overlap with anything like the camera or just go off the screen thanks to a case or something.",i have 3 suggestions
4,2020-08-11 00:51:58,"I really like the game a lot, and I’m really good at it. But when I played Can’t let go I died at 97% because they put a troll in it, I’m sure. For some reason, when I get to that part, it just slows down and I jump to early and die. There was nothing there, and it was SUPER annoying because I kept dying on the exact same spot. I don’t know if this happens to other people, but I don’t like it. In general, I think it is one of the best games on mobile, and that everyone should play it, but constantly my game freezes or lags a lot when I’m trying to enter gauntlets or map packs. I hope you can fix this, cause it is happening too often now.",Liked the game at first.
5,2022-02-05 00:40:14,"I never was really into geometry until I played geometry dash lite, it was just great to play a more basic but difficult game but I had issues with it like having ads a lot in the game and just more restrictions than the other geometry games so I decided to get the paid version and let me just tell you, it was just unspeakable like you had all that great geometry design but now you get unlimited attempts in the game without any ads and many restrictions just disappeared only for 1.99$! Like what!!! Overall I think this is the best geometry dash and will entertain many people.",Just Amazing (Plz read the description)
5,2021-10-09 02:16:22,"Geometry Dash I darn good. It has a pretty small assortment of levels, but each level gets more difficult than the last, and you’ll eventually find yourself working on one level for weeks. But when you complete a level, you feel really good about yourself. There’s no margin for error in this game, so it can be frustrating sometimes. I also don’t recommend this game to someone with an old device, since if the game lags, you instantly fail. However, the artwork is great, and the levels are fun and keep you going for a while, so I give this game a 9/10.",A game that we can all appreciate
5,2021-03-24 00:53:47,"I love the game RobTop! I’ve made an account and everything has worked so far. But there is one bug that messes me up a bit. When I sync my data from my account to another account and whenever I save my data, I wait 10 minutes and then it says Backup Failed. Please try again later. It’s not a really bad bug but if it worked I would be happy because then I could use multiple accounts with the same data. Everything in this game is really cool but there is that bug and other bugs like taps sometimes don’t register but you can clean your screen and fix it. Great game but there are some bugs.",Great Game but some bugs
4,2019-12-26 03:25:48,"I have beaten a lot of the levels in the game, but I keep coming across a few problems. One is in Clutterfunk, during the ball part where you have to jump on 3 blue orbs, I always hit the first one but when I go up I end up dieing Because apparently I hit the orb too late. I have made it past the part but it still frustrates me. The same thing happens a lot on Fingerdash except it happens when I’m on the second blue orb sending me towards the yellow orb. I turn up too short. Another problem I’m sure nobody can fix is that sometimes when I tap the screen, it doesn’t let me jump or fly up/down. Other than those problems the game is awesome. Keep up the good work.",Really good fame but just a few problem
5,2018-12-31 14:51:49,"This game. Is a gift from the gods ITS SO ADDICTING and you know most games have like ads and I game purchases NOPE This game doesn’t have none of that it doesn’t just throw an ad in your face while playing And the best part. You can play other pepoles LEVELS!!!!!! If you get mad or stuck on a part you can just go do a different level! And I also love the icon customization just use your imagination to create a awesome looking icon. There’s also. Daily Levels, weekly levels, gauntlets, And. A level editor. Yes you read me. A level editor And More! And only 2 Dollars!! Totally recommend 5 stars! Oh and robtop take your time for updates anyway if you don’t have this GET IT",WORTH IT!
5,2017-06-16 02:50:20,"This gameーit is like no other. This game, Geometry Dash, may not be the most original when it comes to concept, but when it comes to delivery and gameplay, no other game could surpass it. I discovered this game about two and a half years ago, and really got into the game last year. After playing for hours on end during the summer, school arrived. Once school arrived, my grades dropped dramatically and stayed down all year. When it comes down to it though, the game is great, but it is too good. The game is so fun and addictive that it nearly ruined my life. I advise youーdo not juggle Geometry Dash and any big responsibilities, you will rank in quality in both.",Game Too Good
5,2023-07-25 23:35:09,Hey there RobTop 😀. I just want you to know that I love your game so much. Sadly I have only gotten to play the lite version. The problem is that when I click on the game for normal geometry dash it shows the RobTop logo then exits the game then goes back to Home Screen. 😩😩😩😩. I want to play so bad. My friend had the same problem. Please please please please fix this. I love your game soooo much. You did an exceptional job with the creation. Great imagination and ideas. Just please fix this. I would be so great full. I will forever support you guys. Thanks so much for this game. Hopefully I can hear from you guys and thank in advance.😊😇🙂,Love this game but…
2,2023-03-18 00:01:43,"Geometry Dash is a great game that is super fun to play. I’d give it five stars. If they updated it. You see, the game hasn’t updated in more than five years leaving the people with the current iOS unable to play the game. If you try launching the app, it will kick you out, no matter how many times you try again. This isn’t the same for all the other Geometry Dash games that update frequently but it just doesn’t seem fair that just because the free version is more successful means that they don’t care about this one. Because now the people that spent their money on this game have wasted that money and all the mobile Geometry Dash players out there can’t access the extra levels that come with this version. Please RobTop. We need an update soon.",Not Updated 💀💀💀
5,2022-12-01 03:56:44,"One day, I wanted to play geometry dash on my iPad, but when I opened the game it automatically crashed I tried it with subzero, world, and meltdown, but none of them worked! To this day, I still can’t play GD on this device. However, I can still play it on a newer tablet. I can also play it on my iPhone, but whenever I open it up on my iPhone the music just doesn’t play, my music in the in-game settings is turned all the way up, but it’s just silent. For some reason, though, the sfx still works without any issues. If these issues can be fixed, please do so!",There’s glitch for my devices
5,2022-04-02 13:54:30,"To all those people who says it started crashing for no reason, Its IOS 15. Mine still works, even though I’m on IOS 15.3. Basically, something with IOS broke it. I think I know what. For anybody having this issue, notice how with IOS 15, There was more Apple Watch support. If my theory is correct, by turning off Bluetooth, you can play it. I think for just a second, It’s trying to connect to an Apple Watch that does not exist. Geometry Dash cannot handle that. I’m not 100% sure this works tho. If not, I am 99% sure this will be fixed when 2.2 comes out, probably between now and the end of 2023.",IMPORTANT
5,2021-12-01 02:20:23,"In my personal opinion this game is a masterpiece! I have 727.4 hours in the game (yes I have problems) and have loved it every step of the way! Its a very simple premise but it does take actual skill, especially the harder levels (demons is what they are called in game.) you just tap to jump and avoid spikes. Simple but very entertaining. I recommend this to everyone except one group of people… if you rage at games easily NEVER play this. It is very frustrating because of the difficulty. especially to those who get angry easily. I hope this review helped you out, and I have you have a great rest of your day! ☺️",Great game!
5,2021-04-18 12:44:51,"Ok, so I don’t see an option to download a level to play offline. (A level you found online) because there is a GD x JSAB level to the song of Peer Gynt that is utterly AMAZING! So if I could download it I would love that, also, I’m also wondering how the heck it’s not featured, the guy prob worked so hard.  Like the music so far! I hope we get an official level to the song peer gynt. Like the simple gameplay too.  2.2 is probably close to finished or at least in the debugging stage. If we got it now there would be bugs GALORE. Stop asking for the update to magically appear instantly, things take time. Especially when only one person is doing that thing.  OKAY QUICK UPDATE. Could you add the subzero meltdown and world levels to the “full” version of geometry dash? Cause I like the rewards for the level press start. Also. I’d like to see a way to at least transfer data using accounts. Ok that’s the end of the update.  (Can’t let go is getting me stuck I’m probably skipping to jumper.)  Bye!",Just one thing.
4,2019-06-30 15:48:54,"The game is great fun and I recently got into it. You see, the I would rate the game 5 stars, but the game takes forever to be updated by RobTop. Also, the community is a little bit iffy, unlike it was was during the 1.9 era. Also in 1.9 RobTop used to work hard pushing many updates out. Still, there are lots of good creators out in Geometry Dash which makes the game fantastic. If you just got a Apple Gift card, I recommend you buy the full version of Geometry Dash, because the lite version is missing out on to much such as, Missing Main Levels, No Shops, No Creator Tab (the Creator tab is where the Treasure Room is, the Vault of Secrets, User Coins, User Levels, Daily Levels, Weekly Demons, Map Packs, and more. 4 Stars from me.","Great Game, Lazy Creator."
5,2019-04-19 15:47:46,This game really does just deserves 5 stars. I got this game around 3 years ago and I still haven’t stoped playing it. It’s almost addictive to make your own levels and share them with your friends. And I love how rob top is always experimenting with new concepts and always looking to improve the game. Also you don’t get board of the gameplay because there are secret vaults you can unlock and gauntlets. Even if you get board of that there’s thousands of online levels that are uploaded everyday that you can play. I really recommend this game to anyone who is looking to kill time or just to have fun! It’s really worth the 2 bucks!  -Benjamin,This game is amazing
4,2017-01-20 01:41:32,"I really did want to give geometry dash 5 stars, but I couldn't being myself to so it untill robtop fixes the glitch where when I click on my account it says an error occured, and I get the same message when I try to back-up the game, load old cloud save, in the gauntlets, and asks me to get an account when I go to the friends section in the scores area. I have been playing for about a year or two, and I absolutely LOVE 2.1, don't get me wrong, but I really think that Lord RubRub should pull his act together and get GD back to the point of being clear of almost all bugs. Really believe me when I say, I love GD, but I really hope these problems are fixed soon.","Very Good, A Few Bug Fixes And It Would Be Perfect"
5,2018-06-07 20:41:18,"This is the best and most addictive game ever! Hundreds upon hundreds of user created lvls, and tens of developer created lvls. Gauntlets and maps packs, secrets and more secrets! There is just so much to see and do that you can’t do it one day. It’s taken me a long time to “get good”, and I still haven’t gotten all there is to get.     While there is a few bad things, like a lot of the community, there is so much that is awesome. Yes, it takes a while to figure out the lvl editor, but once you do, you can make amazing lvls. They may even get featured, or the elusive epic.   All in all, this is one game that is worth your money. I highly recommend.👍🏻 but when will 2.2 come out?",Best game ever
5,2017-12-29 21:45:10,"You can play this game for hours and never get bored. it’s been about 2 years since I’ve started, and I’m still going. It’s SUPER satisfying to get better, unlock more skins, and complete levels. I also love how you can create your own levels, and how many options you have to create a level. You will never get bored, because there are hundreds of thousands of levels to explore, and if you don’t know what to search up, you can play gauntlets, level packs, and the campaign.  Everybody I know plays it, and I play it everyday. I suggest this game to everybody who is looking for a game. Thank you Robtop for the great content you’re brought us. 😀👌",I LOVE this game
5,2017-05-13 20:52:57,"I just love the game because you get to try tons of vehicles, go through tons of lvls by users, and soon SLAP YATA IN DA FACE! Also, I really love 2.1, but I wish there was an option for the 2.0 editor. The 2.1 editor is sometimes confusing. Also here's something weird... I think that deadlocked is easier than ToE2 & clubstep. Although I watch way more ppl play deadlocked so I get farther in it. If u have an acc u can interact, save & load. I really enjoy it a lot. Right now I'm working on problematic. Also u get to create! My favorite part! I've done so much with my creating career! I even got 2 icons when getting 100 likes! I really love the game & I highly recommend it! :)",Greatest game ever! 😁
5,2021-03-05 04:03:16,"I love this game so much! I love the levels and the soundtracks and that you can make your own level! But sometimes when I tap, it doesn’t jump. Like my character doesn’t jump. I don’t know if this is because of my device or the game. If you could try to fix it, that would he really helpful. Other that that, it’s an awesome game and I pretty much love everything about it! I love how the game is just, it’s just an awesome game and I can’t really describe how great of a game it is! Good work on the game! I love how you can make levels, customize your character,play levels,and so much more! This is probably my favorite game ever on the planet!!! ♥️",Love this game so much!!!
5,2020-12-30 21:56:09,"I love this game, I started playing when I was four. I left and just came back recently, last time I played (4 yrs ago) clutterfunk was a recent level. I just came back 3 months and I was wondering why I ever left! One thing bad is the lack of updates, another bad thing is the editor shuts down, also, when you click the windows button it kicks you out, one last thing is, why doesn’t right click work? It’s such a easily accessible button, you could also add new jump buttons, otherwise this is a very fun game! Thank you RobTop for making GD!!!",Amazing game! Could be improved
5,2019-08-15 03:23:39,"Geometry Dash is worth the purchase, and the screenshots don’t lie! It really does have an epic soundtrack, no ads, and no in game purchases! Plus all the features in online! You can make levels of your own, and publish it, or you can play other people’s levels, which are pretty sweet! You may get mad from time to time, but that’s what makes the game fun for me! (idk about anyone else) because the game gives a challenge! Anyways, I’ve been playing this game for 4 years, and through all the experience I’ve had with this game, I love all the memories, and I continue to make new ones! Overall, this game is soo worth the purchase! <3",It’s worth the purchase!
5,2019-06-07 00:59:49,"This game has an extremely fun way of making you feel like you master something. You can try a level for days or weeks and not beat it, but as you slowly get better and better at the level you get further and the whole game starts to get easier and fun. After a while, the Lite version just isn’t cutting it, WORRY NOT! Sub-zero, Meltdown and Worlds are here to save your entertainment! Still not enough? Just get the full version? Three ninety nine for a lifetime of entertainment!

5,2019-04-11 21:01:53,geometry Dash custom levels I can’t believe I found it because Dan TDM did a video without it and I press the button weird needed and I pressed search and it was awesome I loved it but it doesn’t have any free trials it doesn’t cost any money and it’s awesome I love this app but it gives me a headache and it messes with my brain like Dan TDM I wish I could start winning every single level and I’m not getting it and I barely did an every level and and I just move onto the next next level but those are harder runs so I just skip all of them but my favorite one is Qatar funky and I love it and my favorite custom level is Chuchel🍒,Geometry Dash custom levels chuchel l I love the designs omg🍒
3,2023-10-20 19:41:18,"I usually never comment but I have been playing this game since I was a kid and I absolutely love it and it beats any others game in my perspective and opinion but once I opened the app it immediately just takes me back to my Home Screen and I try again it’s closes the app so I delete it and download it again and it still happens so then I tried to erase the data (saved) and  try reinstalling and still nothing i think it was because of the IOS 17 update that caused it because before I updated it, it was running smoothly.  Rob top of you see this please help me out because I never wanna stop playing this and I have plans for releasing a level that may please you so please resolve this issue.",Not opening
5,2023-04-03 01:32:58,"Honestly, this game is amazing. My brother thinks I’m a sweat, (maybe) but it’s just that I’ve been playing for a few years. One thing that can be annoying is the hit boxes. On the level geometrical denominator, the rocket ship part, when you go down, the corner some how hits the rocket ship even if I go halfway down. Everything else is great. There is something a bit weird with the ufo though. Sometimes, in electrodynamix, the ufo will shoot up when I go through the portal. I love the creators, community, levels, and honestly everything. Consider yourself lucky, RobTop. I literally never write reviews. Have a great day!",Kool
2,2022-09-02 00:08:28,I’ve been playing this game for multiple years and actually made it onto the top 100 world leaderboard a few months ago. I had an amazing account and had finished all main levels and a lot of extra demons etc. I see a lot of reviews saying that there are glitches when you open the app and that it kicks you out immediately. That started a few months ago because Rob decided to make it so that ‘people with home button devices’ can’t play the game. It is now only intended for iPhone X and above including the recent new iPads. That’s literally the stupidest thing ever and sooooo dumb. So sorry to all of you with the same problem I had/have but if you have a home button device then I hate to tell you this but you are screwed. 😭🙄,Glitches
5,2020-06-05 19:24:27,So I will start with my ideas for 2.2 and the future 2.3.  So here we go with 2.2! First up we have vertical orbs! So the whole course changes vertical (up) and your not going in pause portal or something like that. Then a new level that has one of waterfalmes's music. Name it whatever the song is called. So that’s all for now. I will continue now with 2.3! Multiplayer mode! So you select a level (main or custom) custom is random btw. And then we have strong black orbs! (They are small and magenta lol) you go down VERY RAPIDLY like the black orb makes you land RAPIDLY but it’s 2X as strong. Thanks and I will get you more ideas soon robtop.,Ideas for future updates (2.2 and 2.3)
5,2020-01-25 04:46:31,"I paid for GeoDash whenever it was still freshman , installed it again and still love it. I’m grateful for this game existing because it made up a lot of childhoods, including mine, of course.   With that out of the way, the game is still wonderful on its own! There are many different levels that get continuously more difficult as you look through them. I remember each song just as well as I did as a kid. The visuals are flashy and bright, which to me looks really nice(epilepsy warning, by the way). I’m glad there’s an option to play levels that others have made as well. I always like watching the auto levels. They’re mesmerizing!   Anyhow...this review was mostly a blast to the past. This game holds a very special place in my heart and I thought I’d leave a review that the game deserves. Thank you to the creators for this awesome, now nostalgic game!  I’m not bothered by the fact that updates haven’t come out recently, either. That’s okay! It’s time to move on to new things! Bigger things!",Good even without the nostalgia factor!
5,2019-05-04 00:01:41,"Overall the game is amazing and unique but that’s not what I’m here to say. Every time I browse the levels to see which one I wanna do, there is a page at the end that says “More coming soon!”I’ve had this game for years and yet this has been the same. Geometry dash, you can’t just say something and not do it, you have to do it. This was very disappointing and it happened on your other games too.  Let’s talk about the good stuff though. Music, Tremendously amazing and retro. Difficulty, Impossibly difficult. Ratings, Straight up amazing!  I don’t feel like typing anymore so imma stop now. Thanks for reading!",Good overall but didn’t keep a promise
5,2023-10-18 00:48:35,"This is a great game, love the creativity involved and seeing all that creators can do. But as I’ve seen several other comments about before, I’ve updated my iPhone to iOS 17, and the game has stopped working, crashing every time I open it. This is an issue for many other people as well, and nobody has found a solution. Can you please fix this? It is only an issue for the full version and I don’t want to waste my two dollars. Fortunately GD Lite and World are still working and they will have to suffice, but please address this issue!  Thank you and love the game!!",Great game but update error
5,2021-08-14 15:19:22,"I’ve been very bored recently so I decided to start playing geometry dash again, and when I did I was instantly hooked. You spend hours of work dying over and over again just to get to the end of the level, but when you do it’s the most satisfying feeling ever. The level creator is amazing too. You can create masterpieces with just the tools provided. Over all this game I feel can be one of the greatest games of all time if it had more updates. I get that it’s a lot of work and 2.2 is going to have a ton of new things but it’s what keeps the games community alive.",My favorite game
5,2021-05-09 11:24:42,I really like this game and I play it pretty much everyday but I’ve ran into some issues. The game tends to lag especially on Time Machine. My sister also has this game and it tends to lag a bit differently than mine. When she opens the daily chests they begin to open up and right before they actually open the game freezes and my sister doesn’t get anything. A few little ideas for you too: I would really like it if we could search levels in other games like Meltdown and World. You could also add a bonus level (just for a thought) anyways thanks for reading! Bye!!,I love it but..
5,2019-08-07 14:29:13,"This game is so good that I literally can't describe it. I played ""The Impossible Game"" (the game's pre-cursor) and thought it was okay. I got Geometry Dash Lite and played all the levels (in practice mode) and admitted that I sucked at the game ever since it was about a month and I still couldn't beat Stereo Madness. Then I got the full version and that's where I started completely ADORING these games. I tried to beat Meltdown, World and Subzero but of course, I failed. It was still really fun though. My favorite part is the level editor. Something about making levels like one of the Super Mario Maker games or Wrecking Crew is just a pure joy. That's all I can think of so bubye!",Buy This App
3,2020-01-02 15:57:40,"I’ve played this game for around a year now, and the things that people have come up with is amazing. Unfortunately, the community is dying really quickly, and it’s been two years since the last massive update. There are a lot of good things about this game, and a lot of cons.   Pros:  -Lots of great levels out there created by the community can give hundreds of playtime hours.  -A really unique ‘creative’ mode to build a level of your dreams, and lots of different soundtracks to accommodate your build. -Awesome music.  Cons: -With a steadily decreasing community, it’s harder to get recognition as a builder or a great player due to less of a player base. -Whether you are playing on an iPhone or and iPad, you will have a very hard time beating levels created on pc due to device restrictions. -A developer who has been slowly drifting away from the community means that it’s harder to get featured due to most features being done manually.  -No signs of 2.2.  Whether or not you think that the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa, this game did indeed deliver quite a lot of playtime for me and only when things started slowing down did things get boring.",2.2....
4,2021-02-22 03:43:30,I was just playing and I was about to play a level before I opened a crate. I opened the crate and got nothing bc it never shows up since I logged in to my new account a few days earlier. I wanted to get out of this account so I don’t get this glitch and it says are you sure because what ever you did on this acc will get deleted so I was like ok that’s just gonna delete my new progress from the following week no I read it wrong and it deleted my acc and my inventory everything was gone I was so sad and I just gotta warn you. I had everything since 2015 and I almost finished the game but know I have to restart everything and I’m so mad,I am so mad
1,2023-11-09 03:51:04,"This game used to be great. I say used to be because it’s now so extremely and unbearably laggy. It’s to the point where the music is extremely noticeably ahead of where you are, and even with the music muted to reduce distraction of the delay, the lagginess is so bad to where the game you cannot beat levels because the lag continues your move and makes you die when you didn’t hold or tap the screen as long as it’s “reading”. This app needs an update to get rid of the delay and lag for it’s gameplay, and it needs it soon because it’s so unbearable and so distracting. And makes this game rather frustrating.  UPDATE: WHY IS THE APP NOW NOT OPENING?! Whenever I try to open the app, it crashes and doesn’t even attempt to start up. People thought this was an Apple issue but it’s not. UPDATE THIS APP SO THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IT PLEASE!",PLEASE UPDATE! THE LAGGING IS UNBEARABLE!
5,2023-11-07 16:22:49,"This is a REALLY good game, you have my approval👍, there is just one TINY thing that I would like changed. The coins 🪙, when you try to get the coins for any given level, you must first) get the coins to collide with your players hit box, and second) you must COMPLETELY FINISH the level. Just a small issue I have with the game, and it can be easily solved, all I ask is that you either a) make it so you can get the coins in practice mode, or b) make it so you don’t need to FINISH the level for the coin being collected to register. All else considered, this is really good(so be it rage inducing) game.",Really good… except
5,2023-05-30 16:26:51,"So I used to have the lite version and it was amazing, so one day I decided it’s time to get the full version. I love that it’s cheap but still one of my favorite games. All the levels are relatively hard to beat but I think that’s what makes this game unique. Most games have really easy, too easy first levels. But this one, no, it’s first level is an introduction and it’s not too hard to beat, but it will still take at least a day to beat, but the game is still so fun. Robtop did an amazing job with this game and I look forward to  getting their other versions of it too. Great job Robtop.",Amazing game

Just notice this review! But this is only on IOS 15 so if you are on that version I’m sorry your not getting to play",Very good but there is a problem
3,2022-09-25 01:33:11,"Overall the game is really good, but there are many bugs and glitches that ruin the game, others, not me cant get into the game, the main issue with me is that every-time i open a daily box it doesn't give me anything, trust me, I've checked, one thing that pushes people away is the difficulty of the game, there should be an easy mode where you cant die and be put back to where you were but has way lower rewards, another thing this game needs is more customation regarding color like you should be able to paint the mouth eyes and teeth a different color, other than the bugs and less customization than id want, id say this is the best way to spend 2$",Good game: needs improvement
5,2022-09-12 20:44:02,"Its a very good game I play it a-lot and its very addictive! Sometimes when I play the audio doesn't work and idk why. Although there is an easy fix by just closing out the game and going back in, I think the developers should fix it. Also when you do the follow twitter and subscribe you don’t actually have to subscribe just go back into the game and it will give you it, so developers you should work on that. But if your not sure to buy it or not try out the demo. Its called Geometry Dash Lite it has all the levels but less customizable options.",Good game! 2 bugs I’ve experienced.

Ive heard multiple complaints about this issue, but the only solutions I’ve found either haven’t worked for me or only worked on a computer. I have a IOS 15.2.1. So far I’ve tried deleting all downloaded songs, deleting the app and buying it again, and resetting all of my settings. Will this bug be fixed in the new update? If so, please release the new update soon. Thank you! It’s sad seeing such an amazing game like this not work.  Overall, still an amazing game and definitely worth 5 stars.",I can’t open the app.

But I can’t play it anymore. I can have it installed but when I tap on it it shows the loading screen for a split second and then closes itself immediately. I tried restarting my phone and I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling it. Nothing worked. The game doesn’t work anymore.

I have tried reseting my phone, I have tried reinstalling the app and I have tried updating my phone to see if that worked. It works on my other device which is my iPad just fine. I also can't play other Geometry dash games like Meltdown or lite. Do you have a solution to fix this problem?",Crashing constantly when entering first screen
4,2022-12-12 13:07:56,Geometry dash is an awesome game but going out and back in the game like mutes it so if you could fix that that would be great. multiplayer to basically just test your skills and have fun also for multiplayer there should be a vote of witch course to play. And if you could unlock the locked courses like cubestep and deadlocked that would be awesome. Also if you add any more main courses please make them easier also make the coins easier because stereo madness took me like 100 try’s to beat it. But in all geometry dash is pretty awesome but if you could do this it would cheer me up so if you do just know that I say thanks❤️,Hard but awesome would like multiplayer too
5,2020-09-05 21:28:56,"This is a amazing and challenging game, highly recommended. And every second counts towards your progression in each level. This is a amazing game, but one thing. Where is 2.2?, it’s been over 2 years now and still no updates. Even though RobTop has released 3 other GD games, I still would like to have new building items when you make a level. This is an awesome game but I would like to hear from RobTop about 2.2, I know it might take awhile, cause I never made a game lol. But at least update the GD community. Anyways, while a wait for 2.2, I’ll just keep making a playing some Geometry Dash. Keep Up The Good Work!!!","Ok, seriously, where’s 2.2?"

Despite the delay in 2.2, this game is an absolutely amazing game. The community has taken to making this game even better and making fun and interesting concepts  Transitioning to mobile, however, is kind of rough and is honestly a lot harder. I know that some pros have been able to beat extreme demons such as “Bloodbath”, but in my opinion PC is better, although it costs more  Account data transfer is also pretty bad, but overall legendary game","Amazing game, but not for mobile"
5,2019-05-27 22:58:52,"So in 2.11 it will not let people sign in on mobile (at least for me it won’t). So please fix that so I can sign in and play with fans. Also you cannot upload levels that you verified completely so it’s just a waste of time. So RobTop please fix both bugs so that people can enjoy the game. So keep the strings tight and don’t let the fall! (AKA keep up the good work). And can you make it so that any email may pass instead going through all this stuff that DOSENT EVEN WORK!

When I open the game it shows the RobTop logo, and crashes immediately after. I have no idea why this happens, because I tried the game when I first got it and it was absolutely fine. Afterwards I updated my phone to the new iOS update, and the problem I reported starts happening. Keep in mind I do have an iPhone 6s but I’m not sure if that’s the case or not. If you have an older iPhone model, consider what you just read before buying, but if you already have bought it, then good luck",Read this before buying if you have an older iPhone model
5,2023-01-02 16:02:49,"When I first downloaded Geometry Dash Lite, I immediately loved the game. This fun course through the levels are amazing, because they not only give you a challenge but introduce new mechanics as well! Once I got the full version, There were even more levels with even more mechanics! I was also introduced to the level editor, which allows you to make other levels. You can play other people’s levels too, which is great. If you like intense games with a lot of gameplay, Geometry Dash is the game for you! There is just one problem though… When will 2.2 come out?",Great game!
4,2022-07-05 16:26:24,"This game is awesome and I’ve had it since 2018 I even bought the steam version and now the iPad version is only for traveling. When I left yesterday, Geometry Dash/ Geometry Dash SubZero would not open, while World and Meltdown were fine. I uninstalled/reinstalled and it did nothing. They aren’t showing. Up on my settings either so i can’t check for an update. On google I saw that someone said that it only works on “non home button devices” and my iPad has a home button. I’m guessing this is apple’s fault since the new update came out and it messed with something. Besides this bug great game and lots of fun!",Awesome but recent bug (I can’t open)
4,2020-08-28 19:12:34,"So, the game is pretty good, we can all agree, but on mobile, it just won’t work, me and my friends are having the same problem, when we play deadlocked, the orbs are messed up, so we can’t beat it, plus, it’s been two years since 2.11 came out and no other updates? I know you are working on multiplayer, but 2 YEARS, also this game is meant for kids, I recently caught my child playing this exact same game and Playing a level called peaceful he showed it to me, and boy oh boy was it creepy, he now has a fear of the game and if he sees me playing it, he runs away in fear, he’s only 6 so that kind of make sense, but please just remove creepy or inappropriate levels,","Good, but not good enough"

But I would prefer playing on PC, overall this game is incredible, from easy levels to hard levels, just press to jump or fly or use the robot to jump etc. Simple, also make your own levels? Amazing, nothing better, your own music? The best! Also playing other people’s levels is awesome, making your own character, nothing is missing, just playing on PC would be better I believe.

I have had small problems with lag and music not working but I love this game and believe that one day, maybe soon, this game will be almost perfect aside from small almost insignificant things. I believe in the devs to make this game even better!",GREAT GAME
4,2019-08-13 12:12:35,"I’ve been playing since 2016, and since the beginning of May 2019, there was a bug: none of my levels will upload. It all started after I made my best level ever, and I mean THE BEST: Encryption. When I finished and verified it, I uploaded like I always do. But there was an exclamation point. I thought “Ok, maybe it’s because I didn’t do the ‘rate star’ thing.” So I tried it again. Didn’t work. And again. Didn’t work. And again and again. Didn’t work. My Wi-Fi is working just fine and I feel like it‘s not happening to anyone else! I hope RobTop can fix this bug in the upcoming update 2.2. And I’ll be happy again. But good game overall. Totally recommend it!",There’s a bug

There are a variety of different levels for every skill level, tons of unlockable skins and colors, and even an easy to use level builder! The only slight problem I have with this game is that over half of its existence has been waiting for an update, but it’s understandable considering the developer, RobTop, works on the game by himself. The community surrounding the game is also very welcoming. I would recommend this game to anyone willing to pay the 2$.",Best 2$ I’ve spent

Recently, there has been some sort of problem where iPhone users cannot open this app. I’m guessing it has something to do with a software update, but I’m bot sure. All I know is that all of the fun about this game is gone because I can’t ever open it! It’s really frustrating because it just goes to the loading page for about half a second and glitches out and closes the app. I would appreciate it very much if I could get my game back, and I’m wondering if anyone else is having this problem??

It says that the data successfully saved and loaded in the main game but still won’t pop up. It’s the same in geometry dash world and subzero. Can you tell me how to fix this please, or if it’s an issue on your end fix it? Like I said, I love this game so much and want to have everything. Thank you.",I want my data plz
4,2019-02-13 23:48:30,"Geometry dash may seem hard at first because, some players tend to do some hard level shortly after first getting this game. But then they get discouraged because “omg this seems haaard”, and don’t think they will be able to get to that level of skill. Just use practice mode more than you think, and you’ll do better. But anyway, this game actually has a level editor, used to make your own levels with infinite possibilities. And even publish them for other players to download them for themselves. THIS GAME DOESN'T ALLOW COPYRIGHTED MUSIC FOR COSTOM LEVELS. Tons of game modes to use and experiment with, and fun creators who put time and effort into cool, and visually stunning levels. Customizable icons, and characters become more available as you play the ‘campaign’ levels.   I’m extremely glad that there isn’t a shop where you can buy currency with your own money...

1,2023-05-03 12:50:44,I have been having problems with Uploading my level. You are supposed to complete your level you made (So that it is possible for other people to complete it) and then give a rate on how hard you think the level is (this is not the actual rating this is what you think it should be rated). I tried uploading it and it said this “❗️Upload failed. Please try again later” so I tried again later it still did not work I waited a couple of days and it still did not work. My level that I made was 37 seconds long and I worked hard. You should release a new update that can fix this bug. It’s very frustrating that I can’t upload my level. Also I paid $2.00 for this game and it’s not working properly so please fix it.,Uploading my level that I created failed

I have been playing since 2014 since I was in kindergarten and I’ve worked my way up to insane demons on mobile now!  The one thing that keeps me from giving GD 5 stars is that the updates take very long.  Ever since 1.9 updates took from 6 months to a year to almost 6 years now 🤯.  Even if there were just tiny updates like monthly bug fixes, glitch patching or better lag reducers, it would make the game a lot more interesting for the OG players!

All those reviews who say “tOo hArD!!1!” are wrong. After practicing a lot, you get the grip of it very fast, and you’ll be cranking out levels in no time! The amount of game modes is what makes GD REALLY fun though. Everyone is so creative with their levels (except levels from the Recent Tab…)! You really won’t be able to put this game down.

Let me say, it’s exactly like I remember it, challenging, fun, and riveting. I would like to say that I was a bit sad to see that the update hyped by subzero still hasn’t come out yet, but I can get past that. Also, it seems to me that when I exit the game, the audio won’t load the next time I open it, unless I swipe out of the game completely. Over all, I do really enjoy this games presence, and how entertaining it is. 10/10 would recommend to someone.",Fun!
5,2020-12-14 04:13:21,"geometry dash has been a consistent favorite game. although it costs money, i highly suggest it. it’s the type of game that anyone could enjoy enough to keep playing. the music, graphics, and overall quality is great. the one thing i’m wondering about is that even though it works and is awesome, it feels... abandoned. the last update they made was 3 years ago. they told us that there was another update coming, but they either got lazy and didn’t do it or it’s some hugeeeee update that takes years. but there are certain things in the app that make me feel like they abandoned it, like when i click this certain thing (i don’t remember what it is lol) it says that blah blah blah was ended whatever years ago which seems weird. so it feels a little suspicious and gets me wondering, but overall, this game is worth the purchase. the complexity in the levels and the motivation to keep playing gives it a 5-star review. stay safe and have a nice day! thanks!",yes

If it still comes to over 24months, just make the update shorter.(As like taking out some features). 8 understand that you have a life to and you would like to spend the most of it.

At first the game is extremely difficult, and you end up almost quitting, but then it starts to get easier. You complete the first level, and feel an amazing amount of satisfaction, and start on the next one. Eventually, once you get good enough this game is just satisfying in general. You can also make your own levels and play others levels, but I’m not that good at making them. Overall it is just an amazing game at an amazing price. Keep up the good work RobTop!",My favorite mobile game
3,2018-07-26 14:45:26,While the levels are great there are glitches with the editor system. I’ve been recently having a glitch where I can build and edit but cannot delete anything. Also when you have overlapping blocks and test the level in the editor sometimes the block underneath will show instead of the one on top and if you have a decoration as a group following player x the decorations sometime disappear. This isn’t as big of an issue because it works when you play the level normally. Another glitch is that when you play any level sometimes the music or the level buffers and causes the music to be not synchronized with the level. Please fix these in the new update.,Too many glitches

Second reason, you can make your own levels and share it to people. And obviously this game has no ads, unlike the free version. The level editor is real nice. I did enjoy making my own levels.

There only a few concerns. I think that Mods and Elder Mods should be able to ban Hackers, level stealers, and account hackers. I feel this is important because Breeze is a terrible person and has hacked the game, dislike botted GD YouTubers of people who exposed Breeze. This would be helpful because it would influence people who’s accounts were hacked and quit into coming back, knowing this is a much safer community. Thank you RobTop!

It may be big or I am just stupid, either or it is still a mistake. But this complaint is not at all to be taken away from the attractiveness of the game itself.

It can be difficult to get good at, but if you persevere, you can experience the really cool stuff that’s in here.

2,2019-10-15 22:24:37,"Let me start by saying that I’ve been playing Geometry Dash since 2014, and I used to enjoy the game very much. However, the developer of the game has become extremely lazy over the past few years. Updates come roughly every 2 years or so, with the latest update having been nearly 3 years ago. Whereas updates prior to the 2.0 update would consistently add new content and new levels to the game within a couple months of each other. The developer of the game fully acknowledges that his game is dying due to his lack of contribution and constantly falls back on his promises. Knowing this, the community even offered the idea of a dev team for the game, with some people even offering to work for free. RobTop has turned all of these ideas down.","Glitch fest, hackers, lazy developer"

For me it dosent even add in the stuff I click?!. So It seemed really fun 🤩 but it’s not. (Only the create your own game, the other part of the app I would 100% recommend.) I’m kind of disappointed that I spend $2.00 on that. It’s basically the same thing, just with make ur own game, no ads, new levels.

I get that you can’t speed that up and there’s a lot of content coming but that doesn’t change it.

The level editor is awesome and will be even better when 2.2 comes out. I eventually beat all the levels including the demons, and started playing online levels. Holly crap the online levels themselves are worth the price fully. The creativity and work that goes into levels is awesome. I got 40% of a level called sakupen circles. That level is so detailed.

I was confused why it was failing thinking it was my wifi but then i went to my friends house and it still didn't work. Tried it at school and it didn't work. Then I tried to upload a level o worked really hard on but I couldn't. That was 2 weeks ago. I’ve been waiting for it to fix but it’s not working. I can’t save my progress and then uninstall because it keeps failing. I also can’t view any of my friends accounts. If the devs see this please fix this in 2.2,Fun game but…
4,2021-11-02 20:48:11,"Ok, so- WE INTERRUPT THIS REVIEW TO GIVE YOU BREAKING NEWS   GEOMETRY DASH HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS   1. Hackers: there is this player above me in the rankings called CarrotMaster and I saw comments on his levels saying: CarrotMaster is above me in the rankings. That must mean CarrotMaster is a hacker.  2. Fails: I keep attempting and attempting but I just can’t post levels. It just says when it finishes loading: Upload failed, please try again later. It irritates me so much.  3. Rage: I would not recommend to people like Markiplier, because I call Markiplier: the king of rage. And other people like him will rage when something involving progress will rage.   4:2.2: people are commenting on your game that 2.2 was supposed to come LAST YEAR, but that didn’t happen. Now people are angry about it, it is the biggest update of gd. And by big, I mean BIG.  5: add a “recalibrate music” button, urgent requests have lead from lagging levels (like “the lost existence” at the first ball).  We all need you to fix these problems or people will go nuts. But overall, the game is amazing.",BREAKING NEWS
5,2022-12-02 23:50:18,"This game was very good and still is I have no complaints about it the new iPad iOS update fixed the app not opening Which made me very happy seeing I could play this game again I used to play this as a kid also in the free version, Also May I give you a thank you for making a free version I don’t know if it was because i was just young but even in the free version you could see yourself playing for hours because of how fun the game is. Overall very great game keep up the good work we appreciate what you were able to give to the community.",Masterpiece
5,2022-07-20 21:23:20,"I rate this game very highly because it is one that incorporates the elements of being highly entertaining/stimulating with its endless variety in levels created by others (only in full version), the creativity, and the interplay of color, movement, and music to create an endlessly captivating experience. However, an issue prevents me from opening the app at all with the new update on IOS that may interfere with the game’s functionality which I hope will be fixed soon because I would like to play the game again 🥲",Overall good but waiting for 2.2 update
4,2019-10-24 21:05:56,"I started liking this game since xStep came in. What I don’t like is that sometimes, the jump doesn’t work, and I don’t know why but it’s very annoying, and Dry Out is more harder from the easy levels and it’s too hard for starters. The thing everybody hates is that when your doing Practice Mode, it sometimes gives a checkpoint to the parts you die, so then they take the checkpoint off, it gets harder to pass that part but you pass it anyway. And the last thing I hate most is when your in a part of a level, and you go upside down, you sometimes glitch and your still upside down. But I still like the levels, and the difficulty.",Good But Bad ...
5,2021-10-07 04:05:34,The icons and levels your levels are awesome DEADLOCKED that I was betting to beat I keep getting close attempts pretty sure I should beat your demon deadlocked the coolest icons are cool the design is cool and the colors are better for the icon if we didn’t have that the icon could have been gray oh well in the options the smooth fix in editor mode is working and my levels are working Robert tapala thx for making geomtry dash the icons are good the levels are good I was trying to be a helper by rating and rating and rating I did my best to be a helper Rob-top this was the message bye a fan of this game…!,Icons and more
5,2019-11-22 19:38:42,"This game is awesome, once you start you just want to continue, with the high variety of levels there is sure to be one you like, the 21 official levels range from fairly easy to crazy hard! Even if you beat them all you can test yourself with the online levels, whe harder levels still lurk, the extreme demons, these will make sure you won’t stop playing, levels like Sonic Wave, Bloodbath and Idols will make you keep on playing! I have recently finshed Fingerdash and am itching for more! My only issue is the much hyped 2.2 update, Roobtop? When will it come out?",Impossible to stop! Except one thing. . .
4,2018-05-30 16:01:36,"The game is amazing! I love playing it and even though it annoys the crap out of me sometimes I still enjoy beating levels and making my way through harder and harder difficulty. The few drawbacks are-  I have been saving up orbs(currency) and recently I had a friend over and I was showing him my progress in the game and he tapped an icon(character) to show me what he would get if he had it, while trying to close it he hit the buy button and in the confusion I lost 2,000 orbs! I really wish there was a way to retrieve lost orbs to recover from accidents like this. Other than that I have no other problems worth mentioning. Thank you.",Great game! Some faults...
5,2019-04-28 15:58:50,"This game is not worth 1.99 it is worth way more! This game is packed with everything you could possibly think of. This game has gauntlets, map packs, original levels, level creator, search (to search for player created levels) there is daily and weekly levels and leaderboards and more. If you get a certain amount of secret coins you can unlock more levels. There is so much more to this level that it would take days to say if you have 2 dollars and love the lite version  you should get this game. (If you get this game please play my level called “road trip full”) Thanks 🙂",Amazing game
4,2022-07-31 15:57:54,"I was in a middle of a game, super close to beating my hardest level, than the game crashed, I tried swiping up and playing again, but it crashed again. I tried powering my iPad off, didn’t work, I tried checking the apple store to see if there is any update or problems, nothing. I even tried searching up how to stop crashing, after 532 videos of failure, I gave up. It kinda waist of money, so I hope after weighting this review, so the creators will give me an answer for how to fix this 3 years of crashing, and make the money worth it.

5,2023-11-11 16:31:09,"So I’ve played this game for a long time now and had no problems with it. It was really fun until one day when I tried to open it, it crashed immediately and took me to my Home Screen. I tried again thinking it was some bug that happened in my phone and it still didn’t work. I’ve tried everything.

I still rated the game 5 stars because it is a good game, although I can’t play it at the moment. TO EVERYONE ON IOS 17 WHO CANT OPEN THE GAME: I have good news for you. On October 2023(i believe it is Oct 22), Robtop games(the gd dev) will release Geometry Dash 2.2. This will add a load of features to the game, and, most importantly, add support for IOS 17.

4,2022-10-12 22:14:04,"Personally i think this is a great game and have played it for a long time starting on my moms old iphone 3gs. recently I upgraded from an iPhone xr to a Iphone 14 pro max, and the game feels like it’s running at a lower refresh rate than it did on my old phone, which is weird since the new phone has double the refresh rate. I dont know if the game just hasnt been optimized since apple relased the new adaptive refresh rate for iphones, and its opting for something lower (maybe 50hz), or something entire else with the game going on. other than that its a great game and I highly recommend it.","Great game, feels like it’s stuttering on new phone"

5,2021-05-19 21:10:55,"I head of this game about two to three years before I bought it. It is a good game to develop and practice hand-eye coordination. I like how the levels are put together and the innovative forms the character can take. The only problem is that quite a few levels are rated either too high or low. For example, in my humble opinion Blast Processing should be rated a hard level (it is rated harder) and Can’t Let Go should be rated harder.  But overall, no big mistakes. This is a very good game, especially as far as mobile games go","Great game, even somewhat addictive"
5,2020-09-15 00:39:19,"I really like this game, but my game is glitched. No matter what it doesn’t allow me make an account. Whether it’s a google or Microsoft account, it denies it no matter what. It also doesn’t allow me to create levels. When I create levels and try to upload them, even though they are verified, it always denies. 100% of the time, it never allows me too. My internets fine, but it doesn’t  care. Only solution I can think of is deleting it and re-installing it, but then I lose everything, my level progresses, and created levels. That’s my only problem, but either way, I love this game.",It’s bugged for me.
5,2019-03-23 21:38:53,"This game is amazing. It’s so good and fun. It’s amazing the play, the levels are awesome, I love the level editor, the soundtrack is awesome, but there’s one thing that I hate. That thing is, that I can’t login. Basically, I pressed register I typed in my email and I type in all the information I need. But then it said that my email is invalid when I literally use it all the time. Every other game that I play that I have to login to always allows my email. I don’t know why this game does this, but I think you should fix it please. Other than that this game is completely amazing. 🤗",This game is awesome! But there is one mistake…
5,2023-11-10 17:52:37,"Yes, you read the title, This is a extraordinary game, but, guess what? Update 17.1 on Apple made the game unplayable, You need a 64 bit game to have the app working. If your already working on this, I understand all the overwhelming, with all the community getting mad for your delays, I understand. They may hate it, but RobTop, You are only trying to fix things. This is the biggest update ever in the game history. Take your time, Me and all the understanding part of the community is rooting for you, even the biggest of YouTubers, like GD Colon, Take your time, we will be by your side.","Great game, but one thing.."

So I can’t wait for this to be available for iPhones so I can join in on the fun. For people like play Geometry Dash World where if you complete it you can play some community games.

Yes, it’s Frustrating but fun at the same time, it’s like you press on the obstacle you want and then you get in and then and have to press your way through it, I have completed the following levels:Stereo madness, Xstep, Clutterfunk, Back on track, Don’t let go, and more. I have only completed 8 demons, I recommend this game if you like challenges this game is worth buying, This game is the best game you can buy.",So good I love it
4,2018-11-06 22:32:32,"This game is great and extremely fun and addicting. The levels are great and lots of creators make great levels that are perfect for the this game. Unfortunately I have a few concerns. Some of the online levels have extremely graphic content. And some of the creators swear and write very inappropriate things. I remember, when I was ten, watching these extremely inappropriate levels and being very scared about a game that is for kids four and older. The levels I am most referring to are “Wysteria” by Triaxis, “Wisteria V2” by Jjjo , and “Undertakers Daughter” by Jayuff. Please, Robtop change this and the constant swearing. Then Geometry Dash will be a better and more positive game that everyone can enjoy.",An unforgettable game

But there is a glitch that happens a lot to me whenever i leave my phone and it automatically turns off all the audio from in the game and i have to restart the game. I don't know if its just my headphones or what but if your able to fix it you can. You don't have to because your probably busy with 2.2.

I thought that maybe this was just a normal bug that would be fixed but its already been 2 years and I had created a lot of levels.  So what I think what happened is when the day the game costed money I couldn’t log on, so maybe this is a bug that needs to be fixed for people on mobile who joined the game before it costed money but devs if you are reading this, if there is some way you can fix this bug I would really appreciate it.

I’ve Ben playing this game for 3 years now and those 3 years have been the best of my life, the game is so fun and challenging and never gets old. My favorite part of the game is the level editor, I love to create levels and have 2 of them rated :D but there are a couple bugs.... sometimes in the editor when I use the no lip mode then the screen locks up and while upswing mock-up mode sometimes your icon will get stuck in place and there are some others but otherwise a great game.",Such a fun and difficult game

I really want you to finish 2.2 so we don’t have to struggle with the bugs, but this is such a good game you’ve made for us and the community grows stronger everyday.

I have also encountered this glitch on the subzero and world versions of the game, and I don’t want to delete all my progress on the main levels and whatnot just to have it be for nothing. I also worked really hard on a kind-of layout style level on and off for a few years that I’m really proud of and I don’t want to remake it, because it will not be the same.

I bought geometry dash full version, but the game always kicks me out which is a complete waste of $2.18. I try to delete it and reinstall it, but it keeps kicking me out of the game.

4,2020-11-21 14:53:15,"Ever since my father mistaken this app for a learning app, I have been playing it ever since. Yes, it’s frustrating but when you complete it at the end, (especially a demon) you feel a rush of relief and triumph. But in the progress, that’s not so easy. But, I love the app. I’ve been playing it for 7 years now! The only thing that needs work, is the update time. It takes like 6 years to get another level and new decoration. Yes, I know there is going to be more game modes, but come on RobTop! You can work on it constantly and have 2.2 done in like, 7 months. Overall, it’s a really good application. I strongly recommend you and your friends to download this app.",Amazing

In general though, the music, the objects and such and the icons and the entire game in general is really good. Sometimes there were some flaws in the game such as bugs and such. But other than that its a big game thats a part of a lot of people’s childhood, and glad to say that I was part of the hype too. And now that the mew update is nearly here its gonna be fun and maybe even push the game to further heights.",Amazing
4,2020-10-31 01:59:21,"The game is great and all, but one thing, only the rob top created levels like a story mode in a call of duty game, so stereo madness and can't let go, the music is working for them, but when I go to user created levels, the music does no work for them at ALL, I have downloaded the songs for each level and the songs Do not work, I don't know if this is a bug or if there is an exploiter in the game. Please tell me if I need to turn on something to make it work ASAP. And also note that the SFX sounds are working like the death sounds. I really want to play y'all's game but I don't wanna play it without the awesome user created music!!",Well I think you need to fix a bug
4,2023-09-30 02:11:48,"This game automatically crashes on IOS 17. This is because geometry dash is a 32-bit game, and iOS 17 no longer supports 32-bit games. Soon, Macs will be getting an update, which most likely means Macs will no longer support 32-bit games. One way to fix this is to make the game 64-bit. This might be hard, but it will be very useful for mobile players, and soon, even Mac users. Currently the only way to open geometry dash is to not update to iOS 17, but most people would like to update. I am an avid geometry dash player and so not being able to play geometry dash on mobile is very devastating.",Support for Mac and iOS 17
5,2020-06-03 19:48:14,So I think you should add more insane levels and one called Bloodwise and new item like reverse orbs and one to add to a level that make you reverse like portal reverse orb 1 will be for a unique kind of shop called dark shop and reverse orb 2 would be similar to the upside down but it reversed the screen like the portal and please if you do consider Bloodwise make a boss in it well I haven’t unlocked demons so idk if they have bosses but in Bloodwise make it so you have to defeat the boss to complete the level. Please consider some or all I think it will make the game really cool in my opinion and maybe others too!,More levels Ali NV with new items
5,2018-01-18 23:42:13,"This is one of best games to play on your mobile device! The graphics are crisp, and the soundtrack, along with the custom songs from Newgrounds, is amazing. It’s also how I was introduced into the awesome musical world of Dubstep and Electro music. The gameplay is also very simple, it requires a simple tap on the screen and a bit of muscle memory.  Last but not least, the replay ability is through the roof! There are plenty of levels that will keep you occupied for a very long time, depending on how good and dedicated you are to the game.  Overall, this is mine, and hopefully your, favorite mobile game!",*my opinion*
4,2022-12-08 03:25:16,I love this game because the lite version had only about 8-10 levels but this one has them all! i even love how the let you make your levels. the one thing i don't really like is that most level's like stereo madness says its easy but its not really for most people ill give it a 4 star do to things say its easy but its really hard and also the levels are really long and boring i feel like there should be more levels with the wave and ufo and robot so i hope if anybody reads this its a good game with some flaws but overall i recommend it if you like challenge games and/or you like geometry dash,Awesome game.
4,2022-09-05 00:28:51,It is really a great game and I love it but there  is a problem with it. It would let me play then all the sudden it wouldn’t let me open on the app.I would tap the app and it would go to the Rob top screen then just kick me out.I looked it up and it looks like it happens to other people to and their solutions did not work. But it is a really REALLY awesome game and I really want to play it again because it is the only version that lets you build levels but it just doesn’t let me into the app. I am not sure this happens to everyone though. I Am just saying this so Maby Rob Top could fix it if they read this.,IT IS AN AWSOME GAME but….

5,2021-03-07 21:20:31,"I love this game. it is easy to learn, but hard to master. the base levels are very good, but the best part of the game is that players can create their own levels. this makes it so that the game has thousands of levels, so you never get bored. it is well worth the $2. the only problem is the level creator is so freaking complicated. just changing the color of one block is hard to figure out. i know the game hasn’t been updated in like 4 years, but if they start again i would definitely suggest making the level creator easier. other than that, this game is amazing!",Amazing

There’s something about this game that is just so great that keeps bringing me back. It is such a simple game to understand and play, yet it still gives so much freedom for what you can do in the game. There are a few bugs here and there but you can’t expect a game to be perfect.

The game is currently hella dead, do some thing to impress me and get us out of purgatory. I want to play it, but nothing ever changes and there is nothing to do. Unless there are new features, the online community tab can only keep us busy for so long. We all feel this way about the game and are to scared to say anything, but OH MY GOD THIS IS GETTING SO BORING. I hope this once nice community can be saved from the toxic pit of hell we currently have. On the rare chance this actually gets seen, By Robtop or Viprin, please, PLEASE do SOMETHING to keep us busy.",2.2 is probably never going to come out
5,2018-05-01 19:22:05,"Yes, this game took five years and the current update is 2.1 Robtop put a lot of effort into this and made an amazing game. This game has infinite possibilities and is fun if you are good at the game, there are even stuff like creator points accounts vaults chests there is just too much to explain! But there are a few downsides though, the newbies don’t know what this is and will fail on stereo madness immediately, and also the level editor is super hard to figure out (especially with the triggers) So you have to learn online.

I absolutely love it! I can’t put my phone down because of this game! But.... I have one suggestion. Could you please add the original music to the practice mode? I don’t know why I’m asking this, but I thought it would be cool. I just thought it would be fun to hear the original song of the level except for the practice song on each level while all of them have a different song for the original mode. Thank you!",Perfect!!!

If the smooth fix isn't activated, there are probably going to be little visual glitches, but really no problems with consistency, now when you activate it, it has a high chance to cause inconsistency in the visual and audio of the levels while it fixes the little visual bugs.

Having an account isn't an essential thing in the game so that part is not a big problem. Everything else is great though. If you are thinking about getting this game, I think it is a good idea. Thank you RobTop!",Why $2?!
5,2023-08-07 11:57:13,"I have played geometry dash since 2021 and it’s always been very fun to make and beat levels. The only problem I have is how long the updates take to come out. But besides that, I recommend this game.  For the people having issues with the game crashing when you try to open it, you may need to get a new device, as the game no longer seems to support older processors. Maybe this’ll be fixed in 2.2?  I used to have that problem as well, but since I got a new device, the game has been running fine.",Very good game
4,2022-10-23 16:49:20,"This game is awesome and you can also play it basically anywhere.😀 but theres a bug that annoys other people.. So basically what happens is that when they try to open the game, it crashes and goes to the home screen. I hope you make a small update to fix this or fix it in 2.2 please. I understand you are working on it but it would be a pleasure for a decent amount of people to have this fixed. Same for the other gd games. Other than that, high quality👍👍👍. i would recommend trying this game out. Thats basically it",Great game! But a little thing that annoys people..
5,2022-08-23 10:16:44,"I love Geometry Dash so much, ever since I saw EricVanWilderman play it, and it just seemed so interesting and fun, and it’s definitely one of my top games. But something that makes me mad is that for some reason, after I downloaded the full version on my phone, I tried to get into the game, but it just logged me out. I tried several more times but it never worked. I’m not sure if it’s just Apple phones or if it’s a glitch, but if it’s some type of glitch or bug, I’d love for you guys to get that fixed. Other than that I love this game!",Annoying Glitch

I am an Original player since 1.0 and this game is doing amazing the community not so much I like the sneak peak and stuff I know you have been working hard on this game and I am proud that it’s coming soon and my biggest level thanks to you for making editor, But my biggest level is something called topi challenge look it up for hard rating and I have around 105 or 106 like All because of you Rob top, And if you see this I want to try becoming an mod chances are you won’t see his but I just want to inform you, DO YOUR BEST AND DON’T RUSH! 😃",Geometry dash

So I was like I want some new levels and all that so I downloaded the new version. I was so excited to play!!! I just don’t have words, I’m so mad. It says that my phone can play this game but whenever I open it I exits off the game. I DONT EVEN CARE IF ITS JUST TWO DOLLARS I WANT MY MONEY BACK OR AT LEAST FOR THE GAME TO WORK!!!!!! This makes me so mad I was sooooo excited to play this and I thought you guys would create a game that would work… maybe???

4,2020-11-16 13:19:32,"By the way I spelled the first word you can probably tell that I am a kid this game is good for people who are looking for intertainment. But... be where if you get angry or upset easy this game might not be right for you. If you are wondering why, it’s because it is extremely difficult and I have known people who have broken their iPads or iPhones over this game. If you are looking at the reviews to see if it is violent or whatever it indeed is not. When you get hit by a spike there isn’t any blood or anything like that you just dissapear and restart. Ounce again if you have anger problems or anxiety maybe you should not play the game. THANK YOU GEOMETRY DASH!",Intertaining and fun
5,2022-03-02 01:10:05,"I love this game and the way you challenge yourself to beat fun levels. Recently i stopped because I started getting board but that doesn’t mean I didn’t like it. Now, I am trying to play GD but it just kicks me out every time I click the app. I have deleted it and added it back multiple times but it still doesn’t work. It is either the app isn’t working for me or it is the device storage IDK. I as long tried to get into GDW GDM and GDS and those wont work. Even tho this is happening to me, I rate this game a DRUM ROLL PLEASE……………….5/5. FULL MARKS> IT IS AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.",Fun but now I can’t play
5,2021-07-31 03:23:00,This game is very frustrating but...its good the animation the skins the humor the levels everything else I love the fact that the levels get progressively harder each time it gives you time to practice before each level and also the fact that you can make you're own levels and share them to other people you can also play other people's levels online anyway if anyone is reading this before playing I recommend playing it it's really fun...can be really fun but yea that's it thanks for listening bye.,GD is a GG
4,2023-10-08 14:51:20,"With iPadOS 17 being released, I encountered an issue. The game did not work. I only can only assume it’s something apple did because the app has not updated in around 6 years. I think if an app on the apple App Store has not been updated in a long time span, the system will assume it is not up to date with needed security features. I hope this gets fixed with GD 2.2, with the release of 2.2 being just around the corner as I am writing this. I enjoy the game and wish it a happy 10th birthday. Thank you for reading through all this Stereo madness😝",I only gave this a 4 star because of it not working
5,2019-06-12 22:27:10,Robtop... cmon. On mobile now? Thank god. I dont have a running computer and all i can do is yt. Very good game. I play this every day. Its amazing. Seriously. Not for people who say the first level is hard. I swear. Its not. I beat the last level and then seemed like everything was over. I havent beat a single demon and i still am into this. Ive got... hmm... 99% on mastergame. And 98% on cant let troll. Im not dibrised. Ive only seen one glitch and its in fingerdash. At about 19% u can go through a block and die. This game will never end and more user levels appaer everyday. So once u jump in to the rabbit hole. U can never pull ur self out.,Bravo...
3,2019-04-26 16:54:24,The game itself is not bad but I have some suggestions and complaints. First the complaints. Some of them are literally IMPOSSIBLE. I know they are supposed to be challenging but seriously some are challenging and some are unbeatable. There’s a difference. And also if you play on a kindle (I experienced this myself mind you) it won’t save your progress if you turn it off. Not shut it down. Simply hit the off button not hold! It’s ok but really fix this unless you want to start losing business. Suggestions... make more options in the creator. I know there are tons & tons of options but honestly after trying to make millions of levels it’s awful. We need more options. That’s all bye!,Not bad
5,2018-08-01 18:24:36,"This game is the best ever.... it has endless possibilities, and you never get bored of the MILLIONS of levels. It has tons of secrets too... 😏 this game is also not educational so don't get this just because it has the word ""geometry"" in it. You can create your own levels and post them online for others to play. I would play this game forever. It may cost money bit it's still so worth it. The game also has soundtracks to listen to and achievements, icons, characters, and more. The game is actually pretty beautiful. It has auto levels with pure artwork and skill. This game overall is the best game ever.",THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,2018-02-08 02:52:20,I have been playing this game scince September 2017 This is officaly my first favorite game I love the update of 2.1 it has many different icons which I like also the soundtrack are GREAT!However It really has a big purpose of beating Deadlocked and getting coins to get ultimates it is so great that I play this nonstop I really love all of the icons it is very hard to get but I never give up ever since 2.1 came out this game has been really good and the Robtop levels are awesome and has very good things to get also I have been enjoying this game very good my friends don’t like it to much but it should be rated oftenly.,MORE UPDATES IS AWESOME!!!!!!!
5,2023-11-01 21:02:23,Geometry dash has always been my favorite video game I’ve been playing it for as long as I can remember but recently I have upgraded to iOS  17 and it has stopped working and crashes whenever I open the app. This is extremely frustrating because I love this game so much. I did my research and found that the only way for iOS 17 users to play the game is if you won’t update to the 64 bit version. I under stand if you don’t see this but I hope you do because I would love so much if this game was playable agian.,Another Error
4,2023-08-09 05:39:41,"I love this game , why did I give it a 4 star , because like 4 or 2 years ago they did updates , the first year they did the update , it was glitchy , the 2ed time it was laggy to the point I couldn’t play , I had to wait a year for it stop , the 3rd time it got worse I tapped on the game and it gave me a half second look and went BYYYEEEE , like it just saw some gay hater , I’m not …. Anyway I waited 2 years and I got it , it’s all good now but if this happens wait a couple months or year to get on again or your doomed and you waisted time , and it’s amazing so 5/5 it’s just 4/5 bc of what happened years ago",Read dis
5,2023-09-27 00:54:07,The game is great and super fun to play. I have had this game since I was 7 and I love it. Me and my friends really enjoy the game. But when I had an update for apple the game just keep logging me out every time I tried to rejoin. I have not made account. I was planning on making an account today but I could not load the app. I really hope I can get back on the game. I hope others will play too. Also when is update 2.2 coming out? I hope that their is something wrong with the phone and not the app. 👾,"Amazing, but on problem"
4,2020-06-21 01:57:00,Hello. I love this game a lot and I’ve started to play it on my phone a lot more. There’s just one suggestion I have. Sometimes I need to pause the game to do something or accidentally turn off my phone while playing the level which pauses it. When I unpause  it sometimes I am not able to jump in time for the obstacle right I front of myself and die. It’s a little annoying. I was just wandering if you could add a count down when you pause then unpause so you get back in focused on what’s about to happen. Thank You and I love Geometrydash. Keep up the hard work :D,Love this game just one Suggestion.
5,2023-07-21 23:42:49,"Don’t listen to the one stars. Those are just people begging for new updates. The game itself is an amazing game and even the demo is good. The real one just has player created levels and more skins and more things to do. I get player created levels doesn’t seem like much but it’s real. You can also create levels, you just need an account to publish them to the world. Making an account is really easy. It only requires an email to prove you are not a bot. If you are thinking about getting this game, it is so worth the $1.99. 🤩",🤩
5,2023-02-18 23:19:15,"Since there are levels in GD that are almost auto but have very little inputs, it would probably be a good idea to add a ""Beginner"" mode or something along those lines, and make those give you 1 star, and autos give none. Additionally, since levels are going to get harder and harder with the 2.2 mechanics, you could probably add an ""Impossible Demon"" above extreme demon, since keeping every hard level collectively at extreme is very vague. Overall though, this is a very good game, and I am looking forward to playing new updates!",Ideas for 2.2/2.3
5,2022-05-09 02:27:04,"I saw my kid playing this game and ragging! He threw himself across the room in a blind fury, and when I asked him what he was playing he showed me! This game has intense gruesome violence, I nearly had a heart attack when the square touched the triangle! Furthermore, this game is satanist! Have you ever wondered why the hardest levels are called ‘demons’ not ‘god modes’? That’s right! The sheer abound of satanic content is redonkulous. I bought this for my kid a few years ago to help him study but his grades got worse! I want a refund, not educational! In conclusion, never let your child play this game.",This game is NOT for kids!
3,2022-04-20 02:13:14,"I bought this game awhile ago, after about two-three weeks it just shut down.. every time i would try to open the game it would just shut down, i’ve updated and restarted my phone, deleted the game and reinstalled it multiple times but it just wouldn’t work and it would just keep shutting down. I still have the game and i’m trying to make it work but it won’t. I have an Iphone iOS 15.4.1, if you know why it’s shutting down can you or someone tell me why it’s not working? if it won’t work is there a way I can get money back. (my mom bought it for me so if there is a way i could get money back it’s all on her.) THE GAMES GOOD THOUGH 🤠👍.",.
3,2022-01-02 19:16:26,"The overall game is amazing. Great for long car trips, or just sitting back and relaxing. I love that it’s so easy to make your own level, and you can make your own training courses to get better at the game. I don’t like that RobTop is mostly ignoring mobile level makers, but I can live with it. What I can’t stand is that as of downloading iOS 15.0, the game fails to start. It displays the loading screen, then immediately closes the app. I’m not sure if this is a problem on my end, or on RobTop’s (the same thing has happened to me with every other GD but Meltdown), but I really enjoyed playing, and I wish I could play more.","Good, but unplayable (at least for me)"
5,2021-08-02 17:22:49,"With a new update coming soon, and a lot looking forward to… it’ll be great! This game is so fun and addicting, I love it and I can’t stop playing it! It’s not as easy as this game looks though, You know those types of games that are in the category: rage game? It’s basically one of those games. But all you need is practice.      The editor is really good as well. Again, to make good levels you need practice, but it’s still amazing.      If I were looking for a game that would be hard and addicting, this would be the game!       5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",The. Best.
5,2019-10-12 19:35:35,"This game pushes the limits of human creativity. Anyone could make a great level if they put enough effort into it. It is like Minecraft, in the way of creativity and amount of things there are to do. You can create levels or beat levels, all of varying difficulty and creativity. You can make retro games, mini games of a sort, or just platforming levels. There are so many options that can do so many different things. My only issue is how long updates take to come out. I understand that it’s a one man team though, and I applaud RobTop for doing such a great job on this game.",Amazing game!
5,2019-06-15 05:36:28,"I’ve been playing this game for years and I still enjoy it today, but there was a problem recently when I tried to sync my account. I was able to load the account, but when I tried to sync the data for it there was a problem. No given reason, just that there was an “error.” If you could please fix this, or at least give a possible reason for it that would be great. It’s a little disappointing that I had to lose all my progress from the past year. Other than that very good game and very addictive.",Great game but needs a fix
4,2021-08-10 02:30:16,"Geometry dash is a fun game to play when you have time on you hands, but it takes a lot of rage quitting, and just getting disappointed. It takes a lot of practice so don’t expect to be good as the youtubers in 2 days. You’ll probably be stuck on the first level for over a week but the second level makes up for it, the game is amazing because after a lot of practice you become better which motivates you to play more. So overall I’d rate it 5 stars, but because it having soooooooooooooo many bugs, I rated it only 4. BYE! Hopefully this was useful for you!","Wonderful, but not."
5,2019-02-01 16:32:21,"Although I am only average at this game (16 demons) I still love it. There are endless possibilities with triggers and move commands, which makes some levels VERY unique. Also that feeling when you finally beat the demon you’ve been working on for weeks is amazing. BUT this game will only ever be fun for you if you are good at it. If you can’t beat, say, clubstep, you will likely get bored. My advice is to play for about a month, then stop playing for a bit. When you come back you will be better than you were before. Again, I love this game, but it’s only fun if you’re decent at it.",Lovin’ it
5,2017-04-25 01:32:43,"This is the God App. It has tons of features, like  *Map Packs, which are packs that help you get better at the game  *Gauntlets, which are the new 2.1 islands of death to test your skills. Great rewards await at the end!  *Demon Guardian + Demon Keys, which to get the keys to free the Demon Guardian, you must complete the Chaos Gauntlet, open 50 chests in the brand new treasure room, and unlock the Chamber of Time to obtain the 3rd key.  A lot more! There's:  *Level Creator - This is the best feature for me. It allows you to create your own GD levels and share them to the community!  *Classic Levels are the normal levels, like Stereo Madness, for example. Fingerdash is the brand new 2.1 classic level, which is surprisingly quite fun!  *Game modes - There's not just cube, but ship, ball, wave, UFO, dual,  spider, mini, and robot. They also have death effects and trails for you to get!  Ok, I think that's enough, even though there's way, WAY more. Even though this app costs $1.99, it is TOTALLY worth it!",This app is worth it
5,2017-03-15 12:03:45,"I have stuck with this app since the popularity rush in 2015. Since then I have only been able to play the user levels due to the lack of main levels. I suggest you, the creator, make a contest between the top 100 creators. Each person makes an easy and a difficult level. At the end of the contest. The users decide on one easy level and one hard level. The person who made the level gets a unique icon or something. This would allow for levels that are user based and share the qualities the user desires.  Please do this 😬🤡",Contest
3,2023-10-16 04:03:54,"This review isn’t about the game itself. Don’t get me wrong, the game itself is incredible. The reason my rating is 3 stars Is because when I try to open the game, it instantly crashes. I’ve seen some reviews talking about the same problem. But this has been going on at least from Monday. I just got the game today and was really disappointed because I couldn’t enjoy it because of that glitch. If RobTop hasn’t noticed this problem, I just want to be another review that will become a stepping stone to the big fix. Please, RobTop. FIX THE GAME.

Oh yeah, I also have 90% on Electrodynamics. I just don’t get how I’ve beaten Theory of Everything 2 that I just got like five weeks ago and I have not beaten Electrodynamix. in my opinion, the hardest part in a literal dynamics, is the part where you have to go up and down in the rocket ship. I’ve gotten past it only a few times. But if im lucky 🍀 maybe In 2.2 the 🚀 ship will be easier to control. Thx Bye!",Wow 😮

4,2017-11-25 22:02:07,"So there’s a bug that really annoys me, it’s when I touch the screen and the vehicle doesn’t work. I call it ship malfunction because it mainly happens on the ship. (its originally vehicle malfunction) Its really annoying because I get close to the end of a hard level get on a vehicle part and then it and you click then it doesn’t work leading you to death. I then experimented it on edit mode where I did a fairly easy straight fly, which malfunctioned, a ufo with spikes around it, which again, malfunctioned, a easy wave that malfunctioned again. Robot, ball, and spider did not though. I really hope you fix this is the next update",This bug
5,2020-10-13 22:03:47,This game is so fun you are going to have to play this you were going to love it because you can make your own levels I never could do that in the first Geometry Dash like it was so boring that you couldn’t make your own levels in the first one like it would be like oh I just finished all the levels it’s OOOUUU exciting wow yeah like that’s boring you’re gonna love this game even though it’s one dollar that does it mean it’s it’s expensive like it’s just an awesome game I can tell you that and you can play what people have me too,The Best game ever in existence
5,2018-11-25 00:28:49,"I started playing in 2014 or so back when the game was still taking it’s steps into the world. Geometry Dash is a great game. To all of you that want to purchase this game, her’s the pros and cons:  PRO: It never gets old. TBH I never completed the default levels. But the gauntlets, the map packs, demons, all give you something to do.  CON: Community. The community can get pretty harsh and showed up in multiple arguments against this game. But RobTop doesn’t choose the community, and we can change the cruelty.  PRO: Simple. Simplicity rarely works for games. It works here. The simplicity of a cube jumping over a spike is something anyone can do and anyone can master with some work.  CON: Not very much updates. It’s been over 2 years since RobTop announced 2.2 and it still hasn’t come out. It gets annoying to wait so long for 2.2, and many players have quit. But RobTop is a one-man crew and he has a life too.  Decide for yourself if Geometry Dash is the right game for you.",Honest Review
5,2018-09-03 13:44:09,"This game is AMAZING!!!! At first I thought this game was just annoying and boring but when my friend came over with the game I tried it and thought WOW!!!! This game is amazing! And when I got it... I like... almost freaked out when I saw that one of my levels had over 10,000 likes! And then I realized this was not a game that will disappoint me. And I’m glad about that! But maybe you should add a demon that you don’t have to unlock and then I’d be happier about it! Thank you! And please make the game 9+ cause my little brother is always playing the game and not spending any time with the family! Thanks!",Amazing!
5,2018-01-20 16:05:58,"This game, no denying it, is a legendary game, no in-game bugs/glitches. Perfect gameplay and unique graphics. Interesting icons, ships, gravity balls, etc. My point here is saying that this game is worth the money. Every update RobTop makes is even better than the last, 10/10 quality, recommended to gamers who like action, a good challenge, and a ton of fun! Levels sponsored by RobTop, to levels made by creators all over the world create their own levels that may get rated. Anyone has a chance to create a great game in the community.

4,2017-01-22 01:29:46,"I have never before taken the time to sit down and write a review for a game. However, for some reason, I found compelled to do so for this.  I've been playing this game since 1.9, falling in and out of obsession over the years. I got back into the game when the 2.1 hype train built up steam last year. There was such a long period of time that the community felt anxious waiting for the new update. And while it left a sour taste in some fans' mouths, GD World did nothing but whet my appetite. I loved the new gameplay and aesthetics, and was SO ready for the new update.   But now that it's out, I have to admit I'm a bit frustrated. The improvements to the gameplay and editor are still marvelous, but there are so many broken mechanics. My gauntlets won't load, my quests won't load, I can't access the Chamber of Time no matter WHERE I click on the screen, and daily rewards won't load. It's just a bit frustrating to wait so long and have so many of the new features bugged.   Itsstillgreatthoso4starssorry.",Ehh....
4,2021-12-22 01:50:39,"Okay I absolutely love this game. Been playing it for years. Never really had a problem. Until Apple released it new 15 update. Maybe the developer of the app could release an update in which is compatible with this new apple update release. As ever since I updated my phone, the app no longer works at all. Would really be great if I could play this game again. I have tried every tutorial possible to try and fix the game and make it work, but at this point it’s the app itself that needs to be updated.

5,2023-06-18 19:19:16,"Gd is overall a good game. It’s like a mix of games. You can create and play online levels. You can play the main levels, and the songs are pretty catchy. There are bonuses like the gatekeeper, keemaster, that other guy, and the demon guardian. It has a storyline too. You can visit the shop or get achievements to unlock icons. There is also a few other small versions of the game, like meltdown, world, and subzero. Btw the video for gd is pretty old so don’t think that the game is not good based off of the video, although the basics are in the video.",Amazing
3,2022-12-31 21:07:36,"So I recently got back in to the game. It was fun, but shortly I took notice that every time I touched the phone screen it would cause my game to freeze for a split second. But with plenty of jumps tied together, it would cause the sound to never sync, and the game would have major lag spikes. It started to bug me, so I ended up putting on playing it on pause until I can figure out why it’s occurring, or if a fix will come out.  Update: still hasn’t been fixed. It’s next to unplayable now. I looked up forums and other stuff to try and fix this issue or bug but I can’t. Please fix this so I can return to my love of Demon levels.",Good but glitchy

And most of all I would like for there to be 120hz support for the iPad pro because whenever I play this on my gaming computer which has support for 144hz it makes a BIG difference in the clarity of the game. Thank you so much for making this game! :)",Just 2 improvements.
5,2020-07-17 07:08:18,"Geometry Dash is a platform game where you dodge spikes and obstacles in different modes and levels. Geometry Dash is an addicting game and I recommend you buy it, as it is very worth the money. Geometry Dash keeps you entertained for hours with many features, such as daily levels, weekly demons, the main levels, a huge community of players constantly uploading levels, in fact over 50 levels are uploaded every minute. The game includes a free to use creator to make whatever you desire. I truly think Geometry Dash is a great game and a Must-Have if you don’t have it already.",Addictive!
5,2019-10-24 19:04:55,"So I’ve been playing Gd for about 2 years now, quitting for a bit but getting back into it like at the beginning of 2019, and I love it! It’s such a good game, the music, the levels, of course some ppl do put bad stuff there, but parents shouldn’t worry about it too much, I’ve been playing it at least a little bit at least once a day. My acc is aj77 and I now have 2000+ stars and 60+ demons on mobile! Thank you for making this game :)) Only thing is that the updates take too long, but I’m fine with that. There’s new stuff being made every day. Keeps me cool 😎",:D I love this!
4,2022-12-07 20:56:19,"I have had geometry dash for a while now (almost a year) and there is one bug that is just annoying. So this is only sometimes but sometimes when I touch the screen it won’t register the touch and I just die. I won’t even touch it lightly, I touch like I always do but it won’t register my touch. This bug has just made it harder to beat levels. Sometimes on rare occasion it will register the touch but then it will not jump and I die. So please fix it and it will make the game a whole lot better. Besides that, this game is amazing and involves lots of strategy.",Bugs
5,2019-03-04 03:36:45,"Well, when I played this, I was like, “Wow! This must be cool!” As I started playing this, this app inspired me to create some music on my own! My mother said, “Don’t play that app, it hurts your eyes,” and I thought, true..but it inspired me to create music.. I hadn’t told about my family about creating music or being inspired by an app. 4 years later, I was ready to tell them. After when I told them, they were amazed on how I’ve been inspired on some app- Not just A app. It’s an AMZING APP! - They were really happy for me, and I hope you get to play this app too, and get inspired on the music.",A Challenge for Your Eyes
5,2023-09-07 05:56:16,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. I’ve been playing it since 2015 across many devices and accounts and I never felt bad about restarting, because I love playing it so much. It exposed me to new music and a satisfying display of colors and shapes. The fact you can create your own levels is amazing too. You should have zero doubts in downloading this game. It’s a fun reaction game with electronic music that u will never get tired of. Even if it doesn’t update often, I love the content that is already there!",Classic mobile game
4,2021-03-13 02:28:35,"When I started Geometry Dash, the first thing I did was play the first level, Stereo Madness. But, I cannot get past it. I'm very stuck at the last part and I think you should have made the first levels easier. Stereo Madness made me rage many times, and throw my IPad. I think you should have probably made them like lessons to learn how to play. When I started, I had no clue how to use the ship and I'm still getting used to it. In Stereo Madness, there's a ship part right there. Levels with lessons in them would've been better. And you should put them in Gd Lite, as well. I hope you take my message seriously.",Easier starting levels
5,2022-04-13 23:58:26,Geometry Dash is one of my favorite games on iOS but when the new update came out it would not let me go into the actual game I cannot play any of the levels and I wanted to continue the level that I was building I refresh many many times and nothing happened and I deleted a reinstalled many times too but it still wouldn’t work I feel like Rob top needs to do something but I still love Geometry Dash and I will never forget about it even if I can’t play it,A good game but somethings are not right on mobile
5,2021-12-20 04:28:17,"I started this game by playing the free versions: “Meltdown”, “SubZero”,”Geometry Dash Lite”, and “Geometry Dash World”. When i got the dull version, I became obsessed. Creating, custom levels,Great official levels, gauntlets, map packs, secrets, vaults, quests?! Theres just so much to explore! Its just such a fun game, and I absolutely love it. This is why i ended up crying because gd broke on my device beyond repair. I couldnt join! Anyways, geometry dash is a great game that i greatly recommend to all. If you dont like it, that’s perfectly fine! You have your own opinion, and thats all that matters.",Gd is da absolute best!

This is why I love this game, the ability to do whatever I feel makes me happy. Although, I have one complaint: While playing as the wave game mode, after a while the trail behind bugs out and doesn’t work, when I play levels I like based off of wave game mode I always have this bug. I hope that this is updated and fixed soon because I have died so many to times because of incoordination between my trail and my thumb. 4/5 stars.",I love this game but…
5,2021-02-20 15:54:53,"When I went to upload a level it would never work. When I went to upload the level, it would show a explanation point saying that the upload failed and to try again latter.

5,2023-10-13 16:53:06,"I really enjoy playing this game but other is a glitch making the that hard for me to do that. I can’t see leader boards, get rewards, play levels made by other players, publish my own levels, and pretty much connect to the internet through the game. The devs probably won’t see this but it is worth a try.  Update: I played today and it worked fine I had deleted it previously but it did not work. But for some reason today I downloaded it and it worked fine",Bad glitch
5,2023-07-27 16:43:42,Listen I absolutely LOVE this game but sometimes the levels that robtop make are just so hard they frustrate me until I beat it. And then the same thing with the next level. I’ve gotten over the frustration lately but sometimes I spend hours trying to beat a level until I give up for the day but I seriously think you should download this if you haven’t already. Definitely one of my favorite games I will ever play. Oh and Robtop if you are reading this keep up the great work:),Fun but frustrating
4,2022-05-19 21:35:37,This game is good if not one of the best rhythm games out there but I just don’t know what to do know that I can’t play any custom levels. It’s hard to play custom levels because none of them pop up when I search them. If someone can help me it would mean the world to me because I really want to enjoy this game while having the ability to play custom levels. (One more thing. I searched it up on my phone and saw that you have to disable browsing protection but idk if iOS has anti virus or not and it seemed to have only worked for PC.),Good but can’t play more custom levels
5,2023-01-02 23:25:33,"geometry dash is very fun, the levels are fun and have really good music, and it really gives you a feeling of accomplishment once you beat a level youve been struggling on for a long time. The icons, ships, ufos, balls, arrows, and spider skins look amazing and are fun and challenging to collect. even after you beat every level you can do online levels so the game pretty much never ends. overall probably the best game and the full game is only 3 dollars. not just that, but i haven’t experienced a single bug or glitch ever while playing this",best game ever
5,2022-11-24 04:28:32,"When I first started playing this game, it was amazing! I loved it! I would go on about how good this game is, but that’s not the point of the review. Instead, the point of this review is that a while after I stopped playing (Don’t worry, I probably just lost interest, nothing too bad), I tried to start playing again, and the second I opened up the app, I just got booted out. I really hope this glitch gets fixed, if it even is a glitch, and not just something weird with my device.","Amazing, but something’s wrong?"
5,2022-01-07 05:13:51,I am trying to play on IPhone X but it does not work. It opens the game and then immediately closes the game. I went to check if I needed a update but but I did not. And then I checked the update history and it said IPhone X support and I am sad to admit that even with that patch I still cannot play geo dash. I am still giving 5 stars because I know it is a really fun game. This started a couple months ago and I stopped playing because of it. Then I come back to see if it is fixed and it is not. Please fix this,Cannot play
5,2019-08-11 17:08:43,"I’ve been playing 3 years, ever since I got an iPad. Me and my best friend became bonded over this game. Lots of respect to RubRub; people don’t know how hard it is to make and maintain one of the top games on the App Store all on your own, and stay active in the community at the same time. Possibly updates could be a little less ambitious in the future, but when millions of people are pressing you to add new things, it’s hard to say no. This is 100% my favorite game of all time. It’s difficult but with lots of practice you can get really good at the game.",This game is pretty much my childhood
5,2019-04-25 17:28:36,"I'm 10 years old, and this is my favorite game. Despite bugs, and the fact that the updates take absolutely forever, this game is flawless. Ignore those cranky 8 year olds saying stereo madness is too hard! It may be hard for you at first, or you could beat level 1 on your 2nd attempt. Once you get used to it, you either love it or hate it. The online feature adds 3 stars. The level editor is awesome as well, but making levels is hard. I'm actually getting bored writing this review, because i just wanna get back to playing Geometry Dash!",Flawless.
5,2017-07-03 04:16:20,This is the most amazing game I have ever seen. I used to devote time to other games. Now I am glued to the screen of this game. The graphics in the game are unbelievable. There are so many different game modes that have endless hours of fun. But that's the gameplay. There are also a million different ways to design your icon. The difficulty in the game is ungodly. And you do not know how many times I wanted to smash my iPad into the wall. But it is completely worth it. The music is also godlike. From the easy levels to the demons. Geometry dash will carry you through.,Geometry dash!

I love the challenge it has, it takes time to beat but it gives you such a great feeling once you have beaten all 21 levels!! Even so, you also feel accomplished when you just beat 1 level. This game is so much fun, and there aren’t any complaints from me! If you like a challenge, this game is totally for you! I love how you can cutomize your cube, too!

I usually switch from pc to my phone for certain levels or if I go somewhere and I recently made a level on my phone because I hadn’t been home for 2 weeks. I recently tried saving my data to the cloud so I could finish the level on my computer but it kept failing over and over telling me to “try again later” I waited an hour then a day then 2 days but it still wouldn’t save. Can I get some help? (Also before I attempted saving, I saved my progress the week before and it worked then so I’m confused as to why it’s not working now.)",Mr TopRob

I was also extremely irritated that they use AI to display the workout people are doing. Furthermore, I am also sad that it is not user friendly and has many in app purchases. It needs my email just to make an account. They could be selling my data and we do not know. Finally, this app is very limited in many ways I will not go into, but let me say, you don't want to hear it. I would suggest wii sports over this app which is available on the wii. I would even suggest geometry dash over this app, because you sweat when you play it. All of this is why I'm giving it 5 stars.",Ye ururhfj

Can you get this fixed because I’ve been on mobile playing the level Cycles and it has been a MONTH, and I still can’t beat it because of this exact reason. Plus I keep getting cut short (timed my jump to where I know I will land on the platform and then somehow I won’t make it). This really aggravates me but, I absolutely love your game just for us people on mobile have this problem (or might be only me?). Either have the game fixed please or my rating won’t change over the reason of lag.

5,2019-03-07 04:35:34,Ok this game is my absolute favorite and i cant wait until the next update! But since it has been over a year since the last update im hoping to see at least 4 new levels. I dont like the online levels as much because they dont have the same quality as your guys. I want 1 demon 2 extreme and 1 harder level. Im running out of things to do in this game and i would like to see those new levels. It would mean a lot to me and i would like a response on how long it will be until the next update. Thank you so much for this game!,Love this game. But..
5,2018-02-02 22:53:18,"If your like me... you will play this game for hours and hours. So many talented creators building levels for people to enjoy, not to mention the 21 original RobTop Levels. I’d recommend this game for anyone and I repeat ANYONE!! The character customization is great. I like how people work to unlock the icons instead of getting them from the start. And with the addition of the shops. We can also buy icons as well as icons people made from the community shop. This game has greatly improved over the years.

But recently I went ahead and downloaded the Lite edition to try it out and then I decided I liked it enough to get the full version so I bought it and excitedly tapped on the app. But as soon as I tap on it, it opens for about one or two seconds then immediately crashes, I have completely powered down my phone and done everything I could think of to get the app to work with no avail. There is a possibility that it is simply my phone considering it is an older version (iPhone7) but if anyone else has experienced this and managed to fix it, it would be a huge help, thank you!",Error

Now I’m stuck playing the lite one, BUT IT IS LAGGIER THAN EVER! So now I’m wondering if the developer can help with this bug issue. So without the glitch, I played this game almost all the time.",Used to play it all the time
2,2022-09-01 09:05:58,"Game idea is very interesting but level difficulty is unbalanced. Especially a level called Clutterfunk, it’s too hard to beat. I tried 1030 attemps and still didnt beat it. But the next level feels pretty easy. Game itself is cool, I would recommend anyone this game, but once you get to a certain level it gets frustrating. Sometimes I just wanna quit playing this game because it’s so addictive in a negative way. Once you die just before beating a level, you try again again until you realize the time is flying and you still dont beat the level you were playing. Sometimes it lags all of a sudden just before the finish line. I hope Robtop fixes that.",Maybe.. meh?
3,2022-04-01 02:58:12,"This game is great, it has its own levels and a gallery with custom levels. You can create your own levels, you can make anything with it! Until this problem happened... I was opening geometry dash and it showed the loading screen like always but then it sent me to my home screen. I tried again the same thing happened, I tried again and the same thing happened again... then I tried one more time, and then, THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. So I shut my tablet off, didn't work, closed the app out, didn't work, powered off my tablet, and guess what… DIDN'T WORK. So after that I just played different games... forgetting about it.  1 YEAR OR SO LATER I re-open the app, and... IT HAPPENS AGAIN. I try deleting the app off my home screen, didn't work, deleting all its data, didn't work... after that, I just gave up.

5,2020-12-15 20:27:29,"First things first, the game is ridiculously hard. Once you get used to the controls, it’s significantly easier, which is nice. Second of all, the community is amazing. People have managed to coordinate together, and make levels beyond the imagination of what people see in the original 21 levels. I have been learning to create recently, and have received some helpful feedback from excellent creators with a few CP as well. Excellent game, worth much more than the selling price.

3,2020-05-14 00:12:45,I love geometry dash it’s a really fun game and yesterday morning I was talking to my dad and I hope you creators do this I wish ya could make a geometry dash where u have to jump one spike and everything is completed everything is unlocked except chests and the things in the shop and there is infinity orbs and infinite stars and coins and those keys and u can get all the crystals and it will tell u the answer the questions from the lock all the doors are open and that would be great and so you know my name in geometry dash is ghost pepper thank you so much love doge gamer (it’s me from a few days ago hi and uh hehe can one of u tell me if the creators say something pls that would be great thx!!!!),Can u make a new game pls

5,2017-03-31 00:07:50,"I absolutely adore this game! I've loved it since I got it! It's even got me to thinking of suggestions for 2.2  1: Use ""Ichor"" from xTrullor. This is probably one of the best songs I've heard of. It's perfect for level building, and just fun to listen to in general.  2:Side-Flip Portals(?). Just an idea, maybe you could create a portal that rotates the screen. Like forward now is up, back is now the floor, etc. but you still follow the same path. Like the flip portals from Time Machine.  3: New Move abilities.  A) Don't know if you'll need a new trigger for this, but you can set it up to where the player itself can slide selected blocks, but can only move them in a certain area created by the creator of the level.  B) Lock to Screen. Instead of an object just following your every move, you can make it lock onto that area of a screen!  You don't have to do all of this, or any of this, these are just suggestions.",2.2 Ideas
5,2017-02-06 13:25:39,"This is my favorite game. It has awesome music, gameplay, features, and more! ...But there's just one small problem. Whenever I go to my account to write a message, it doesn't show my characters, and I can't write anything there. This is a problem for me because I like to be unique and stuff like that. So maybe in version 2.11, you could fix that bug? I always have a strong wi-fi connection when I try, but it shows the same thing every time. Otherwise, this game is AWESOME!!!

RobTop actually takes recommendations from the community, which I think is very cool. There are so many things you could do in the editor, whether it’s a crappy recent tab level or the likes of White Space by Xender Game. Overall, the game is great. I hope 2.2 comes out soon.",Good

I’m not confident that it will ever be released. I’m sure the idea has been nice for Rob, but I think it’s just a fantasy. I really hope I’m wrong, but for now the game is still going on the sideline for me. I’ve been checking back about every 3 months and still no 2.2.

4,2019-12-25 21:08:27,So I like geometry dash and I was playing since 1.9 before I made my account I like geometry dash but it needs some changes. So I think Robtop should remove the level editor glitch. Every time I try to build and play test my level it is just frozen. I can still play test but I can’t build in my level. I want you to fix it. Another thing I want this game to fix is that you just don’t rate that much levels. I sometime take weeks and it does not work. I wish that would work too that if the level has more than 10 likes then it could be rated. Thanks for reading.,Good but need some changes
5,2020-05-07 12:02:31,"This game is a really fun game to play, when I have nothing to do. I really like it how you can play other people’s levels, and other stuff like that, and that you can build your own levels, too.  The only problem I have with this game is that recently I lost my sound in the game. The sound effects are all the way up, same with the music, but it’s not working. I don’t know if this is my problem, but is it possible for you to fix it some time soon?  Other than that, I love this game. :)",Great game!

And also some songs are inappropriate for children that people use in there levels that are older. You should fix that. This games rated 4+. 4+! 2 that you can type in WHATeVER YOU WANT IN CHaT, LEVEL NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS IN ThE LEVELS!!!

I’ve been working on the level for months and it had (animation, rotation, changing lights, etc.) AND ALL MY HARD WORK WAS PUT TO SCRAP BECAUSE YOU CANT HAVE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF ROOM LIKE YOU CAN FOR THE CUBE!

5,2018-10-06 16:14:14,"Hey RobTop, just wanted to say that Geometry Dash is getting very boring and all of us in the Geometry Dash community have been waiting for 10 months now. Is 2.2 coming out? Or not? We just all want to know, because you have not given us any clues or anything to let you know that you are still working on the update. Guitar, Souls, Viprin, EVW, Shaggy, etc. are all waiting for this update. 2.2 would make GD not boring anymore and we would really appreciate it if you would just let us know if you’re working on the update still, or if you gave up on the game.",2.2 when?
3,2023-07-14 21:30:39,"Geometry dash is one of my favorite nostalgic games at the moment. However, after updating the phone I was using to play on, the game stopped opening. I decided to get the game on my computer but for my account to be in the dame state it was on the phone, I needed to get onto the phone (save and load icloud thing). I was devastated. The entire reason I bought the game on steam was because it wasn’t working on mobile. Geometry dash still doesn’t work and i’m not sure why. App support doesn’t work either. Tutorials online don’t help. I would’ve given this five stars if it hadn’t been for the fact it won’t open.",The best game
4,2022-09-15 19:22:10,"Recently i broke my iPad that had Geometry Dash and after i got it replaced something went quite off. When i downloaded Geometry Dash again i would tap on the app and it would open for a couple of seconds and disappear right there. I have no sure idea what happened but im thinking its due to the update for 15.0 or something. You probably wont see this but, is this problem fixable? If possible please attempt when it’s time's turn. But before all of this, the game was amazing. Just, don't take too long for 2.2 either.",Something happened…
3,2022-10-29 21:30:37,"1: add blue arrow, it makes you go up and down. 2: add purple orb and pad, it will work like spider, except with other modes. 3: speaking of modes, multiplayer! You will race with other people in featured maps. 4: more types of in and out triggers (no one knows how to use them, except some people, so you can ignore this one(don’t actually tho)). 5: backwards with normal camera, and camera staying in place. I think you know what I cuz people have been asking for generations. 6: free fly mode, you know what I mean. 7: zooming trigger, a trigger that zooms in and out. 8: MORE SCREEN FILTERS BRUH. 9: offset camera. brings the camera somewhere else. THAT IS ALL I COULD THINK OF, ok?",some ideas
4,2021-11-26 11:42:39,"Ok let’s be real, you’re probably never going to read this, but there’s this problem with your game. The problem is that whenever I try to go into geometry dash either with my phone or iPad, it crashes the second I enter. That includes subzero, world, lite, and this game. I like this game, because I usually play on my computer, but when I’m gone, I just can’t resist playing this game. Also some reason Meltdown is the only one that actually works. Besides that I’m going to say this game is one of my favorite games I’ve ever came across, Thanks Rob.  Peace out.",Geometry dash isn’t working
4,2020-04-15 20:29:24,"So I have been playing this game for over a year and it’s pretty fun. I like the levels and the updates and I like how you can build a level like this game has so much to do, Just there is a few problems but overall this game is 10 out of 10. So, Here I the problems with the game. The first one is probably what everyone else is talking about. When is 2.2 coming out. Second, That geometry dash website has been under construction for years. Lastly, Some buttons do absolutely nothing. So that’s it. I highly recommend this game to people who like a challenge. Alright bye now!",Good game but... WHEN IS 2.2 COMING
5,2021-05-19 00:24:14,"So I am a mobile player and have been playing for quite a while but I have recently been trying to beat deadlocked. My record is 62 and I have done about 6,000 attempts. have been starting to get mad because there is a bug on the ball part at 38 where you go into the teleportation portal and it kills you immediately. Now I love this game and love deadlocked but I keep and getting frustrated at that, so if you see this rob top pls fix this whether it is a 30hz bug or it is just how you hit the portal✌🏿",Deadlocked Bug
5,2020-12-19 13:11:49,"I just wanna say this game is so amazing and fun and there is absolutely no way to get bored on this app but I have some problems. Ever since move triggers came out in 2.0 people have been using them in ways where it’s annoying and plain stupid, I don’t blame robtop for this though, just a little problem with some levels. Another thing I really don’t like Is some overrated creators that I can’t remember the names of. One creator made pinnacle by optical but with worse gameplay and it got epic. Seriously?  Everything else in this game is so fun.",just a few problems
4,2017-01-19 21:37:26,"Outstanding. However, the game has some problems. Most of the time when I try to play, it will not load my daily chests, profile or online levels. I play on both the steam version and on mobile, and it's becoming increasingly difficult. One more thing that is just a personal thought is that you should get orbs from the levels you have beaten before 2.1 came out. It's kind of fun to replay the levels but it's still kinda lame. I can see why it doesn't give you orbs though, you would have an insane amount of orbs and demon keys. Love you rubrub, but please fix the issues asap <3",Loading...
5,2018-01-25 19:51:42,"The game is very nice smooth gameplay and you can play levels made by others and you can create good levels and send a message to a moderator to see if you can get your levels rated! Maybe you can be the top and beat Demons! Like Clubstep, Deadlocked ETC. But my favorite part of the game is that you can get some friends and be in a call and race to see who can build the best level first or who can beat all the main levels first. But wouldn’t recommend for people who have anger issues.",Great game for being creative and playing other levels
5,2022-12-22 00:22:10,"Ok, first of all, I just want to say that I love this game, and I kinda prefer it over the pc version. It’s 100% worth the 2 bucks. A lot of people have been having a bug, however, which boots them out of the game being unable to play it, but you should be fine as long as your phone is relatively new (iPhone 10 or better) My suggestion is that there should be a setting for the attempt counter at the start of the letter to show total attempts, not just attempts for the session.",Suggestion
5,2022-06-25 22:04:50,I love geometry dash there is just a few little things that would make this game a lot better than it allready is.  The first one is that every time I exit the game and the come back the music doesn’t work. The second thing is I got a new phone and all of my levels and coins and stars and basically everything from my old phone didn’t transfer to my new phone when I signed in but otherwise this is an amazing game and is so fun to play❤️❤️❤️ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Rub rub pls read
1,2022-08-05 08:14:47,"I bought the game a few weeks ago, but since I got it I haven’t been able to play. Every time I try to open the app, the game will crash before it even finishes showing the name. I’ve tried closing the app, deleting and reinstalling, restarting my phone, and who knows what else but nothing has been working. I’ve seen my friends play it and it looked fun, but what’s the point of getting and paying for the game if I can’t even play it? Please fix this soon, and anyone looking to buy this, it’s better not to until the bug is fixed, as based on other recent reviews I’m not the only one experiencing this.  TL;DR  game doesn’t open/crashes, do not buy until the issue is fixed",Crashes when I try to open the app
5,2021-11-28 21:31:18,"I’d like to thank all of the creators of Geometry Dash for all of the hard work they put into this game. I love it so much! When traveling, or mostly when I’m bored, I’m always in some version of Geometry Dash! I sort of want a new update, or a change to some part of the game, it hasn’t been updated in a while. There is a few glitches, but I don’t feel I need to say them because other commenters already said them. Any way, thank you so much for this great game! I love it so so much! I ❤️ Geometry Dash!                Bye for now!",Awesome!
5,2019-09-24 15:07:03,Ok I love geometry dash as much as anyone would. And I am still learning to beat levels. And trying to complete my goal to beat every single offline level. But then you see here’s the problem.... the jump delays sometimes that kills me 99% of the time. Like in time machine. I was at 88% but a jump delayed and made me fall into a spike pit. After I noticed that delay it happens to me almost every time I try to beat a level. It’s just that I can’t progress in the game. I hope you really take this seriously and fix this in your next update.,Five star but
4,2022-12-11 16:34:57,"This game is really good, but I have couple of problems with the game. First the weekly demons are unplayable on mobile because of lag / storage issues. Next, we have been waiting 5 YEARS for 2.2 and a lot of people are starting to hate the game. Also Geometry Dash isn’t available for iPhone 8 or earlier so please make home button phones compatible with the game. But that means you only get to play about 15 levels TOTAL with only SubZero, Meltdown, and World. Anyways, this is a really good game, but it just needs some fixes. Bye RobTop!",Needs a little bit of fixing 🔧
5,2018-08-11 06:50:23,"This game is pretty good and have a lot of incredible things that the developer have added I think this game might be the best one I’ve ever played since I was 5 years old anyways your not my dairy and I’m not gonna tell you my life.. I totally recommend the game a lot it’s just 1.99 but it’s great I also haven’t seen any bugs glitches and any bother technical problems in the game thank you RobTop for this awesome game you’ve made.

I mean, my mom’s coffee is more than that! Lots of other games like Candy Dash copied this, I think. So if you beat all of the levels, well, think again because if u get enough golden coins, u can unlock Clubstep, Theory of Everything 2, and Deadlocked. If u get all 3 coins in all levels (chances are rare), u can play levels created by other users. U can even make ur own levels! It’s totally worth more than $1.99.",Definitely get it!!!
5,2023-10-15 21:53:42,This game has to be one of my favorite games of all time and would love to keep playing it. The only issue is that iOS 17 doesn’t work on this. Heard people talking about the game only being a 32 bit game and iOS 17 can only support 64 bit but that isn’t even the issue for that. If you see the Robtop. Hopefully the next update (2.2) will be released here pretty soon so that the game can stop kicking me out every time. I can also try to contact apple for help but that’s all. Thank you,Game issue

For such a small game, it has a much bigger community run area where people can work together or compete or just mess around, a level editor, so you can publish things you make, and at least 3 years of fun, because my friend has been playing for 3 years and he still likes it as much as I do.

Whenever I try and open geometry dash it shows a black screen and then instantly crashes. I don’t know if this has to do with my phone, because my phone is an older model of phone( before iPhone X) so maybe the aspect ratio messes up because I have a smaller phone screen. But now I can’t play this game and I’ll have to wait for it to be patched before I can play on mobile.",One small bug

4,2022-07-21 00:36:20,"I’ve noticed that once I leave the app and come back, the audio tends to disappear until I fully reset the game which can be kind of annoying sometimes. Also, I am quite annoyed with the fact that I can’t create a new account with the same email as my old one. I recently lost my account info and I no longer have my password, so I am unable to login, but I can’t create a new account now because it won’t let me have two accounts with the same email.

This goes the same for subzero and everything else.

Update (March 25, 2022): So I got a new iPhone (XR) recently and I haven’t had the problem with it crashing anymore. Seemed to be an iOS issue, so guys I see a lot of you can’t open the game.

Geometry Dash is a rage game, there are multiple levels in the game and many made by the community. You are a little icon that has to jump through obstacles and avoid dying.

5,2020-10-23 01:57:32,Geometry Dash is an amazing game with more than several things to do and I started playing last year. Even though it can be quite stressful it’s still really fun. I love how you’re able to make custom levels for many people to play and it amazes me to see how well made these levels are. However it’s been so long since we’ve had an update and I’ve been starting to fell as if Robtop has given up. I know he hasn't but I don’t think an update would take almost 3 years to make. Really fun game but needs an update.,Amazing but stressful
4,2019-05-20 00:50:22,"This game, on its core level, is amazing. In fact, the gameplay variety is almost endless! From a fast paced demon level that you can’t wrap your head around, to a casual, slower easy level for beginners. There is only one flaw, but it’s a big one. The majority of the levels are made by people interested in the game, and when the developer isn’t keeping the community alive and adding new content, it becomes stale. RobTop was not working on 2.2 after 2.11, and instead... he made a game with ads as a “sneak peek,” whilst a group of people already finished a mod of the game for 2.2.  Overall, though, it’s a pretty good game.","Eh, good"

4,2022-09-21 22:33:57,Hi robtop I am really angry about this glitch on iPhone 8 which makes it impossible to play. The second my game starts it automatically closes and I have tried many ways to get it to start but it just won’t so for 2.2 can you make it more accessible for iPhone 8? Thanks a lot I’m saying this because it is my favorite game and not because of any other reason. Also the other versions of this work fine on my phone just not the paid for one so those are good just update the full version please.,Why is my game not working?!
5,2022-04-30 12:09:27,When I try to open the game I already have the full version I cant open if for some reason and It stays on the loading screen for 1 second and takes me back to my home page and I’ve re downloaded it several times and when I go to my apple settings for the geometry dash it doesn’t even appear I hope you can fix this thank u                                                               Kind regards                                                                Spacedog,Opening

Decided to come back to it, and it just.... doesn't work. The game literally won't open. It seems to crash every single time I open it. I deleted and reinstalled the app, and nothing. Game won't even load. This happened 5 months ago. Can I expect a fix for this bug anytime soon? Knowing the speed at which updates roll out, what with 2.2, I doubt I'll EVER be able to play this game again, but if by some magical wonder, it does work, it would be great to actually be able to play the game again.",Seriously?
5,2022-04-01 17:23:29,I think it ain’t better at this game is a very good game I should say why why you should say because it’s very good at its OK please please please I love this game I can’t believe it like I love it ever breaking my records last week I’ve been not doing that such good but now I’ve been doing great so please everyone please say it’s good I love it superduper much like why would I hate it well I love it instead so please tell me all about it it’s fine don’t just put ones are for the millionth like why would you hate it?,Love it so much

And when I go to check if geometry dash full version is available it just shows the name “robtop” then it closes. Like what is happening? Robtop please fix this glitch or something.","Great game but, I am so sad I cannot get into the game. Please fix it thanks"
5,2021-12-11 08:22:33,"I love this game, and all the sudden, when I open geometry dash, it just kicks me out. I think it’s because I downloaded IOS 15. IOS 15 said that some apps might won’t work. Out of all my apps and games, geometry dash had been selected. I tried looking up how I cure this, and I can only find something that says about powering off my iPad. I’ve tried that twice. It still doesn’t let me in. I’m very sad :( The summary is that I still love this game, but please try to fix what you can  Thanks!",Crashing :(
5,2020-11-05 17:05:10,"This is a really fun game that I’ve been playing for a long time, and people rate it one star just because they aren’t good at the game nor put time into the game. It’s a really fun game that can entertain you for quite a long time, but don’t expect to immediately be able to beat all of the levels in a few attempts. For a level called 8o it took me over a month to beat, but I didn’t give up and eventually beat it. Don’t give up cause if you eventually get good at the game you can beat some really hard levels too.",Fun

It’s been about 2 and a half years since the last major update, if that tells you something. I was so hyped for this update last year but it’s taken so long that I’ve lost hope for it. The problem is that you (the dev) need to work with a team instead of a solo developer. Someone can make a whole game faster than you can release an update!",Updates take too long
5,2020-06-24 23:15:30,Been playing for 5 years and I’m not stopping any time soon. I play this game every day and I never get bored of it. I’ve gotten over 120 demons and I’m 1 achievement away from having all the achievements. I love creating even though I know my levels won’t get rated. With other games I get bored fast but this game has so much to offer that it’s always there for me to play. I’m not really worried about when 2.2 is coming out but one thing I would say is to add key binds for creating.,My favorite game
4,2019-06-12 18:25:06,I just want to make this short so when your doing any level in geometry dash on some of the jumps when you press your screen to jump it doesn’t allow you to jump. For example I was on the level jumper and I was close to the portal and I just needed to jump so then i pressed my screen to jump and it didn’t allow me to so I died in the spikes. Before I end I just wanted to say overall this game is good like how you can make your own levels and let your friends play on them and see if they can beat it and designing your own avatar is cool to.,Tiny more work but still fun
5,2018-07-30 16:47:18,"Oh I love this game. The graphics and levels are just about endless! That means more improvement. It’s so fun just to play a simple level. Sometimes the rage of hard levels complete feels like forever victories! Either beating levels and claiming rewards, or making levels to grow the community, there is something for everyone. There are also apps like the full version. My account name is DiamondStreak0. Just go to search, type that in, and press the icon next to search. This game is great, trust me.

No matter what Wi-Fi I'm connected to, or no matter where I am, it just says ""Please try again later."" Every so often, the app crashes, and it really annoys me.

I have an iPhone 7.   Because of this, I can’t get several apps. iMovie, Google Photos (which I need to free up storage space), Garage Band, and more are inaccessible because of how long this update’s been taking.

This would be a five star if i could auctually play. please fix this i have been waiting for so long and all my hours of hard work and grinding is truely for nothing. i have been only playing other games and if you truely care about your players you will fix this glitch imediatly becuase i spent hours playing your game just for you to be a bad owner.,i no longer can play

Anyways this is a good game and I’m looking forward to 2.2 badly cause then 2.21 can come out and can add some of my improvements!

I’m just just ugh?! I am waiting. And I completed Xstep with 2 coins. The first one, and the third one. And I am gonna get another egg from Halloween. I got a car for the first one.

5,2018-05-14 01:08:22,The game as in gameplay is amazing!! The levels people can make and the possibility’s with the editor! Therefore some people are providing “copies” for their level so what others do is copy and upload and say it is theirs! RobTop has NOTHING to do with this not being perfect. It’s those people. The either make just a couple tiny tweaks and make it a different color maybe or they just do nothing! Now I’m not saying the community is ALL bad! There are more people who are GOOD players that deserve a better community! Not RobTop.. Community.,Great game.. Not so great community.

Such as sometimes you may try to tap on your mobile device sand when you try to jump or fly up the command does not do it. When you don’t tap or hold for some reason it jumps when you didn’t tap and you fly up when you didn’t tap. This is a very annoying issue and some people agree with me. This game is very good but bugs 🐛 are sill there and need to be fixed thank you for your time :).,Really good but some issues
5,2019-04-13 17:36:39,"Let me provide some context: About 95% of games on the App Store are shovelware, pure and simple. They’re usually very low quality and demand that you spend money at every turn. This game is NOT like those other games. You pay a few dollars upfront, and you’re left with an incredibly fun and well-designed game. It definitely deserves to be one of the top 5 paid apps on the App Store. In my opinion, it’s worth every penny. If you’ve been looking for a game that’ll keep you busy for a long time, this is the game for you.",One of the greatest!

But of you are probably out there DEAD and not making the update now.      I am starting to wonder if you are really DEAD, or you just don’t want to make the update AT ALL!

When I’m in the editor making a level that might even be feature worthy (wink wink ;)) It sometimes literally cuts the entire frame rate in HALF. I hate when this happens and the only way to fix it is to close the game, wait for a little bit, and then open the game again. And i might lose data in the level. So RubRub if you can fix this than I would highly appreciate it. Besides all that I just said great game and hope you get less of these in the future. Bye 8)",Good game but...
4,2017-04-15 10:59:46,"Hey i'm back for another review. GD has an invigorating gameplay. There are different modes, speeds, the works. I like the ideas of levels and UCL's, but even this game has flaws.  I feel found several.  1. Creating levels is a cumbersome task. It is also complicated. Trying to make something move requires tons of knowledge on pos'. Don't even ask me what those are.  2. This game may have practice, but it doesn't help. The gameplay may seem easy, but triple speed upside down ship ain't easy. I don't like that. You have pros, noobs, and a small tier of sophomores. I for one am a sophomore. I am neither good, or bad. The pros brag about their greatness, and the noobs beg to be noticed. The sophomores just sit training themselves. It's either get good or delete. Don't ask how to get good, because i don't know.  3. Creating an account. Oh boy. Your email (why is it needed?) will never be verified.  This explains it ALLL in a nutshell. See you on my next review.",It's either get good or else.

That’s only a minor issue. I would rate this 4.5 stars if I could. Anyways it’s a great game. Don’t forget to check out gladmacaroon560, and rate my levels. Plz",Good game. But some bugs

5,2023-10-02 01:24:37,I LOVEEEE THIS GAME! I started playing it in 2018 when my friends showed me it but I stopped playing it and lost my skill. I’m getting it back tho and I credited an account so my stuff saves. EVERYTHING IS SO NEW AND DIFFERENT BUT IT TOOK 6 YEARS FOR THE GAME TO GET UPDATED! I know it’s coming in October but robtop you need to step you’re updating game up. I know you have a personal life and all that but I love you’re game and I love the new things and I want new players to experience these new things! good job robtop and keep going on development!,I LOVE THIS GAME BUT THERES ONE FLAW
5,2023-05-23 22:00:25,This is the best game of all time I love it there is like no adds at all the only thing that some people might not like is that you have to pay for it but I think it is a reasonable price for how good the game is but if you want to see how the game is before you buy it I would definitely download geometry Dash lite it is still really good but I think just Geometry Dash is better in my opinion but I will definitely try Geometry Dash lite to make sure you actually like it.

That way you can make and publish your own levels, and even see others’ levels! And let me tell you - they can get REALLY good! And it’s not just creating - it’s also playing! Most levels are really fun and can draw you in, keeping you engaged. And yes, sometimes they can be frustrating and rage inducing, but you’ll want to keep playing!

It’s like the full version but with out no custom made levels and only StereoMadness to ClutterFlunk. It’s fun when you are bored! I’ve beaten 12 Demons so far! The song track is amazing!

5,2023-09-29 21:12:25,This game is really good it is challenging and fun also it doesn’t involve adds! One thing I don’t like is when you tap it sometimes doesn’t jump but not to brag but in Geometry dash SubZero I’ve finished nock’em and almost power trip and you guys probably know I’ve finished press stat obviously 🙄. But just for you know I think everyone should love this game like seriously ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD 👍     Okay if you read this thank you for taking your time to read it I hope u guys enjoy geometry dash as I do! 👍    Sincerely Jonny,SUPER GOOD ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I got this game a week ago and I already have 20+ hours of gameplay! :O I am extremely excited for 2.2’s release and I hope it doesn’t get delayed again! :) I have one quality of life suggestion. For selecting the demon difficulty, I think you should allow the player to select more than one demon difficulty if the player just wanted to filter out the easy or hard ones.

1,2022-02-05 07:42:34,"I, like many others just downloaded the game to play again for nostalgia's sake and it doesn't work. I click on the app to open, and it opens with the loading scream for a split second, and then immediately crashes. I'm super disappointed in this, because I've bought this before and it didn't do this back then. What's going on? Please fix this! I really want to play along side my little sister and it's so frustrating that I can't. I also tried the lite version of the game and it has the same issue. I only bought the full version again because of that issue, and it's having the same problem? I'm super dissatisfied. Please please fix this!",Game Doesn't Work Anymore..
4,2020-04-29 22:06:04,The game is frustratingly fun! I love the physics and gameplay perfect game to play on the go! Also the levels are so neat! The two problems are though is that sometimes I don’t jump for some odd reason and I hear a lot of other mobile players have had this bug as well. And the second is that if I put my correct email in to make an account it says “email invalid” even though it’s my correct email! That’s my problems though. But all in all it’s a good game! People who say this is bad are just rage quitters or are just bad. But thank you for making the game robtop! 😇,Great game!
1,2021-05-15 19:16:31,"I love this game don’t get me wrong but its basically unplayable now due to a glitch, or atleast I cannot play online. It started with me not being able to make an account, it always said the email wasn’t real that it didn’t exist even though it did. Then when I deleted and downloaded the game again all of a sudden i couldn’t access online. I searched up levels and nothing popped up. Not to mention i had to lose all my progress just to hope that deleting it would work just to find out it made it worse. It would be 5 stars for me if this glitch never happened but sadly it did and i quit the game after this since it was basically unplayable.",Its good but a glitch ruined my game
5,2020-11-13 03:03:58,"Ok RubRub there’s something I need to tell u. So yea I’m a mobile player which is pretty awkward since I beat half of God Yeeter but anyways this game has to much TB. First of all, I know this cuz I also play Minecraft but after I got GD I didn’t play it much so Whalen I went back to Minecraft after several months it was pretty laggy and my iPad was practically burning. So I’m pretty worried that GD night tap into other important applications but I know that you won’t do anything about it and you might probably might not read this but yea;-;  -FlakeGD",Ok this my 3rd review
5,2020-10-03 19:28:44,I have loved this game for many months but there are a couple of bad parts of the experience first off when you go into the level editor and your trying to find the breakable block it doesn’t not fit in with the platforms at all next up demon keys are impossible to get and the chests are hard to keep track of.  Lastly can secret coins be easier to get? I mean I  have unlocked clubsteb but only clubstep I support you guys but please fix these problems,Idea
3,2020-07-11 14:34:57,"I love this game. It has been my favorite mobile game ever since I got it, and I would be more than happy to rate it five stars. But, there has been a glitch that has affected me so much that the game is almost unplayable! Whenever I download a custom song, it skips the entire downloading process, and the song doesn’t play when I enter the level. This also happens with previously downloaded songs as well. I tried to email RobTop about it, but they haven’t replied yet. I hope they have a major bug fix in 2.2 because this glitch is so annoying.",Would be five stars except...
4,2020-01-04 00:45:23,I still love this game but oh my GOD it needs a new update to fix issues with tap delay. I was trying to beat a demon earlier and in about 40-50% of the runs I had an input not go through at all or happen so late for no reason that I literally couldn’t go through it consistently. This issue is making the game almost unplayable in most levels it occurs in. Ik 2.2 has been on hiatus for years now but can we have at least like a 2.1.2 to fix this issue on mobile bc this is freaking ridiculous.,This version of the game is breaking horribly on some levels.
5,2020-02-11 03:00:43,"THIS GAME IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY!  Honestly I've been playing this game for 5 years and my opinion on it has never changed, this game is epic. 2.2 is indeed coming don't worry, I believe we'll have it by Fall this year, 2020. In this game, PRACTICE IS KEY! Your going to rage and that's alright, take a break and come back later. The reason why RobTop hasn't updated the game is because he's caught in a loop of ""create something, find a bug in it, fix it repeat"". Last, Don't worry Rob said that he's almost done with his final preview for update 2.2. Thank you :)",To all haters
5,2020-01-20 19:28:55,"I started just when 2.0 came out and I was really excited! I beat the levels all the way to x step in about the first week. I couldn’t beat the levels after. I played some more and then, I needed to beat all the demons and electrodynamix. Then, suddenly 2.1 came out! I beat fingerdash the day it came out. Then, after some time, I wait for 2.2... This isn’t a rant about how long it’s taking. Robtop works alone. I recently got extremely good beating 4 demons a day. And I’ve beat all of robtops levels now. Great game, robtop!","Great game, Awesome levels!"
4,2018-02-20 02:37:30,"This is a very fun and challenging game, and I love making levels. However, my biggest problem is the fact that I cannot do anything with my account. I have logged in to my account on one device, but it will not let me save/load data. On another device, whenever I try to log into my account, it says “login failed”. I can’t upload levels. I also cannot open daily chests on one of my devices. This is very frustrating because I would like to be able to work on levels on multiple devices. Please fix this!",Fun game; account issues
5,2019-11-18 22:48:14,"This is the only game that I have downloaded on my iPhone X so far, and it will be treasured forever. This is totally worth the money with the online levels being totally decorated with effects, and it’s just the place to go if you need a chance to relax from the regular levels. Even though some of the levels *like bloodlust* are INSANELY HARD, it will keep you playing and playing. Don’t go skim through the comments like, “oh, another laggy game that takes up space” because trust me, this will be worth your while. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!",BEST. GAME. EVER.
5,2019-06-13 17:44:37,"This game has so much potential! Although you Rage on levels, you can master then overtime. From easy to demons. You can create your own levels with an abundance of variety! Unironically play others. This game has so much variety put into it! Amazing! Love it or hate it, it is the almighty GD! It is EXTREMELY addictive that will get you glued for not a whole day, not a whole week or a month, but even years! Although updates can take the longest out of any other game, in the end the whole wait is worth it! Amazing potential, with a few suggestions.  Bugs I have experienced at least a couple of them. For example, the handstand bug, when the spider walks on its head on a platform above it in mini size.  I can’t really go on with this list because so many people have experienced these, so, hope they get fixed.  Best game. 5 Stars",One of the best pay to download games
5,2019-05-31 21:59:52,"Personally, I love Geometry Dash, by far one of my favorites, but there is one thing, it’s been over a year since an update, and I feel they need to add either a new world to Geometry Dash World, Another game entirely, or a HUGE update on the full/lite version. This is a great game, and still has potential. But one of these ideas would be great to see in the near future. But, I am still putting 5 stars because I have played this game since my early days when it came out and I still do today. Bye",Love this! But there is some flaws.
4,2017-11-16 23:06:55,"I love this game to death, but I still have 2 problems. 1 is that I needed to log back in and had to change my password because I forgot it. But now I can't view a single persons account which irritates me because I have to search up the level of a creator instead of going to their account. And 2, lag has gotten worse, whenever I go into a object heavy level it crashes on my iPad mini which is very irritating I get that it will lag but crashing is unacceptable. I really hope you fix Rob! I don't wanna quit this game soon from a bug!","Great game I love it, but one more bug"
5,2023-07-27 22:12:58,"I rated this five stars just so it would get seen. Normally i love geometry dash, it’s one of the best games I know of. But I’m having one issue with it, that may just be my device. I’ve tried multiple things, yet it still won't open on my device. I get the ""robtop"" loading screen and then it kicks me out. I'm incredibly confused, and it might be an issue with the game or my device. This game is compatible with my device, but it won't open.",Great Game but I have one issue
5,2023-02-08 02:17:57,Geometry Dash is a amazing game to play on your iPad but for nearly a year now I cannot access it on my iPad which really frustrates me and makes me sad I have gone to steam and played it there but I am just hoping Rob Topsys this and fixes the iPad glitch whenever I try to go into Geometry Dash immediately crashes and kicks me out I do not know if it’s because my iPad is getting old or if it’s because my storage is too full or it’s the app I don’t know but I rob top please fix it,iPad glitch

3,2022-01-23 16:26:20,"The game is fine, but it has a few bugs. 1. When you exit the game and go back in the game the sound cuts. 2. If you have a newer iPhone, and you swipe on the right of the screen to view the control center while playing the game, then exit it, then the sound will keep playing, but the game will freeze for a second, then it will continue, which creates a delay. The way to fix issue number 1 is to close the app, and to fix issue number 2, you have to die in the game, or you can close the app. So please, fix these issues!","Fix these bugs, please!"
4,2020-12-29 19:20:02,"This is a great game, loved Geometry Dash for several years now, but a couple minor problems. First, if I don’t remove the window, and I get off the game to do something, there’s no sound even though I have sound turned on. Second, there’s a problem with practice mode that makes it hard to work with some levels. Take Jumper for example, sometimes if I make a mistake by accidentally jumping, it will keep doing that, making me have to restart in practice mode, which defeats the purpose.

5,2021-11-20 03:31:34,So you know when geometry dash isn’t working when you update something. Well that exactly what happened to me. A few weeks ago I was playing geometry dash and it was AWSOME! But When I logged off to update my ipad the next time I logged onto geometry dash it wasn’t working and it would crash every time I open it so I hope you can please fix this but it’s happening to a lot of people when they update there devices.,Something is definitely wrong…

And it worked fine… Fine until yesterday when I tried to play it and it crashed immediately after clicking on the app. It happened every time I click on the app. So the app is just unplayable now. So I hope they can fix it. Because I paid for this app. The least they can do is make sure the app is playable. I’m currently on an iPhone 8 Plus. I don’t know if anyone else is having this same problem or if it’s just me. But please fix it. I would have given the game a 5/5 but instead a 1/5 now because I can’t even play.

I really want to know if 2.2 will ever come out, or if you don’t care about the game anymore. 2.2 was promised over a year ago, and Im very sad that its not been released yet.

2,2018-04-28 18:40:16,"The only reason I would rate it a 2 out of 5 is because Robtop lacks consistency and when 2.11 came out as a bug fix. It honestly made it worse. I cant even play back on track without the game lagging. Every attempt on every level I play it has one lag and it cause the gamemodes to feel heavier like the wave and the ship. I feel like Robtop mainly focuses on pc players instead of mobile. Robtop needs to focus more on everything. And yes I do know that he’s the only one creating the game. But coming up with a date for an update and not having releasing it is kind of stupid. Im currently playing Cataclysm and I can’t get anywhere past 20% because everytime i reach the wave, I get lag",None

How to make good syncing levels (Help) Once in the creator All you need to do is go to settings (cog by the pause button in the corner) and press 'new' then press create lines in the left corner.   3. No sound bug (Fix) Save your progress in the profile menu, Then delete the app and reinstall, then login and press load. It should be fixed.  4.

Also I have a orb idea. Purple orb, reverses you and can have a second function. Any function of the other orbs. That’s is I hope you add 2.2 really soon :) :)  Edit 1.

At that point I wanted the FULL VERSION but it was 2 dollars and honestly i Don’t mind paying but I had like ZERO money so I waited til I got older and got some cash and when I got my new phone I got GEOMETRY DASH. I love all the abilities/mechanics you can become. I LOVE THEM ALL. (except upside down rocket ship LOL) I am ready for 2.2 because i love UPDATES and any small or HUGE update is a update.

There are not words sufficient to describe how amazing of a creation this is, and I am proud to say it has become a significant part of my life.",The best game to ever exist.
5,2019-07-12 16:38:15,"Sometimes when i want to leave geometry dash, i cant. I keep spamming the home button. Nothing works. Powering off my ipad doesn't work either. Turning it off also doesn't work. I even use the notifications that upper that still didn't work. I tried using siri, siri want able to open other apps and games in my ipad. I was just stuck in geometry dash. I had one thing left to do, wait until my batteries died. I was lucky i had %10. That worked. Fix now or bad luk 5ever",Bug effects ipad
5,2019-01-12 00:25:15,Now I gotta say this app is AMAZING! it is so fun to build play friend it’s so fun. I have some cool ideas for upcoming updates.... 2.2: new triggers such as gravity you can revers blocks this can be super useful. Portals/game mode: 1:up and down portal this portal switches the screen up and down depending on which portals you choose. 2:paper airplane and wind. You use wind to blow the paper airplane. 3: dust fire water. If you are on mobile tap top to go down and tap the bottom to go up. PC: 2 secondary buttons. That’s all I have so keep up the good work rob Top!,Really good
5,2017-01-22 23:51:36,"I've been playing this game since 1.8, and I'll admit it has never failed to give me a blast. There's tons of challenges and fun to be had even in just the RobTop levels, and beyond that, there there are practically infinite levels made by community members. I've only had two problems, one an account issue, and the other a system glitch at the beginning of 2.1 that didn't give me daily stuff, both of those issues I fixed easily. Amazing game! I suggest it to anyone who wants a challenge!",Amazing
5,2023-11-04 06:44:19,Okay so obviously this is a great game but theres a bad glitch going on where people cant join in. Any ios with the circle home button is not compatible with Geometry dash right now. In 2.2 it will be fixed if not then your only choice is to buy a brand new ipad or phone without circle home button  which isnt good so just be patient guys let it go and wait.,Read if you want to know when the glitch that kicks you out is gonna get patched.
5,2023-10-15 23:24:58,"Geometry Dash is the only game other than Chess that I have on my phone. I’ve been playing it since I was 7 and it is the best game ever! I don’t know why but it does not work if your phone is on IOS 17. Whenever I click on the app, it freezes then kicks me out of the app. Geometry Dash Lite has some issues as well.  Overall, great game but been waiting 5 years for 2.2! Hope it gets fixed soon, wanting to play Fingerdash!",Great game but not compatible with IOS 17
5,2023-09-27 20:13:04,I love the game it’s really fun but you need to fix a very annoying bug where it doesn’t jump when you click. Another thing is that when you download the iOS 17 update on your iPhone you can’t play it until the next version comes out. So RubRub should release the next version (witch everyone has been begin for) or make where people who downloaded the iOS 17 update can play again,Love it but could fix some bugs
5,2023-02-04 13:10:57,"So I’ve played this game on a tablet before, and it’s very fun. But now I have an iPad, and every time I try to open the app all’s that happens is it says RobTop and then it kicks me out… I really wanted to play it, BUT I CANT! So that’s 2 dollars down the drain. It’s basically just free money. But I still love the game it’s like one of my favorite games but I can’t even play it anymore. So RobTop if your seeing this, I don’t know if you can fix it or if it’s just my IPad. But if it is you, PLS FIX IT!",Bye bye 2 dollars
5,2022-05-28 11:29:26,"Now let me be honest. This game is hella fun. It’s great. But for heaven’s sake Rob, PLEASE FIX THE IOS BUG! Look. I don’t know what challenges you may face, and I certainly don’t know if there IS a way to fix the bug, but please, if you find that way, make a bunch of angry people not so angry anymore! Ever since iOS 15 it doesn’t work. So please, please, please and one more please, try to fix your app the next chance you get. Because look around you.

At first I thought I had turned it off by accident, I pressed the home button… no response, I pressed the power button… no response, I charged it… it lit up for 1 second but then It turned off. I never got the device back. I got a new one and downloaded it again… the same thing happened. Then a new one and downloaded it again and at least it didn’t turn off but the game just crashes as soon as I open it. this is a warning not to waste your time on this game and then lose all of your progress and your device.",This game destroyed 2 devices and the third one crashes

This is awesome, just I can’t really beat much unless I’m on practice mode so I just- get the music on there we go slow it down 😎 it’s just a bit too hard, and 2.2 should come out soon. Please, don’t push 2.2 more than after 2021. This is amazing, but just get to work more and make 2.2! I love it, but it’s too hard for me. I need more practice-but I only do practice mode, anyways.

4,2019-01-06 18:40:42,"This game has a few pros and cons to it.  There are official levels that were made by the developer. You can buy icons from various shops to customize your cubes, waves, ships, balls, robots, and spiders. There are also millions of user-made levels, some of which are extremely amazing, and some of which are meaningless piles of garbage. There are updates that have been taking longer and longer as the games been going along. This brings me to my first complaint, updates take way too long. Despite this small con, this game is amazing.",Please Read Before Downloading!

5,2019-06-21 15:04:42,I have been playing this game for about a year now and I love it. My only recommendation is that if RobTop could add more levels and make it not allowed for copyable levels that you have to earn like deadlocked and clubstep because when you get it it won’t be as exiting as normal and just please add a bit mor gauntlets and make them pretty easy because I get stuck on the third level of every gauntlet and I can’t beat so I hope RobTop does this. And thank you RobTop for taking the time to read this!,Amazing Game
5,2019-05-31 02:51:22,"I love this game but here is something that way better,  The other games (Meltdown, and Subzero) I love to play as well but it’s kinda irritating to have to go to a whole different app to play “Press Start” then want to play “Airborn Robots” and swap to “Electroman Adventures”. So if you could combine the three then that would REALLY make me happy ——————————————————————— NOTE: This is minor but the red sub color on the first color page is weird because it says     “Rate the stars of an online level to unlock this color” but I CANT FIND THE BUTTON",Pls do this!!!!!

First is the updates, we have been waiting for SOOOOOO long and we still havent have 2.2 come out! Why cant you just like, hire more people to work for RobTop Games! If we’ve been waiting this long, just hurry up. And also, why did you release SubZero... SubZero is just a preview, but why waste your time on a app that should’ve been used for 2.2! I swear, we would get 2.2 by December! And also, if you’ve been working on 2.2 for that long, how come your not done? common sense...","Great game,but.."

I’m iOS 15 and I can’t update my iOS for some reason. So can you make the game open on iOS 15 and 17 once 2.2 gets released? That would be so great! Also, I have the full version on my pc and that’s why I know this game is legendary. Good job Rob! Keep up the good work!",There’s an error on iOS 15 and iOS 17
5,2023-06-03 22:19:11,It’s fun but levels like Time Machine are hard because the song are not like the title also once you complete all the free levels and finger dash and the others there is basically almost impossible to get orbs unless the chest and online level but if you want to play but you have no internet you can’t play the online level so I think you should add a way to get orbs.

Free Teleport orb, (orange) place this orb and the next one you place will teleport you to that position. Tap on it like the other orbs!  4. New levels, on colon’s channel it says firebird will be in the game and rubrub says it won’t. And also please add explorers.  5. Custom objects inf capacity, please make infinite capacity for custom objects.  6. More minigames, adding minigames like the oval of death would be cool, and add a minigames tab witch is a M. Where developer made minigames will pop up.  7. Multiplayer mode, play with up to 10 players online! This mode chooses random levels by users for players to play!                                          That’s about it!",2.2 Ideas!

Unfortunately my 8 year old came across a user created level called artA that was straight up pornography and will be reported so the creator can be dealt with. This game is great and builds response time and mental reflexes. Unfortunately this game has exposed my child to inappropriate content unsuitable for any child...without warning or age verification prompt before opening the level.

The main levels are great and there are a lot of great online levels. I have just one suggestion though, could you make the thicker trails like the rainbow and fire trail bigger? They kind of peek out of the corner of some ships so you can see the part of the trail that should be behind the ship and it doesn’t look good. It would look a lot better if that was fixed, but other than that and some bugs the game is great. Keep up the good work!",Great
5,2020-06-17 17:28:28,"This game is incredible. I loved to play geometry dash lite when I was younger, but I never considered getting the actual one. I thought the only thing new to the real one was that you can make your own levels and there’s more skins. But now that I have it, there’s a lot more than that. Not only are there a ton of new features, it is also ad-free, which I thought was amazing, because there were so many ads in the lite version. This game is definitely worth the $2.","Great game, worth every penny"
5,2020-02-19 13:50:26,"Hey there RubRub, today I’m wondering when 2.2 for Geometry Dash will come out. Now I might sound stupid when I say this, but I don’t play Geometry Dash anymore, but other people do and 2.2 hasn’t come out in about over 1 or 2 years. Please just release an update for Geometry Dash 2.2 please. Your probably thinking I am stupid right now (because I don’t play this game anymore) but I don’t care. If you just release an update for 2.2 we will all be happy. Thank you and have a nice day. (:",Will update 2.2 ever come out?
5,2019-05-22 01:59:52,this is the best game i’ve ever played. the community is big and there are lots of fun levels and you get to make your own levels. also i like the gauntlet levels some of them are very fun. this is a great and i recommend it to everyone that is reading this. it is just a great game. But: Robtop has not released version 2.2 yet and it’s taking him forever. I can’t wait till 2.2. But even though updates take long. It doesn’t matter! Because it’s still the best game in the world. :),this is amazing
5,2019-02-18 19:49:59,"I love this game! It’s addicting and fun, as it says in the title! But, there’s an issue with the replay option... it doesn’t work! Due to the application it uses for replay is shutdown, since October 1st 2018! I was planning on saving my replay to my device, and editing me playing all the levels. But, now I can’t.  Good thing IOS has a built in screen recorder, just, please fix the replay. It’s easier that of using my built in screen recorder, and having to turn it off myself.","ADDICTING AND FUN, but one problem..."
5,2018-06-24 06:10:03,"I love Geometry Dash. I remember how hard the first level was when I first played it, and now I can beat Fingerdash with my eyes closed. I have poured many hours into this game on Steam ant it's currently my favorite game on mobile. The level editor makes it easy to make nice looking levels quickly and gives you nearly unlimited content. And how synced the levels are to the music is incredible. Such a simple game, but it has so much to offer the player. Play this game. It's well worth the money.",Review
4,2021-11-11 03:24:00,Robtop this is a great game and I love to play it offline it was well worth the money to buy but after I downloaded the iOS 15.1 my game will not boot up it will show me the loading screen for a split second then cut out I have tried to delete the game and reinstall it but the same thing keeps happening could you please fix it so I can play the game again it is the main thing I play on a long trip and I would very happy if you could fix it thank you for reading this review,Pls fix
3,2023-09-25 04:40:09,i bought this game months ago and it was working great. I loved it. I stopped playing but kept the app installed and when i tried to play it yesterday it wouldn’t open. It only shows the opening logo and then it closes and wont even let me go to the main menu. I tried getting a refund but the app purchase is too old. I also tried restarting my ipad and the opening logo screen was on for longer and I thought I fixed the problem but it shut off after a few seconds. Help me please.,good at beginning but wont work
5,2023-09-18 10:34:14,the game is a legend it's the best but after years of playing i encountered a glitch and i could not enter geometry dash. every time i click on the app it shows a split second of the loading screen then kicks me out please help me out i don't wanna lose all my progress and i've tried everything except factory reset my phone since im saving that as a last resort,Great game but after years of progress my geometry dash won't open
5,2023-08-12 02:12:23,"I know that probably nobody will see this, since nobody reads reviews before purchasing games anymore, but I just thought I should mention that anyone prone to seizures should avoid this game. There are certain levels in map packs and such that could cause harm. I think that a clear seizure warning should be in clear view upon entry of the game. But overall, GD is probably my favorite game of all time- it’s great :)  Stay safe y’all ❤️",Epilepsy but great game
5,2023-08-02 13:11:05,"So I started a few months ago on geometry dash lite and I loved it so then I got subzero, then meltdown then I bought the full version, I love this game so much it is so fun I can’t stop playing it! Robtop, you have out done yourselves in so many ways. I really hope you come out with more I will enjoy every single one you make they are so good! Also thanks to my friend showing me this game, I would not have played it until he showed me! Super awesome job robtop!",The best
5,2023-05-27 18:57:09,"If you don’t already have Geometry Dash then you are missing out. This game is challenging and fun at the same time. It requires lots of skill to beat the harder levels in this game, but there are also easy levels to fit in you skill range. I started playing 3-4 years ago, and I’ve loved it. The community is also very supportive and kind to newer players. Again, if you don’t have this game, I suggest you get it. You will not regret it.",Very Enjoyable Game.
5,2023-01-17 16:47:52,"It’s overall frustrating to wait more than  5 years and what i think is that is. Just gunna take more years,     It’s just hard to play this game when you can’t wait anymore and if you started in 2.11 when you. Hear about it is just gunna be harder when you hear. About 2.2 they might just played anyways but if it takes 6,7 years i understand how it would take longer",2.2 why just why
5,2023-01-17 14:03:30,"Yes, you read the title right. GD actually has a single problem. So, basically, I’m playing GD but I get bored, so ai go play some other game, but when I attempt to re-enter GD, it just kicks me out after a breif second of loading. You might wanna fix this in 2.2, or maybe 2.1.2, if possible.  By the way, Rob, I’ve used methods I’ve seen practially everywhere, and let me tell you now, they didn’t work for me.

5,2021-03-01 04:59:59,"My main problem right now is in the level editor. When I use Start Positions, the playtest in the editor and playing the level normaly become out of sync (I think it might be lag, but I’m not sure), making it hard to make synced game play. Since I am currently making a level it is making it tremendeously difficult to sync the level, and have it play well. Still a great game though!",Absoluty love this game! But there is a large bug in the editor.
5,2020-10-12 01:47:39,I been obsessed with this game since I got it it’s so much fun and when I do rage I feels so much better when you beat it that’s how I felt when I played clutter funk I love the shops keep up the good work I’ve play the free version so much but now that I have the fullllll version I feel like I’m in heaven this game automatically gets a five star it’s so good also I wonder if you could add a plants vs zombies icon and ship I think peashooter for the ship and a zombie for icon,My favorite game of all time even more then fortnite
5,2020-07-31 13:35:51,"So overall this is a great game, I do recommend downloading it, just one problem, it won’t let me post my levels that I created, at first I though maybe it’s my phone or internet or something, but my friend can’t post her levels either, and she has a totally different house, the same thing happened with my other friend to. I do definitely love this game I would just love if you could fix that! Thx 💕 estegirl",Maybe my internet?

5,2019-11-19 06:12:30,i’ve played a lot of games but when i came to GD was when there was only 3 levels ( still waiting on 2.2 :( ) but other then that this game is incredible from the graphics to the main levels to online from auto to demon this game has honestly changed the way i look at games now. this game should honestly get on the top 2 paid games because Robtop has an outstanding game that millions of people play.

I don’t know if this is a bug or something in the programming, but the icons don’t jump if the pressure of your tap is very high. It’s annoying to deal with fast-paced levels when there are taps that don’t respond when they should. I hope that you are able to fix this soon.

You’re currently unable to play Geometry Dash on any Apple device before the iPhone X/XR. This has been believed to be fixed by the 2.2 update, although it has been 4 years since the last update and chances seem smaller than they were.

It’s annoying because on levels I went increasingly far in, it always makes me jump so I die and have to redo the level. Other than that, this game’s great. Would’ve definitely given it 5 stars if it weren’t for that.",Bug
5,2020-03-30 06:33:46,This is game just blows my mind and just looking at it from all these years it doesn’t even have dust it really good this game should be one of the best game out there also 2.2 is gonna be a amazing also the developer robtop is really nice to the game this is what a game should be like I know it’s based off of the impossible game but this just has a twist also I have been playing this in 1.0 yeah and this game has never gave up and I am just like wow. This game has to be a editor choice......,Wow just wow.
5,2020-03-29 16:18:15,"Alright this game is amazing for its price, people think it’s a waste of money and even rate it one star because one of the levels are to hard, The game is hard yes but if you put time into practicing you get better and better at the game. You can also build your own levels which is my favorite part about this game, building levels in this isn’t hard at all the only difficult thing about building is decoration and figuring out how triggers work.",Amazing game
5,2019-10-31 05:24:11,"First I found this game on videos people would make, then I wanted to try it out. The levels are very detailed and the creativity of online levels gets the game even better. I love the challenge of the game and it honestly gets better every update. The hate isn’t even real. This is to be a must-have on your Phone. Geometry Dash is a great and fun, addictive, and overall so good! I would rate this game more then 5 star’s honestly. Thank you for creating a one-of-a-kind game, RobTop. :)",Literally the BEST game!
5,2019-10-19 01:41:14,"Geometry has been my game to go to while I’m chillin on my couch at Saturday night watching college football. I have been playing geometry since I was 8, I am now 12 so I have beaten all of the levels for a while now and now working on the online ones. I didn’t really have to convince my mom to get this game because all of my friends have it so we know what it’s all about. So, what I’m trying to say here is that it’s a awesome game and I recommend it thank you for reading.👱🏻‍♂️",Why you should get
5,2017-11-22 01:58:57,"This game is my favorite game of all time! Building levels is cool, beating demon levels are so satisfying, and most of the music I've heard are FANTASTIC! What's not to love? Well... Some levels in the gauntlets like the crystal and doom gauntlets have a high object count Whenever I try to load a high object level, The game ends up crashing. This happens on an IPad mini and it is NONSTOP! Just, WHY? That means I can't finish the doom gauntlet. This has to be fixed. If not, then I might as well drop the 5 stars down to a 1 star 😤",AMAZING GAME! But just 1 problem...
5,2017-01-20 04:24:58,"Over a year has past desperately hoping 2.1 would be in our grasps. The sneak peeks, and apps you've given quite ""brainwashed"" us not to be focused on ""When's 2.1? When is the release date?"". I felt that was really kappa and smart of you, RubRub. Now, it's here with it's amazing surprises (Well, some of them because, of the two apps you've given us...) that blows us out of our socks! You've really outdone yourself this time! For a moment, I thought to myself, ""Is RobTop trolling us on this update and sending the update to 2018?"" but, you know, I misunderstood you. The one thing that kinda blows is the bugs you left with the update. I'll name a few: • Can't Open Gauntlets • Can't check profiles (Even my own...) • I've lost tons of data on the update. • Searching Levels has a bit of bugs to name. • etc.",Worth The Long Wait...!
2,2017-06-16 23:38:45,"I've been playing for a while and unlocked the level deadlocked,(and this bug happens in all levels) where I tap on the blue dot near the floor it always adds an extra jump that kills me. The game logics make no sense trying to complete the levels in the gauntlets at this point seem impossible know that this one part I can't get past no matter how long I wait or how early I tap I can't get past that one stupid part. Then the color fixtures on any level make it almost impossible to see. Sometimes I die not know how and can't see anything at all. Even by changing colors of the character don't do anything.",Makes no sense
4,2023-08-18 04:54:30,PLEASE. Please fix the microstuttering. This should not be happening as it worked fine on anything below. The stuttering is unnoticeable for a while until they add up so much that the music is several seconds off and it totally ruins the levels (obviously considering it’s  a rhythm game.)  it also just has lag spikes for no reason. I also have this issue sometimes on the steam version which makes no sense because like I said it worked fine before.,Microstuttering on IPhone 14
4,2023-04-15 06:10:12,"Geometry dash is an amazing game, but there is one flaw. Whenever I build my own level on my iPhone , I try to upload it, but it doesn’t work. It only works whenever I play it on the steam version on my computer. That’s the only reason I gave it a 4 star. Hope this gets fixed soon, RopTob. By the way, whose excited for 2.2 to be released? Because I am! I can’t wait for it to be released! I’ve played others people levels where they recreated the sneak peaks. I’m very excited!",My rating

I don’t know why this is happening, but I haven’t been able to play the game ONCE, and I have to keep playing the Lite version. But, I love the Lite version, and I bet the full version is amazing as well. So, it would be AMAZING if you fixed the glitch, thanks!",GLITCH!
5,2023-03-15 16:27:36,honestly this game is really great and hard for me at the same time but when i had the lite version i wanted to get the full version so i did and realized that this game is so amazing when u can make levels search for other levels which u couldn’t do in the free version so i really like this game thank you developers for help make this game you did a great job and i hope to see more updates soon,Geometry Dash

It says compatible on this iPhone so it’s no a problem if comparability. I don’t know what it is, but it seems like I payed money to play a game that doesn’t seem to be playable.

5,2022-11-26 21:43:58,I love the game and all but when I try to get in the original geometry dash it just crashes before I get to the Home Screen.

And keep trying hard people believe in this game. Thank you!,Please fix this bug
5,2022-10-11 22:52:10,It’s a beloved game of mine and it has been for years. But for the past year I have been unable to open GD. I have watched over 15 tutorials and all of them can’t help me. PLZ FIX. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it probably just deleted all my data. PLUS I couldn’t figure out how to make an account so all my data over the years is gone. But at this point I don’t care I just want my game to work,Unable to open
5,2022-07-27 20:01:53,I have played and known the game for a bit since 2014. It‘s been my favorite and a few days ago I decided to play the game again. I bought it but everytime I try to open the game it just crashes and kicks me out. I found out what it was ok the internet and it was cause of iOS 15. I‘m disappointed about this and was really hyped to play it again but I can‘t sadly. Please update your game so I can play again!!!!,Awesome game but…
4,2021-06-26 03:43:49,"I love this home a lot I play it almost every day but I want some things fixed. First off the map packs. When my little brother wants to play this game, he wants to do the alfa and the beginners pack but can’t complete them even though he beat stereo madness and back on track. So please make them a little easier. Also I wish I could transfer data to the other geometry dash games like the the icons and colors. So that’s all I want I hope it is not too much.

5,2022-03-27 16:00:24,"The game is great!  And the music goes really well with the levels in the game.  When you are stuck on a level it can be really frustrating tho and it makes you rage a ton!  The feeling of frustration makes it so much more special to complete a level you have been on for so long!  I recommend this game to you.  You have to pay for it, so if you don’t know what game to buy, I recommend this one.","Great game, but rage endusing"

I updated my phone to iOS 15 yesterday and the app no longer works.  It crashes immediately upon launch.    Idk if this game still gets any attention at all from RobTop but if it does please fix.

5,2021-08-17 02:14:54,"The game is challenging, and that’s what makes it so much fun. Beating a level after hundreds of attempts gives you such a rush, and it makes the whole thing worth it.

Music is half the game so I can’t still give it 5 stars. For those of you thinking it’s a problem with my phone, the music and sound works in any other app so it must be geo dash please fix robtop!  —3 stars  Also it seems every patch just adds a worse bug.

5,2020-10-20 13:36:35,Geometry dash is a really good game and if you’ve never heard of it you definitely live under a rock. Anyways all I have to say is that there needs to be a easier way to navigate searching for other levels made by others who play this game. I dunno if it’s already been fixed but it’s kinda a problem since it takes so long to introduce a new level into the game. That’s isn’t enough to leave a bad review it’s just an idea. Still a fun game. Peace ✌️,It’s a really good game but...
5,2019-06-29 15:29:59,"I love Geometry Dash! Robert, you’ve made awesome levels with great music selections (my fave is Geometrical Dominator.) But I feel like it could use some new things: 1. A new “Frog” mode. It is constantly jumping but you can tap to pull it to the ground, and hold to keep it on the ground. 2. A new shopkeeper named ‘Gristle’ who will trade skins back into the corresponding shop it came from for orbs and maybe diamonds. Gristle’s shop could be on the other side of the settings screen, bythe normal Vault. 3. The Stone of Space-Time, that you can trade with Gristle for Spooky’s and Glubfub’s coins. 4. A new vault called ‘The Closet of Infinity’ with a legendary demon inside who thinks he is RubRub. It could be unlocked by owning the Stone of Space-time, and could be in the treasure room by the chests requiring 5 keys. That’s all! I’m excited for 2.2!!! -TheIrishPotato67",Amazing!

That’s why now that I get the game again I am so incredibly upset with how bad this was.  There are no new standard levels. The online levels are just terrible. The decoration on online levels take away from any gameplay, and the ones that don’t do that are just boring. I’ve been trying for two hours and I am bored out of my mind and extremely frustrated that I can’t even find one decent online level.  Please bring this game back to life.

It does re-spawn you in the place you died, except sometimes you can never get out of the spot. I was trying to get one of the coins and died between two spikes.

4,2023-07-03 06:44:18,Im telling this to everyone the difference between pc and mobile is crazy my best on mobile deadlocked is like 35% and on pc its 100% pc is just so much better in every way so if you plan on getting this game then get it from steam if you have a pc and in deadlocked for the mini ball when you go through the teleport portal and go through the upright portal i think it was on mobile and mobile ONLY you can get a bug where the upright portal doesnt work so you just die,Difference
5,2023-10-05 21:30:45,"I am so exited for the 2.2 update this month it’s official!! One bad thing is that I updated my phone to iOS 17 it would crash the game, I am fully relying on 2.2 for me able to play again. Other than that great game. Love the physics and my favourite game mode is wave mode, One thing I am worrying about is my progress because I didn’t save my data so I will lose all my progress and I almost finished a demon but I didn’t save great game!",Good game!
5,2023-09-30 13:39:17,"So for the longest time it works like normal, but whenever I exit the app, the music won’t play. I got used to it and just planned around texting and calling while I play. But now the game won’t even open. Because it’s still I good game and it’s probably my phone, I still gave it 5 stars. But my phone came out in 2021. So it shouldn’t just crash every time, right?

4,2022-08-03 22:05:14,"This game has been broken to where you can’t play it on iPhone, the game crashes upon trying to start the game. This glitch came to all gd spinoffs, and yet they were all fixed in recent updates. Can you please just update the game so we can use it? It doesn’t even have to be 2.2. It could just be a small bug fix update. I don't care as long as the update fixes the crashing issue. Please just update the game in some way so we could play it again.",PLEASE UPDATE
5,2023-03-12 02:15:28,"Ok, I’m not lying to you. This is so much fun. When you see what it looks like it’s a square jumping over spikes, but it’s way funner than u think! But one thing, in practice mode, sometimes you respawn jumping, and you hit a spike. And you respawn again, and you hit the spike. And it goes over and over. I’d just like that glitch to be patched, although it’s really fun, and you should get this app.              -geometry dash player","No adds, and extremely fun!"

The creative music is perfectly synchronised with the jumps, and the wide difficulty range helped me start and expand my skills in the game with ease. However, the game suddenly stopped working, and whenever I try to play, the game kicks me out. I tried to uninstall it and put it back twice, but the glitch stayed. Please fix this soon!

4,2022-02-12 20:44:05,"Ok so, thgis game is rather enjoyable and i play it a lot. There is one super huge problem that practically ruins the game. Its so bad Ive uninstalled this game multiple times because of it. The issue is the lack of updates. ong when 2.2 coming cuz fr its getting boring in here and I need some content to keep myself cool. when 2.2 this sh taking so long im gon be dead when it drops. ong so many trailers and sub-games when they can update it and make double profit. fr hate it when developers lazy and money hungry.",Good Game 1 problem
5,2022-04-10 13:25:17,"Doesn't have annoying advertisements , and it doesn’t have in app purchases that are required to actually pay the game , granted there are in app purchases, but only for character customization and stuff like that. The only other thing you pay for is the game it’s self. Game play is fun, I could go for days playing this game. Though I will admit, it can get frustrating. But that comes with most games.",Good game
4,2020-04-13 00:36:26,"I thought this would be boring and easy, well no. It’s actually a game worth my time and it’s not a FNAF game which are usually the only games I play. I would like stuff in the game like transparent blocks and stuff like randomize level which takes blocks and makes a possible easy level just like super Mario maker 2. Thanks for making this game because I like it. The reason it’s a 4 star is because I found this game really hard to make levels in and it’s just really hard on the second level. Thanks.",Actually fun
5,2020-06-09 17:15:33,"I got a few ideas for geometry dash. In the comment section you should add icons to see what people actually play on, for example if someone is playing on mobile it shows the mobile icon. Next is Dragon. The dragon is similar to the ship but instead you burn Blocks in your ways. It’s portal color will be Teal. Last is bosses, in custom levels there is bosses. But some of them look the same instead of hand drawned. So in the levels you guys make should have bosses.",Idea
5,2020-04-16 12:24:01,"Ok, this is by far my favorite game, I play mainly on pc but there’s no difference on mobile except that it’s like 40 hrz. The official levels are amazing and perfectly balanced, although everybody is upset that you get more stars for clutterfunk that Tartarus😂. I’ve spent so much time playing it on pc that I’ve beaten windy landscape 18 times, and bb once. The community is amazing, and there’s endless content in the game so you NEVER get bored, and overall, this game is perfection. Just one complaint. WHERE TF IS 2.2! ROB WE NEED IT. But good game.",GOOD GAME
4,2018-03-27 23:37:47,I highly enjoy this game it is very challenging and fun. I recommend this game for all ages. I believe if you try you can do it so try these levels and you can do it but not on the first try. Please play this and leave good reviews. I hope you enjoy this game. I think you can do this so just try at least one time and you might get it and love it. I love this and I know a lot of other people do to so play it. If you enjoy this game you are not a quitter. I recommend this for anyone who is up for a challenge.                             -Monkey Bryn,Great Game
5,2019-11-27 21:38:06,"If you see this comment, I really want to let you know that I don’t like this game... I LOVE it! Soundtracks are good, levels are fun, and so are customizing your character! But a couple suggestions for 2.2 - 2-5 more levels, More characters you can get, another shop, and more creator options. Such as- More triggers, more block designs, and Particle editor. Ratings - Pacific Demon  Silent demon and there NEEDS to be different star rating for the types of demons. Pacific-10  Easy-13 Medium-15   Hard-17  Exreme-20  Silent-30",2.2 😩

I like the new features, chests, The new shop, and I love it RobTop! Really cool and nice game,and this one was the best GD game I saw yet. Two things. Can you refresh the leaderboard because I want Carrotmaster out of my way and I’m always behind him. The other is........ WHERE IS 2.2? I’ve been waiting for it to come and........ITS NOT COMING IN EARLY MAY! So where is 2.2? When are you going to refresh the leaderboard? Let me know",LOVE IT! :D
4,2023-09-30 13:36:15,"This is a must read before you download the game. Geometry dash is a fun game with simple tap to jump controls. That does not mean that it is an easy game by any means! It takes time and practice to become a professional. But it makes an excellent game for car rides, or when you have a small five minute break. Overall it is one of the top games to download and I highly recommend it. But keep in mind that simple does not in any way translate to easy.","Simple, not Easy"
5,2023-10-10 17:59:14,"So, when I try to open the app, it brings me out of it as soon as possible. It may be a account problem, but my guess is it is having trouble loading.

5,2023-10-05 00:35:29,Ever since i updated to iOS 17 it stopped working. I haven’t been able to play for a week so i looked at the reviews and it seems like this is happening to a lot of other people. Please fix this robtob I’m going to die without geometry dash. But anyways i love the game and can’t wait for 2.2 to come out. Very excited! Just hope that the glitch will get fixed before it comes out. Fingers crossed!,It won’t work

Ever since this has been happening, I have been becoming more and more hopeful that it would work, but to no avail. It is honestly making me a bit sad. I paid money for a game that I loved to play, that I can’t anymore. It’s making me pretty angry and sad. This is SUCH A GOOD FRIKIN GAME, if only it would load. Rob Top, I love your game, and I hope you love happy 😊.",Is this Apple’s doing?
3,2022-08-16 16:14:26,This game is one of my favorite games of all times but ever since the new update it hasn’t been letting me play. It would kick me out the second I try to join the app. The other versions are fine but I  paid for the full version and I would like to play the full version. Please fix this I had a lot of progress and I wanna get back to it. This is why I’m giving it 3 stars otherwise I would give it 5 stars for sure. I don’t know how the new update is because it won’t let me play.,I love this game I just have some issues
4,2019-11-07 00:11:10,"I used to enjoy the game but I haven’t improved at it since so I decided to play other games. I would definitely play again if there was an update once in a while. How long has it been since the last update, a year and a half? I would rate it a full 5 stars but I’m getting bored of playing user-created levels. I like the way RobTop (I’m not sure if he still goes by that) makes levels and haven’t seen anything by him since Fingerdash.",I’m gonna make this simple because I’m a very simple person.
2,2022-02-20 21:56:24,I got this game and I can’t even get into it. When I open it I see the RobTop screen and in like 1-3 seconds it kicks me out. I watch YouTubers play it and it looks really fun it’s just I can’t really open it. If the next update fixes this 2 stars are going up to 5 stars but now I’m staying at 2 stars. If it would be to hard to update it to fix it maybe they can make a geometry dash dedicated to IOS 5 generation and lower. BUT WAIT don’t go saying it’s a bad game (unless you have a IOS 5 generation or lower) it looks really fun but I just can’t get into it  Please Fix.,"They need to make a IOS 5 generation version,"

5,2020-08-04 04:32:00,"Hey Robtop! I have an idea for the next update. I think you should make it so you can still earn orbs and diamonds even after you have already completed the level. This is because if you are like me, and you play this game a lot, then you know that it is very hard for you to find some new levels when you have played so many of them. Other than that, i think the game is perfect. And please add alot more icons(especially cubes). Awesome game!",Update idea!
5,2020-06-24 18:24:49,Hey rob i love this game! I found it randomly in the App Store back in 2.0 but it was lite and I quit cause it was to hard (I was 6 yrs old at the time) then I saw in again in 2018 and I bought it and I quit 1 year after and I recently came back 3 months ago (I have two accounts) account 1: gdnoob7. Account 2: GMDBlackyDude. Thanks for leading me with the game for 3 1/2 years! I rated it five stars because FORTNITE IS DIEING!

I absolutely love this game, but it’s been 2 years since the last update. It’s been taking so long for 2.2 that it makes me wonder if RobTop has just given up on the new update or if they are planning something huge that will completely change the game. I really hope that the update is released soon.","Super fun game, just please update it"
4,2019-07-09 12:35:44,This is a great game I play A lot either with my friends or just by myself but one thing Kind of agitates me it’s that there’s only certain amount of levels in the never like adding new ones or making new content and it says hey get full version to get more stuff I click on the get full version edit just brings me to the page of the game in the App Store so if someone else knows how to get full version just please let me know thank you.                                                                       -SkullCrusher9520,Love it but.....

Halfway I was already mad! From all the dying,dying and dying, also all of us are wondering when is 2.2 coming? RobTop can you give us a release date,I don't know if he actually gave a date so, if you haven't please do.

This makes me really sad as I can’t play this great, addicting, and extremely entertaining game on my iPad. I don’t think that this is much of a difficult fix, but I know absolutely nothing about bug fixing. Thank you so much robtop and I really hope you take this review into consideration",Amazing but one problem that is very disappointing
5,2018-07-22 23:27:00,All I wanted to say is EPIC game and that I like no in app purchases or adds makes it more fun no adds saying remove adds bye buying this and so just fun game but one problem. I need more levels I beat them all even the demon ones and I want more and online levels I beat like all of them most levels I find online say competed already so I just want others to make more levels or robtop to make more thanks for reading. Have a nice day👍😻,Amazing but needs more levels
5,2023-10-22 15:47:54,I love this game so so much but I did not realize when you download iOS 17 it does not work and I’ve played this for years and now i am super sad RobTop is the goat but I just miss the game so much I’ve had such a long journey and now I feel like it is all down the drain please just please fix this I love this game and WE all want you to accept that I just want you to RobTop I am not blaming any of this on you.,When will it come back
5,2022-12-16 06:43:29,"Geometry dash has always been my favorite game but a major issue was that with the new update, I couldn’t even play the game because every time I opened the app; it would close instantly.

5,2021-12-22 18:44:16,"Yep, this app is my childhood… I played it so much. It’s so simple but amazing. Most of the levels at this point aren’t really impossible, but the difficulty settings make it to where you never really beat the game, you can always set new goals and get better. Amazingly fun game, doesn’t get old because there are so many user-created levels. You have masterfully designed this, RubRub, now when 2.2???",Still Amazing
5,2021-10-11 15:17:58,This Game is so much fun 21 different levels to play and online levels as difficulties go up the more of a challenge you’re in for this game is the best what do I have to say but could you maybe switch Time Machine with Theory of Everything Time Machine should be insane because ToE is a lot easier but if you don’t want to and are fine with how it is Idc but this game is just straight up awesome!

5,2020-06-26 23:15:17,"I Think it would be a good idea to add geometry dash on console, since there already are controls available on a controller. It would probably attract a lot more people from console. I dont really think the editor can be on Xbox tbh though. But this decision can attract more players, still. The full experience though will likely stay on PC, because you probably need Xbox live to play online, but you might be able to make a acount. (But not be able to interact online)",RobTop
4,2020-03-19 23:52:46,"This game is awesome, but some of the levels I think should gave more orbs, like chambers only has 75 but I think it should have at least 100.

5,2021-08-12 15:00:43,So I’ve played many mobile games and sence they have in game money there are always in app purchases but this game no. Another reason I like this game is because of the sound track they are always stuck my head ( not that’s bad or anything ) but one thing that would make it better is if the other tracks from the other games where in the maker mode. Like press start or the seven seas,Nice

The music uses NewGrounds  Pros -  👍best music 👍Creating levels 👍Playing online levels 👍Offline game 👍The best addicting game 👍etc.  Cons- 👎Blocks awesome songs (so we can’t abuse them) 👎Bugs in main levels (not online levels) 👎etc.",We like GD but...
5,2018-07-24 18:00:41,"Out of all the games out there, geometry dash is one of the only games that has kept me playing games on my phone. There is tons of things to do. Literally millions of user created levels to play. The game is challenging, but watching yourself improve is incredible. And beating a “demon” level feels so satisfying when you finish it. I highly recommended this for anyone who wants a challenging platformer that can literally last forever.",A true mobile masterpiece.
4,2023-06-15 21:32:00,"Enjoyed this game since I was pretty young, though returning to it now there’s so many issues with music delay that not even the offset settings do anything about it (or rather it doesn’t let me change the input time by less than -1000 milliseconds, cause some of these songs have been delayed by at least a second after all the age that this game has shown. Is it good? Yes. Does it need fixing? Absolutely.",Great game! But its age is also a downside in an unexpected way…
5,2018-06-10 04:25:33,I love all the awesome soundtracks but when you play it to much my brain get fuzzy and I get a grey because I can’t beat this stupid level! Love how I can color my character and make my own levels.  Love the challenge though I recommend that you take a break and only play this when you are irritated. It just makes it worse. Sometimes this game glitches and won’t let you jump but you know what not every game is perfect! Over all.... great game.,GOOD but.....
5,2023-07-06 20:55:03,"Overall this game is really good and I have got every single version like meltdown, world, subzero, lite and this game itself. But, I feel like Time Machine should be an insane level. It seems weird that I beat 2 insane levels after playing for 2 weeks but I still have trouble on Time Machine. I think it should be an insane so maybe in 2.0 Robtop Can change it.",Great game just should change some things
4,2022-10-07 22:02:24,"So recently I’ve been trying to open geometry dash to play since it’s been awhile since I’ve played it. I clicked the app and it kicked me out. Clicked it again, kicked me out. I offloaded it and reloaded it and still nothing. I turned off my phone, deleted and reinstalled the app, and tried opening it from the App Store, but still no luck. Other than this huge issue, I enjoyed this game very much and still recommend.","Great, but won’t open anymore"
5,2023-03-09 22:37:10,I haven't played a game this fun since jetpack joyride this game is awesome you can make your own levels play online levels and even play main levels and there are quests and challenges so I very much recommend this game for anyone that is at all bored or waiting for a new fun game (though this came out in like 2014) it's a really fun game and I strongly encourage anyone to play it.,This game is amazing and I would love to see 2.2
4,2018-12-15 16:00:14,"Don’t get me wrong. This is one of my favorite games on the App Store. But it CAN mess up sometimes. For example, viewing the levels online doesn’t work 75% of the time. Also, sometimes the editor creates rectangles that won’t let you do anything until you play test it. You should also be able to spectate people at the leaderboard to help you on that level, and to expose hackers quicker. Other than that, this game is wonderful, and you should definitely play it.","Pretty good, but has its flaws."
5,2022-07-10 15:32:14,"I have been playing this game for a few years now, though strangely, my device had started to not load up the game. I would click on the app to play, though for some reason, it instantly kicks me out of the game. I’m not really sure if this issue is with any now-incompatible devices for the game, or with any game errors, but if this could get fixed it’d be really nice.","Great game, one major issue"
5,2022-06-19 05:15:18,"Whenever I sit down and I have nothing to do, I pick up my phone and play geometry dash. It is so addictive, I can find myself playing for hours and never get bored. Everybody says that it closes the app anytime you get iOS 15.5 but I have no glitches. I play geometry dash competitively and even though I’m on mobile it still has the same quality as a laptop. 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",Best game to play when you’re bored.
5,2022-03-19 23:05:52,Geometry dash is a amazing game but there is a bug that is quite annoying me. When ever I load into the games it always kicks me out automatically and does not give me the chance to play the game so I can’t really enjoy the game it self because I cant really play so if you see this can you please fix this because I want to play this game and enjoy other peoples levels. Thank you robtob for this game,Glitch
3,2022-01-20 21:26:50,"Ok so I loved geometry dash Lite so I bought Geometry dash. At first it was so much fun but then, every time I tried to open the app it kicks me out at the RobTop screen. So I deleted and redownloaded it and it still kicked me out. So I just installed a glitch fixing update to my iPad and yet it still kick me out! It says when swipe down “compatible for this device” but it isn’t compatible! Please make an update that will fix that?!!!! I love the game but I can’t play it when I could I thought it was the best game ever. I Also I paid for it!",The Glitch!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,2021-12-08 07:23:29,"After updating my iPhone 8 to 15.1 I have not been able to open the app. I am not sure what is going on but even before the update there were bugs with the gameplay (the wave gamemode bug). This game is so good and I put a lot of time into it, it’s sad to see that I cannot do that anymore, yet. Hopefully this will be fixed soon so the geometry dash community can grow even more.",Amazing game but can’t play
5,2021-05-09 03:21:52,"Honest opinion? I love this game. People give the game bad reviews for dumb reasons, like “It’s too hard!”, or “The coins are impossible to get!”. The challenge is the thrill, people! The thing is, beating a  level such as “Clubstep” or “Electrodynamix” or even community levels such as “Platinum Adventure”, just makes you feel accomplished and proud of yourself, and the editor is just a delight to use, once you’re used to it. Overall, great game.",Good Game!
5,2021-03-07 12:12:52,It’s impossible to create an account on mobileI’m l’ve tried this one billion times and it still does not work ☹️So I cannot create anything if I create a level it just stays where I created it and it won’t let me put it online Next thing you know robtop tells me oh It was because we don’t want people hack you sryI did not mean it But seriously I still can’t create an account and I cannot create a level and just put it online,No account no create
5,2020-09-15 19:04:06,"Geometry dash is one of my top favorite games to play because it’s so awesome and there are so many things you can do. You can create levels, customize your character and find many secrets that give you in game rewards. A things I like about geometry dash is that you don’t need internet to play so you can just play on the go at anytime at anywhere. Geometry dash deserves 5 stars in my opinion :)",A fun experience
5,2020-04-30 14:45:16,"I love your game and I have been playing it sense and long time ago, but I have one minor thing it ask. Can you please nerf cycles? Don’t get me wrong, I love this game. But don’t you feel like cycles is a bit to hard to be rated a harder level? I mean, lots of triple spikes in tight spaces. Not to mention the ship part at 60 percent.  Idk maybe it’s just me having trouble with it. But maybe consider nerfing it so it’s only a little easier. Ok bye it’s the end of the review.",Please read this
5,2019-04-30 21:52:07,I really like this game but it’s has some bad things like that some levels are awesome and they are not rated and other levels that are terrible made and still get rated and I got banned from leaderboards and I never hack this game so please fix that and also how long are going to take to make an update like 2.2 because I’m getting bored from this game so please add new orbs and new stuff and please add please don’t be inactive but still this game is good?,This game is good but not the best
5,2019-01-26 15:36:18,"Geometry dash is a really fun game! I recommend it to players who are looking for a good challenge! Geometry dash is a game where you are a cube/square, and you avoid spikes, and jump on blocks! You can even make and play online levels! There is a verity of fun and difficult levels for you to overcome! (And also this game is extremely difficult to people who try to do it for the first time. People get better over time, so be patient and have fun)",This is amazing!
5,2018-07-02 00:07:01,"This game is great and all, but I really need RobTop to read this. I’ve been trying to make an account for ages, but it says that my email is taken or invalid. I know it’s correct because I have only one email. If it is taken, someone has actually accessed my private email and my inbox info. If that’s true, I need you to find that account and DELETE IT!! I don’t know who did it, but that person could be accessing other private info. Please! Help!",Great game but..
5,2017-10-08 21:03:37,"This game is just great. It is almost perfect. The only problem is there is a bug and robtop won't fix it. I'm not sure if anybody else has this problem, but custom songs don't work. I can download them but I can't hear them. So It kinda ruined the whole game experience for me. So robtop if you are reading this, please fix your game * side note I play this on computer and mobile and my account is linked on both. And it started after 2.1 was realesed",GD
5,2023-10-19 00:57:29,"Hi, I’ve been playing geometry dash for a while now, and I’ve been experiencing some issues with the app. First of all, when I try and open it up it just takes me back to the home page, I think this happened when I updated to IOS 17 Maybe you might see this, I don’t know. Also please try and update faster, the GD fans are getting aggravated, if you fix those two, five stars.",Bugged.
4,2022-07-02 06:48:20,"I have very little problems with gd but there is one thing that I (and like the whole player base) want NOW is 2.2, I understand why it has taken so long and I hope that you can go back to smaller updates soon. Also in future updates I would like to see some more dj Nate songs, specifically toe 3 and electrodynamics 2 because they are my favorite songs! And I can’t access the original  songs because they are not on newgrounds!",🎵 Geometry dash 🎵
5,2023-08-08 14:23:26,You can build your own level and you can play all the levels plus some different levels online and then you can make your own account. You can create a level and then you can put it online and it goes on and on and don’t really think that there’s an end well I think it is but it’ll take a looooooonnnggg time before you beet it so that’s it.,I love this game it’s the best
5,2023-04-01 01:45:35,"I have played for so long. I used to only play geometry dash lite when I was 5-6 but when I was about 11-12 I started playing again on lite then got the real game. And ever since I have played for so long and now I’m 13 and making and playing amazing levels. It’s worth the $2 for endless gameplay in your pocket.

3,2023-03-18 05:42:15,"Due to 2.2 still not releasing over 5 years, On newer devices, the game doesn’t even fit the screen! The lite version does! The update takes too long that Geometry Dash may be dead. RobTop may go bankrupt in the future since the update is taking too long and people prefer to buy the lite version due to it being more modern and it fits the screen! Also, I heard Geometry Dash is being removed from stores due to the update taking too long.","Lite Version fits modern screens, but not the full version"
4,2022-03-23 21:55:01,"This game is awesome, played it since summer of 2020, but I just re downloaded this game this week and I am so glad the iOS 15 update doesn’t crash this game immediately after opening up since this was a problem on my IPad. So I think you have to get this game after updating to iOS 15 in order for it to work only on IPhone I think. Great game! The only issues are 1. When I exit out, the sound isn’t there and 2. 2.2 isn’t out yet! So 4 0ut of 5 stars",Awesome game
5,2022-06-05 04:45:46,I really like this game very fun and all but recently there’s this glitch that keep kicking me out of the game I try downloading it again and again but it still kick me out of the game. I downloaded the full version and I spent two dollars on it and geometry dash world and subzero also doesn’t work the only thing that work is melt down even geometry dash lite doesn’t work so plz fix the glitch pls,Some glitch
5,2022-04-19 23:50:16,I have been playing for the first day it came the first update of the entire game it was a awesome journey I loved the game but when I heard about 2.2 I was so excited a swingcopter! I wanted it to come fast but I know you devs are trying to be able to make it good and I respect it :] I loved the journey and thanks but I wasn’t to good so that’s why it’s said I have in the 100ths star’s so my name if you can always notifie me my name is WORRIORTIGER,Hi um when is 2.2 coming

5,2020-07-24 13:35:48,I love this game even though it has its ups and downs like with some bugs and everything mostly just operates fine it’s just that U have to update the leaderboard rob. Also I’m having trouble with creating my level why u ask? It’s because the song in editing keeps glitching for me. I’m not hearing the same sync at each part compared to editing then when I’m in testing or playing it. Please fix it. Ty,5/5 Awesome Game Overall (Please Read This Rob)
5,2018-05-10 20:02:20,"Honestly, this game is FANTASTIC! There are very few glitches, and this game has A LOT of creative freedom. My only complaint is about the updates. 2.11 was released in NOVEMBER last year, and it’s been 6 months since the last update. I understand why they take so long, especially since there’s only RobTop working on this game. But surely you could add less than you do each update, and consistently update it every 2-3 months.   In the end, fantastic game.",Wow...
5,2017-11-13 01:53:32,"This game is extremely addictive, and the big community that it has makes this game even better. The satisfaction of beating a level that you’ve been trading for months is amazing, the huge variety of levels make this level fun from begging to end, and the level editor has helped people make levels that are out of this world.

Talking about being lazy and begging for 2.2 to come out right now, and some saying the game is too hard to it’s bad. But don’t listen. After all, you are 1 sole creator.

It takes an enormous amount of time to go from one update to another. Even though ppl might say that it takes time to develop games, it shouldn’t take months to possibly even a year. Either way I’m still hooked, and you should take advantage of ppl who are still hooked too. Or you might begin to lose players.",Waiting

5,2021-08-28 23:47:52,This game is a 10/10 it can be incredibly challenging at times and i’m not complaining i love a good challenge. It’s a really good way to pass the time for example it took me two hours to complete the 4th level. It does have some bugs for example when i make a character it never saves it so i cant use a different skin. But other then that good game. Would play again.,6/5

Idk why but It just does. And I gave This a five star only because the other reviews say that It’s really good and I believe in them. I hope yours did not have this glitch/bug cuz Its the worst glitch/bug EVER.,THERE’S A BUG/GLITCH(when I first started
4,2022-12-19 13:06:32,OK so like every time so like like every year it happens like twice a year but like every time I go in at least once in a year my daily chests even the ones that like both daily chests they both like for the brown one it says it says 11 days in the other blue want it says it takes 12 days like what I would rate of five sorry if I didn’t have this but I’m reading a four-star just takes a fun story because the rest of the game so GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDD,Glitch with daily chests
4,2021-09-12 19:46:42,I have ben playing this game for a long time and it’s really great! But there’s some downgrades. First of all this game hasent ben updated in 4 years! Witch is insane! If your willing to play this game and the next update to come out tomorrow then don’t play this game because they will probably not update in the next couple of Months. But overall it’s a really fun game! If your expecting it to be fun then I would! Recommend this game! And that’s why I’m giving this a 4 star review so uh by.,This is a great game!
3,2022-07-14 17:12:55,"I have been playing Geometry Dash on and off for the past few years, but recently my app has been glitching out. Every time I try and open Geometry Dash it instantly closes and goes back to the home screen. I’ve deleted the app and downloaded again, but with no success. I tried other versions of the game, but for some reason they also didn’t work. All my other apps work perfectly fine, so I’m wondering if there is a simple fix to this issue. Overall great game though.",Great game but…
5,2021-10-03 02:18:54,"At first I had the demo and whenever I got the actual game it was sooo much better. This is a super fun game, but I think there needs to be the levels from Subzero and Meltdown. That would be better instead of having three apps. I also think the level creator needs to be simpler, and a make your own cube mode you unlock at 800 diamonds. Plz keep making the game better and better. Thanks for the game!",Best game ever
4,2018-07-12 17:35:39,"Geometry Dash is a 10/10 game to me.  It has a lot of very cool things like the songs (Deadlocked, Club Step and XStep), I also like the gauntlets.  My only problem with the game is the wait for updates.  2.2 still hasn't come out in over a year and a half compared to 2.1 coming out on January 17/18th 2017 and 2.2 with no set release date as of July 12th 2018.  Overall Geometry Dash is a awesome video game on mobile devices and Steam, but the wait for updates is getting longer and longer and that is a bad thing for the game.",Great Game!
3,2021-03-31 18:15:56,"Updates, a game should be updated at least one a month or once every 3 months at the least. But going on 4 years, it’s a little to much. This coming 2.2 update better have a lot of new things for it to be 4 years in the making. The game is fine overall but when the same songs, and the same play style with the same decorations being used, it’s all starting to deteriorate the play style. The game has super cool features already but once again we’ve waited 4 years for some more. It’s time to update",Updates
5,2021-03-27 04:23:33,"This game is amazing you can literally make anything and do anything in this crazy 2D video game. The creators and community are amazing funny and sweet and are so supportive, the game is so fun. The past six years of playing this game I’ve never ever gotten bored it’s amazing and I’m so happy I found this because it really helped me this game is so underrated like it doesn’t get enough attention it deserves and it’s sad",It’s me refo and I wanna say this game is the best game ever.
5,2021-03-21 20:06:35,This game is a really good game. You fly around in jet packs or tap a million times but this game is fantastic! No glitches I see in this game so far except sometimes the music doesn’t load but if you hit the home button twice and swipe up and reload the game the music is their. Game hasn’t been updated in 3 years but this is good. No adds at all yet and you can make fun games and play what other people created. Honestly a good game for 1$,Amazing
5,2021-01-27 21:38:22,"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️I LOVE ITTTTTTTT EVERY GAME I PLAY I GET BORED AND DELETE IT AND NOT THIS ONEEEEEEE WORTH EVERY DOLLAR!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😱super hard tho lol also I’m blown away by the amount of secrets and hidden vaults and stuff like that it’s amazing.

5,2020-10-16 01:41:24,"I’ve been playing this game since the ending of my 4th grade year, I’m a junior in high school now, and this game is still amazing, the community can be toxic at times, but the constant number of new levels being released by the community and the number of things you can do in the editor have kept me here till now, and I can’t wait for 2.2. And yes, that sentence shouldn’t have bad that many commas.",I love this game
5,2020-09-11 15:29:12,"Honestly, GD is one of my favorite games of all time, and honestly I think it deserves more love than it does now. I’m not saying that it doesn’t have that much love, because it has tons, but what I’m trying to say is that I recommend this game to anyone who’s up for a challenge and likes a good laugh there and there. And RobTop, if your reading this, I have one question -   2.2 when?",Super amazing and sometimes hilarious
5,2020-04-24 05:18:02,"Best phone game there is. So fun and there’s a community behind it and not a cringey one but a community with structure and respect. Been playing since 1.8 and saw the rise of many legends. Riot, Cyclic, Giron David, Andromeda, Zobros, Dorami and fast forward to newer legends like Knobbelboy, Trusta, Technical49, npesta, zylenox etc. these are just a few off the top of my head, but there are many legendary people and this game. You can be the next legend. Get this game, KEEP GEOMETRY DASH ALIVE",Will forever be the best mobile game
5,2019-12-31 03:38:07,"I was practicing duelo maestro, turned my phone off got back on, played a little more practice, but when I went back into normal mode, the second icon was completely gone. There was still a trail and all the particles, but the icon was nowhere to be seen. Not a big issue but still felt like I should address it.  Note: the icon reappeared after I exited the level and went back in, so it's not a game breaking issue.",Big in 2p mode
5,2019-12-13 23:12:55,"I enjoy the experience I got from playing this game as a past time but overall it’s really addictive and I enjoy the sound, colors, and especially overall the music but lately their has been trouble like can’t recover data and can’t even open the daily chest and even can’t really enter the daily level or get silver coins using my unlimited data and even connected with the WiFi. Plz help!!",Best game worth the dollar
5,2019-04-20 14:25:07,I’ve read a review about this game it said that their where inappropriate levels but I’ve played this game for more than three years and the only bad thing I have seen on this game is bad thing about trump for the election other than that there have been no bad things on this game. All of the levels are great for on the road trips and the best thing is that it does not have to have WiFi. And it will keep your kid entertained. 👍,Recommend
4,2018-02-05 00:03:21,"This is an amazing game. It has unique graphics and game mechanics. I love the game to death. But here’s why I gave it 3 stars. It does not register tapping easily. I die half of the time because the game will not register my taps. None of the other apps I have share this issue, so it’s not a problem with the way my device is programmed. It’s just the game I use that requires tapping the most. I don’t know why this happens, but it doesn’t seem that other players have the same issue, so I’m really confused.",Doesn’t process tapping
5,2018-06-02 18:16:08,"If someone asked me what my favorite game is I would choose GeometryDash. This game is so fun yet, its one of the most popular games to cause rage!!😀 What’s fun about it, is that you have three options of awesome play, one to go and complete every level, Stereo Madness to Fingerdash. the second is to complete the story in the game, and third is complete, or make online levels. Each way is fun and addictive. I know for a fact that I will continue to buy from RobTop.",Super cool and addicting!!😀
5,2018-03-19 02:39:42,Hi my name is Erick your game is so awesome I am 9 years old and play on a iPad I am making a new map called onyx summit by pizzaeater9 be sure to check it out I’m planning to release on April 15 so don’t forget to check it out I’m trying to get the 50 likes icon and the 100 like icon and I’m trying to get a star rated so be sure to rate it. For 2.2 i am wondering what will be new and I can’t wait to check it out. Your game is super fun and super addicting.,Best game ever and so addicting

I only have one problem with it which is when I go to make an account, I make my name and password, but when I put in my email and click “confirm” it keeps saying “email is invalid” over and over and over and over. I re-typed it in multiple times and I didn’t work. Pls fix this.   -hav0C",Awesome. But....
5,2017-11-14 22:45:03,This game is AMAZING. I have been playing for 2-3 years and I love it. I have completed 37 demons and have about 1600 stars and it’s one of the greatest games to me but I just don’t like the fact about how long it takes for the new updates to come out. I understand like 9 months but I really stress full waiting for an update to happen for a game and then it comes out almost a year after the teaser comes out.,Amazing game but slow on updates
5,2023-10-11 15:54:58,I payed to be able to play this game and now it doesn't work you try to open it and it closes immediately this is the only app I’ve seen do it and all the reviews I’ve seen a mentioned it and I just want it fixed please Robert Topella I bet he is busy working on 2.2 but please fix the crashing bug we payed to play this game and that is a rip off if I doesn't work,iOS 17 bug
4,2023-01-30 23:14:24,"Ideas for 2.2😏! Ok so maybe you can change the level order around? The levels should go like this: (starting from base after base) jumper,  then can’t let go, then xstep then Time Machine then cycles (which should be an insane) then blast processing then theory of everything then electron adventures thenclub step everything else after that is good nextmaybe make a new difficulty between insane and harder like insanely hard thanks for your timebye rub rub",None
5,2023-06-26 13:17:00,"The game is an one button click game styled like the impossible game. The main level the game presents you are good at teaching player how the games mechanics work, and how they play. Hitting an icon that has a hammer tool on it brings you to community levels. You can use an in-game build level creator to build you own creations. The game is worth the five dollars and i highly recommend it.",Amazing gameplay
5,2023-06-21 11:16:19,This is one of the best games ever but about 2 yrs ago I started and loved it I beat the first level and then collected a star on back on track but it didn’t show the star and I was online so please fix this also sometimes when I have other apps open the music just stops and I really like the music so can you fix this too thank you,Amazing game but two things

3,2020-08-19 00:02:04,I love the game it’s awesome! I do have a tiny problem thoughI published a map  and I rated how hard it should be. This is where the problem is I made my map about 2-3 weeks ago and it still is not rated! If it’s rating is nothing/ N/A Your map will most likely not be seen and there’s one more problem it’s super hard making an account. And you need an account to publish a map and getting on a leaderboard. I know nobody really plays it these days ( the game isn’t popular anymore) but I hope these problems get fixed. Anyways that’s my review!,Custom games
4,2020-07-19 19:05:59,"Geometry dash is awesomely and addicting but there is a few things that is wrong Bugs: When you put about 8000 objects close it exits the level. It had made me lose a few levels cuz of this. There is some bugs in the editor in some levels like berserk or piggy back the 2 player duel mode and the platform in berserk cause insane bugs incapable with play testing . On mobile it says login failed and Register failed I try to sign up. 2.2: WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 3 YEARS FOR 2.2!!!!   Anyways, this game has filled up my time. And it is a good choice to download this game even it cost money but it is a awesome choice worth the bugs and stuff   P.s do not add in app purchase we are fine.  #Seven X  And also why do you ban actually good songs like viscerally and realfaction and more ):",Awesome game!

5,2019-04-07 11:49:54,I love Geometry Dash and all of the levels!!! It is one of my favorite games I play. I first started playing this game in 2017 when I saw my best friend playing it on his phone and I thought it looked pretty fun. I started off by playing Geometry Dash Meltdown and Geometry Dash Lite. I then bought Geometry Dash because I was really wanting to play all the levels instead of the first 11 levels. Geometry Dash is an awesomely amazing game and I am probably gonna play it for a long time!,Awesome Game!!!
5,2022-10-17 13:07:05,"The game is amazing(the lite version since it’s the only one I can play) I bought the full version just to figure out that the app can’t even open.

I was wondering if i could find out whats wrong or how to fix the problem?,😡
5,2022-02-08 00:58:19,I know that this game will not open and it is sad (especially for dedicated players like me) but it will be fixed soon don’t worry… But this game is getting TONS and TTOONNSS of bad reviews because of it… this game does not deserve this (cuz it’s one of the best games ever) get it on another device or leave a review about the glitch… but don’t  make it one star…  Also check out “white space” by Xender game (best level evah!),Hear me out
4,2018-11-21 20:15:06,"This game is great. I play it all the time when I get bored. The soundtracks are amazing.  And I haven’t even talked about the custom levels. Where do I start? It is amazing playing other people’s levels with great songs. Not all of them are great but most of them are.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that (since update 2.0) the updates take too long, but 2.2 (as of November 2018) is on its way. RobTop is working hard (at least I hope he is) on the update and it will come out soon",Addicting

I spend hours playing this game, and I always have fun with it. The people who keep asking for 2.2 are just ignoring the absolute masterpiece that is GD. My only problem is that some levels are kind of tricky and broken, like Hexagon Force and The Challenge. Other than that, this game is amazing.",Perfect.
5,2021-02-24 16:47:04,"Hi, Geometry Dash geek here, I have to say that this game is wonderful. I have some ideas.  -Orange Jump orb + Gravity Switch orb. Even though that is technically what the green orb is, you would get more of a jump out of it. -XL portal. This would allow you to grow, unlike the small portal, which shrinks you. The small portal is already in the game. -Shark portal. This would allow you to turn into a shark that could swim in the water block, and you’d be able to jump out of the water, but you die if you leave the water completely. It would have a different movement mechanism than the ship. -More wave skins. -More spider skins.  Those were all of my ideas. I think they were cool. I don’t wanna sound like i’m begging, but it would be awesome if these were in the game.","This app is phenomenal, and I have some ideas"

As you play the game will lag and the music won’t line up with jumps, portals, etc. Which can be annoying sometimes. Especially if your playing a level that requires a lot of focus. I don’t know how the game runs on computer but I assume it’s better optimized. The mobile version however isn’t. This game deserves an update!!!",Needs an update!

4,2022-10-16 19:13:55,So I absolutely love the game but whenever I try to play it it just crashes and sends me back to the Home Screen. Whatever this is can you please try to fix it? I have no other problems than I can’t even play it at all. I  tried ré downloading it multiple times but it didn’t work. I tried resetting my IPad but that didn’t work either. So if you can fix this problem please do.,I love this game but there’s a HUGE problem
3,2023-01-18 20:34:23,Right now they don’t have 2.2 in mobile and why? How does every type of geometry dash games have 2.2 but mobile. Also it’s kinda of a rage game because you constantly play and have no check points in the game to not help you and you have to do everything again and again. Another thing is it’s no quadcopter or animation and no new levels and please make 2.2 in mobile and I will rate all games that’s from Robtop 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ but now it’s ⭐️⭐️⭐️ stars.,Why is 2.2 not out for mobile?¿☹️
5,2022-09-16 03:33:38,"Love all, think it’s amazing. Just one small thing. For me the music is very delayed like I played Blast Processing and the music stopped 5 seconds before the actual level ended idk what’s happening and I deleted and re-installed and the problem still persists but it’s not happening to my friends either. Please try to fix this. Also I’m excited for 2.2 I think we all are :)",Amazing!
5,2022-07-31 20:31:41,"I absolutely Love this game overall the game is a solid 5 stars despite this review where I’m complaining about how I can’t play the game I don’t want to hurt the reputation on it tho or make the game look worse because of this bug, I assume it’s temporary, I just want to add awareness to this glitch and I rlly hope you patch it soon Because I’m dying to play again.

5,2022-04-11 00:26:45,I think this game is really fun! But sometimes it can get frustrating. So I reccomend maybe taking some breaks in between games. But over all I reccomend this game. You can get the lite version but it doesnt have all the stuff in the real one I didnt notice untill I got this one and the lite version glitches a lot so I reccomend this one hopefully you like this one and have a good day!,Play it if u like it

So i buy geometry dash on my iphone 8 on ios15 finally after 6 months of me wanting it and now the game doesn’t even work  cuz robtop likes to do things solo for some odd reason so now i have to wait (of course how ironic) for him to fix it while he’s currently making the biggest update yet so now its gonna take even longer for me to play. Do not buy the game if you have ios15 or an old phone..,Im literally gonna cry

5,2021-10-07 22:54:28,"Hello! Today I will be telling you why you should not get IOS 15 if you play geometry dash, and if you use any device made by Apple©️.  So apparently, by September 21st, I got iOS 15 on my  iPad Mini 4. Until October 2nd, I wanted to go into the game but then, my game crashes INSTANTLY, meaning it kicks you out of the game 1 second later. Before when I had iOS 14.6, it did not do that. This means that when you have iOS 15, your game is outdated, and that geometry dash is not usable at iOS 15 or iOS 14.8. So if you are about to get iOS 15 or 14.8, don't. Thank you for reviewing this review. Deleting the game and redownloading it will not fix the issue.

5,2020-08-23 03:38:36,"I have had this game forgot over a year now and I love it. It’s so simple yet so hard at the same time considering it was made by just one guy. The fact that he also added in a level creator is so much fun to mess around with and publish levels publicly. One thing I do suggest is adding in unlock able blocks from beating certain levels or difficulties. But other then that, I just LOVE this game and I highly recommend this.",5/5

There is so so so so many levels and community ones that pop up every day, once you have beaten all the built in levels, you can even make your own and play other levels made by real people, unlike half the other games.

5,2020-05-08 04:00:47,So it’s been a few years since my last review and well... I am just just disappointed in you robtop and I have kinda given up. I just want a response on what happened 2 years ago. So with all that... I just want this bug that doesn’t allow you to upload your levels to be gone. If that thing is fixed I could die happy in the geometry dash aspect. But all that aside this game is great! So simple yet so gosh darn good! so ya 4.5/5,Well...
4,2023-09-25 16:57:02,"I love GD. I’ve been playing since around 2016. And with 2.2 coming in a couple of weeks, i’m more hyped than ever.  There is only one problem i have: the game crashes on iOS versions 15 and 17. Not sure why these two specifically, but it certainly is weird.  The way the game is made and how it runs is perfect. Only in-game issues I have are the rating standards, which are very inconsistent.  Other than this, the game is a 10/10.","Great game, but…"

The levels may be frustrating, but once you get good enough skill from online levels, they’re very fun. Like, I used to think Deadlocked, (the hardest main level) would be impossible for me. Now I’ve beaten all 3 main demons! So yea, overall this is a great and addicting game.",Any Gamer Must-Have
5,2018-10-25 12:54:49,"Geometry Dash was a game I’ve been playing since 2014, and to see how far it has gone is astounding. While the game has reach a pinpoint of difficult when it comes down to user-curated levels, the system in place for it is massive, allowing for levels that you would never even think of existing.

5,2017-09-28 00:23:32,"I don't leave a review on a game unless I thoroughly enjoy it. I have to say, it is worth the money. This platformer is action packed, insanely hard, and loads of fun with hundreds of new levels every day and many unique songs.

I found out you get those from the meltdown and world versions. I downloaded them. Made my own account on the original then TRIED TO SYNC MELTDOWN ON 2.1 BUT IT SAID IT COULDN'T UNTIL 2.1.  I also tried to sync worlds But THE WORLD VESION SHOWED THE ICONS I UNLOCKED AT THE TOP BUT IT STILL HAD THE ICONS LOCKED AT THE BOTTOM.

5,2023-03-17 19:21:57,1. Multiplayer this would be in the main menu it’s where you can play in the same level and race 2. revers blocks this would make you go the opposite direction 3. Explosion key it’s where you pick it up and throw then it makes an explosion this would let you break through walls 4. Defense blocks this would be a block that you can not break.,Ideas for 2.2

Even if it isn’t 2.2 yet, can RubRub please just update the game to fix the issue with mobile gamers.

The developer would fix this but he has his hands full with the next major update so he can not get it working for iOS 15. I use iOS 14 as I was informed. If you already have iOS 15, the game will crash upon opening until update 2.2*. Geometry dash is not a virus if you are nervous, some weird thing happened in iOS 15’s update.

5,2022-06-10 16:31:49,The first suggestion is the quad portal it will put four icons . Control them with quadruple player mode. To control all the same don’t use that game mode. 2nd suggestion. The reverse portal. It will make you go backwards and does not switch the screen around like the mirror portal. 3rd suggestion. The background orb. It will change the background depending on what the creator put it on.,2.2 suggestions

Yes, it’s easy to make simple levels, but the minute you add ANY sort of interesting thing into it and you’re dealing with custom items, animation, custom start positions, straight up movies, and triggers for all of it.

It’s a joke.. how am I supposed to do the harder levels when it’s so inconsistent??? FIX YOUR GAME FOR MOBILE PLEASE!!!! Also, It’s ridiculous that the daily and weekly levels are level 10Insane and also demon levels... I DONT PLAY THIS GAME ENOUGH TO BE THAT GOOD!!! Please tone it down for the casual player who plays for an hour a day.  It’s absurd... or make TWO CATEGORIES, one for the try hard or one for the noob casual player.  Please...

5,2018-05-09 00:24:48,This game is so much fun! You get to listen to music while you play the levels for free and you don’t even have to beat the first level to move onto the second! You can just go to any level you want. Also you can create your own level and add your own music! Another reason you should this game is so much fun is you can play other people’s levels! This is why this game is so much fun.,This game is so much fun
5,2018-03-15 03:58:32,I don’t have much to say because the game is too good. I have noticed that in certain levels my rocket might glitch to the top of the screen causing me to die. The worst thing about it is that it is in the chaos Gauntlet. I can’t finish the level to retrieve the key to unlock the cage in the basement. This shouldn’t be a problem in the future or might not even be a thing for anybody else. I hope this gets patched or fixed.,Best Game Ever
5,2017-04-30 19:04:00,"This game is great. There's so much to do besides just playing through the levels, for example you can build your own levels or play other people's levels too. You can mess around with the Vault Keepers, find the Chamber of Time and just screw around on the home screen by endlessly trying to pop the icons that come through. All in all, this game is amazing.",Greatness of Geometry with Dashes as an added bonus

However, I’ve predicted what 2.2 will be because I play SubZero as well.  -Instant switch -Camera View -Camera lock  However, I have some suggestions before you go ahead and release it:  -New level (preferably 2 new levels) -Character Creator & Submitter (cuz why not) -Please oh oh please change the name of “Demon”  Yeah, that’s pretty much it.

For some reason every single time I open the game it crashes immediately and I just want to say if you can please fix this bug. I love the game it’s so much fun and the fan base is growing very fast (except for the people who are mad that 2.2 is still not out) but anyways that’s all I’m here to say!  Thanks!,Bug
5,2023-10-09 21:37:11,Overall the game is pretty good but the thing is you shouldnt have a default song when you practice levels. You should add the song that came with the level because some levels have sync to the song which makes it easier. Please in the next update fix this issue.  Thanks,Message for creator of game
5,2023-07-19 00:57:47,"Honestly, Geometry Dash is literally, Geometrical, in the best way possible. I can’t believe Robtop would actually be able to make the best game to make me entertained for the past few years.   Since I heard about Update 2.2, it’s been getting to me. “I should play this more!”  I really don’t see any problems with the game so far, I don’t really care about the main levels. I just care about the editor.  The Editor is actually a very good resource of making the best levels in the game. Like Change Of Scene made by Bli.  Robtop made the best objects to make users do their entire best to make some magical levels.  No wonder this game is so popular! Robtop, keep dashing on in the updates!",Geometry Dash Is the best game.
4,2023-06-18 15:22:43,OK so I just got Geometry Dash full version and I waited like 10 minutes for it to download and when I finally download it I clicked on the app and it pulled up Rob top and then I will be to shut down the app I tried resetting my phone I’ve tried hard resetting turning it off and turning it back on deleting the app and reinstalling but nothing works so Geometry Dash please fix this although amazing game!,Amazing but the glitches
4,2023-05-12 21:49:35,I love geometry dash used to play so much and now I’ve come back to play it a couple years later and it doesn’t work every time I go to play it quits me out immediately I paid for this game to have fun but I’m am not able to that if the game does not work for my phone if it’s the version of my phone please tell me if you can fix it please do my phone is a 6s so If it works on this phone please notify me,Help please
4,2023-03-08 02:02:16,"I like Geometry Dash. I like the mechanics, creating your own levels, and I feel like it’s really worth that $1.99 fir this game. But there’s 1 problem. When I edit a level, I test it and fail, and I can no longer move by scrolling, and I can’t build, edit, or delete. I have to save what I’ve done, restart the ENTIRE game, and go back in the level editor. RobTop Games, PLEASE do something about this! Thanks for your time!",one thing…
1,2023-04-08 15:41:06,I wanted to download this game because I have some money and I really love geometry dash but when I click on it it takes me back to home. So I went to app support but it says it is “ UNdER CONSTRUCTiON” so I literally scoured the entire internet for a solution but there was nothing. The only thing I found was that many other people have the same problem and no one found a solution that works and geometry dash is the only app with this issue so I think that robtop did this for money even though he has already four games with ads and he is just too greedy. Worst purchase ever.,SO CONFUSING
4,2022-08-06 23:02:46,"This is a great game an I recommend you buy it. I have been playing it for years and I have had no problems until now. Now when I open it, it crashes. For some reason geometry dash lite works but the doesn’t. It’s very annoying, so please update it so it works on iPhone X. Would rate 5 stars but it’s annoying that robtop has been waiting half the game’s life to update it.",Great game but needs to be updated.
5,2022-09-20 02:52:39,"I love this game, and the app itself runs just fine. However as you may know this game isn't exactly an instant reward loop like a lot of games are; it's all or nothing. That said rven if that deters you, ai'd at least try the demo or ""Lite"" version or whatever it's called. I'll bet you'll fall in frustrated love with it.","Fun, but can be frustrating if you aren't a patient person."
5,2022-08-02 13:47:55,"Geometry dash is such a fun game once you get better at it, but after a while of not playing, the new version came, and along with it, a weird glitch that makes you log out as soon as you get in, i’m wondering if that is just a glitch, or is it permanently? I really hope you can fix it in any way possible. Thank anyway.",Sad Glitch
1,2022-05-03 00:51:30,I have played and really enjoyed the free version of the game but recently it has been crashing and I have watched videos of other peoples games also crashing so it’s not just me. I caved and bought the original game version hoping it would make a difference but  it didn’t. My game is still crashing and I would hate to not be able to play again because I think that this is a great game. I am hoping that this can be fixed soon because although it was only two dollars to buy every penny counts and I would really like to get my moneys worth.,Geometry Dash Crashing
4,2022-03-10 02:36:09,"I played this for a while a long time ago and wanted to play it again. After I downloaded it, I tried to play and it would open the app and then immediately close out. Not sure why, but it also happens with the sub zero version of the game. I’m sure it’s something with my phone and not your app, but if it’s with your app, please fix it if you can. Thank you!","Great game, but I can’t open it"

I uninstalled the game, then reinstalled it several times, and it still doesn’t work. I only get the the screen the says “RobTop” and then immediately crashes. The game is completely inaccessible to me and it really makes me sad and I miss this game. If this could be fixed, I would greatly appreciate it :)",Game doesn’t start
5,2022-03-06 19:31:37,"Hello, I have been playing for 3 years now and I just wanted to say that this game is amazing! There is such a great level editor and millions of cool online levels to play!

It lets me have fun when there’s nothing to do and, yeah and you are the best and, yeah so...I love your game and everything about it. And, I used to just play levels, and now I make levels and The community is so nice and cool and, I just want to say that. Thank you. Thank you for Geometry Dash. Have a Great Day.😊",There’s a bug
5,2021-11-03 03:46:41,I have played this game before it’s a really great game but i deleted it. But i just got it today and i got the one where you have to pay and i can’t play i don’t know if it’s the game or my phone because my friend who is also on ios 15 said he can’t play ever since he updated his phone but other than that it’s a really great game,Great game but i cant play
5,2021-09-06 16:06:07,"People complain constantly about how long it’s taking for 2.2 to come out. Give RobTop some slack. He already made this amazing game, and y’all tell him to do better just because of your personal opinion. Enjoy the game as it is, and 2.2 will eventually come around! Thank you for this amazing game- it’s got great features and the community ties it all together.",Worth the wait
5,2020-10-04 05:29:40,"Thanks for making an amazing game RobTop! My only complaint would be that the game is much better and easier on Steam, due to having potential higher refresh rates.(especially with FPS bypass hack!) however, I think it’s great that you made a mobile version for it so that toxic nine year olds can play to.(P.S: when I jitterclick on PC version, it looks like I’m speedhacking or using auto clicker cuz I click 11-12 CPS.)",This is my favorite game
5,2020-06-14 13:03:51,"Geometry dash is awesome. I have a idea of a new game mode. I call it a star. It floats like a ship, but when you tap, it works like a green orb. Also, can you make another level, maybe it could be space themed, and called orbit swing. Pro’s need more levels( even though I did not beat deadlocked, yet).  Please defeat hackers. One more thing. Spikes need more block designs for the levels. That is all",Gd rocks
5,2020-04-28 21:09:38,"I love this game. I’ve just completed deadlocked and working on ToE2, and I now play in both mobile and pc.  I just want to let you know that 2.2 doesn’t have to be perfect, and it doesn’t have to complete the game in everyone’s eyes. Yes I do want the update, I just don’t want you to give up on us since we won’t give up on you. You’re awesome m8, and I can’t wait to see what games or updates you have next",Hey Robtop
5,2020-03-22 04:49:01,"I love playing this game it gets me pumped when I complete difficult levels. I have one problem, in that I cannot seem to share my own level, I worked pretty hard on it. It’s not the best since it’s my only decent level and it was hard for me to verify it and I want to share it. How can I solve this problem?",Good game. Rage inducing most of the time but I still return to play it!
5,2019-12-25 00:09:33,"This is an amazing game.  Geometry dash came out, as far as I remember around the time of the first iPad. From the first play to my most recent, it's been all play and no glitches, for me at least.  One amazing feature, that was added years ago, is the ability to make levels that others can play, and it's awesome.  I really appreciate the fact that the developer(s) have kept this app compatible with older OS versions because, well it makes it so no matter the device (at least to some extent) you can still play at some 'level'. Then according to word of mouth, the game also has lower resolution mode(s) for older devices-really great thinking, and probably appreciated by many.","Legendary game, & available on iOS 8"
5,2019-07-01 19:31:32,Geometry Dash is a fun but hard game. Geometry Dash has so many different levels to play and explore. Geometry Dash is fun because when you get pass a level you jump with excitement. This game is hard because when you die a lot you rage! Geometry Dash also has this thing called “Level Editor” where you can make your own level and share it with people! Geometry Dash has many secrets to find.,GD Review
5,2019-03-03 15:41:05,"Oh my gosh, this app is amazing! I’ve never experienced glitches, lags, and my device never crashed while playing!!! I love this game!!!!!! The animation is smooth, and I love the unique thing about geometry dash, that the music is on sync to the jumps and levels! I also like how everything is made out of shapes! It’s super cool! And I also love the fact that we can create our own levels! I can’t find anything to rant on geometry dash!",AWESOME
5,2018-12-31 00:23:22,"Love this game! It always brings something new to my eyes, and new challenges and endless possibilities! I love how we can create levels and how inspiring level creators are these days! There is the slow progress on updates, but you can’t really blame him. Amazing game.   All the bad reviews are people raging because they can’t pass back on track or because of the delay between 2.2",Amazing! Been playing since 1.2!
5,2017-04-12 03:26:40,"I know in the community, a lot of people have been talking about how you only rated the levels of those who had a large amount of creator points. But now you have taken it too far and now you are just putting random levels in the hall of fame, which doesn't make sense. Now, expect all of Adiales' levels there (not saying he's a bad creator :) ) but you get what I mean.","RubRub, Stop Featuring Random Levels!"
3,2018-09-17 19:12:32,I’ve been playing for about 3 years now and over the time it has ages really well and bad at the same time. For the good levels are better decorated people are getting better and all together it’s still a solid game. But the bad overweight the good this game gets only one update a year or feels like and the community for the game is just absolutely horrible full of toxicity and 6 year olds don’t even get me started on how hard it is to play this game on mobile now as well,Good game and all but nearly no updates
5,2017-04-11 23:48:41,"I have an awesome idea for a new 2.2 update! It adds a new mode. It's called a glider! The portal would be yellow, It still has the icon but there is a triangle above it. It would also have a new gauntlet, the Air gauntlet. 〰. I called the new level that goes with the new update Clubflub. Just search it in geometry dash, so you can see it. I also came up with a new shop, The demon shop. In the ""Demon Shop"" you can buy the Ultra Key. 🔑. Which is the key to opening up the Dungeon Of Crystals. All the codes are #Shiny, Xtreme, Runis, Stone, Underground, and Gl1©h. You come up with the rest. I really ❤️ playing this game. IT'S SO FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hope the new update comes out soon.

I recommend this for sure and I’m just saying, if you get an allowance or have a job, you must get this app. There are a lot of levels exclusive to this app and millions and millions and millions of levels to search, including demon levels and auto levels. so far fingerdash is my favorite level that is exclusive to this app.",100% worth the two bucks
2,2023-09-26 21:40:35,"I’ve been playing this game since I was in 7th grade and I just graduated college. Throughout that time, I’ve always been playing Geometry Dash. It’s taken me years to get past the hardest levels and unlock the rarest icons. I loved every minute of it. The levels, the music, the features, everything was awesome. Since I recently updated my phone to iOS 17.0, this app no longer opens on my phone. I even deleted the app and redownloaded it and it still doesn’t work. I will miss this game dearly and hope RobTop decides to update it",Good memories
5,2023-08-22 22:51:02,"Well just like any other rage game this is a rage game that makes you rage like “RAAAAUGH“ and I will be completely honest with you all...I really almost threw away my phone because of this game BUT IN A GOOD WAY!!! I would never tell anyone NOT to buy this game but if you DONT wanna play the game then I won't say you have to but in my personal opinion, you should buy it, it's worth all the cents.",THIS GAME CURES DEPRESSION...I-i think.
5,2023-07-19 17:35:45,"So recently, I’ve been putting a game every time I’ve tried to upload a level check someone’s profile and type in chat. It doesn’t work for the profile says faild to load  is says it wont load either or for uploading levels and same thing with the chat Please fix this",Weird glitch
5,2023-03-08 19:49:06,"This is a perfect game. You can save levels for offline use, and it gives you YEARS OF FUN. Not even exaggerating. You can play 20 levels a day and never run out because the community is CONSTANTLY CREATING NEW LEVELS!

5,2022-12-11 01:44:28,I like your guys games and I have played geometry dash lite and enjoyed it. So I decided to get geometry dash which cost money. When it was done downloading I tried playing the game and it kicks me out right when i click it. I keep on trying to play it but it keeps kicking me out. So I want to know if you guys can do anything about it.,I thank I found a bug

Since the lite version works well, I was not anticipating any issues with the full version. But every time the icon is tapped, the game opens to the logo and then quickly closes. I have forced it closed, powered off and on, deleted and reinstalled several times. Sent a request to app support 4 days ago but have not heard back from anyone.

It’s a pretty old phone but I cannot get the app to open, it just shows the blue screen with RobTop and then crashes. If we could get a bugfix for it not opening on older iPhones that would be GREAT! Thanks, -Talon",Please read this RobTop!
5,2022-06-27 22:03:14,"So, I know that its crashing for EVERYONE, but there is a reason for this. so, currently Robtop has 2.2 BETA servers open and because of that he has to update the game while working on 2.2 causing it so that he has to close the game to the public, UNLESS you have access to beta servers. If you wanna play GD (Geometry dash) just install GD world or GD lite and use that until 2.2 comes out",BEFORE WRITING A BAD REVIEW READ THIS!!!
1,2022-06-06 00:09:02,I bought it and I like the game and all but I spent my money and now the game when I open it instantly closes I don’t think it it very appropriate selling an app that does not even work I don’t understand why you would just take my hard earned money like that and not even have a warning like does not work on these devices:ext why would you not put that if you knew and if you did not then why did you not try it on all devices this has by far ruined my geometry dash experience and I’m still thinking about quitting I would like to be refunded,Not working on iPod
4,2018-01-16 21:59:57,"Amazing game, very difficult but it's fun and challenging, you feel so good when you beat a level. There is a problem though, I enter in my email and it says invalid, I'm positive I type it in correctly, I restart my phone, turn off and on wifi, made more space in my phone, even deleted the game and re-downloaded it, nothing works, please fix this.

Every time I click on the app it starts to load the entire screen but then will close automatically. If i click on it again it will just do that same thing. The same thing happens with subzero version of the game and i'm not sure if its cause of the new ios update or what but I tried restarting and even deleting and reinstalling but still no fix. The game is really addictive, and a easy fun way to past time. I hope they fix this.",theres a issues

It used to never crash and I played this for hours and completed many insane demons. I don’t want to lose my progress since I’ve been playing since 2013. This used to be an amazing game. Til it starts crashing. I’ve moved on and sorry to say this, but I’m gonna have to play something else like Roblox.

5,2020-12-05 13:37:51,"I have been playing this game for a year, and it never disappoints. I made my first feature worthy level recently and it got rated.

Highly recommend this game! Thanks RobTop!",Highly recommend this game for kids like me!
5,2020-05-31 18:05:32,"This is an outstanding game! I used to own the lite version, it was pretty limited, you couldn’t do that much stuff and get as much things. It was like this until I got the full version back in 2016, Then I realized how good this game was! You can do so many things. For example, you can play levels, create levels, do quests, open chests, and many, many more!  My only problem for this game is that the updates are slow. But it gives us enough time to get used to the features.  To conclude this review, This game is amazing and you should buy the game or play the lite version if you’re up to the challenge.  Totally worth my money, Five stars.  -Ericnots",Amazing game!
5,2019-04-06 23:05:29,"Hello robtop, ive been playing gd for 4 months and have enjoyed the game alot. But one thing out of everything is buggy.

I just want to ask if you could fix this bug. Thanks. :)",Bug
5,2019-03-26 13:17:37,I have gone for on to beating tons of levels and this game is also very tricky. It can be frustrating sometimes but when you beat the level it feels way better this game also teaches you to be creative and build whatever want in the editors guide this game has endless possibilities with about 500 levels coming out each day I recommend this game so much,This game is awesome
5,2018-06-11 01:06:07,"Wait a second. WHAT!? So basically this is the best arcade game ever. I can’t believe we can make awesome levels. Not because I rate this five, its because you can make awesome levels, get songs, (At least I like dubstep) I downloaded it and it was super fun. All I can say is that you have to play this unlike the ROBLOX app I already have so u have to download it. YOU NEED TO. (That’s rather a opinion)",We need the recommended rater to rate this 5!!

Every little thing is great, except you have no explanation on how to get the keys to unlock stuff, and… most annoyingly, the chests don't work. I go on and the are both dim not giving an amount of time until I can collect. After I BEAT a level, I can open it, but then it says ""Wait… something what wrong,"" It's annoying the bejudles outta' me. Please fix the chest error and get something more for the keys.

But I was good enough to beat all of those. That's when I started to play demon and insane levels. Horizon is the hardest demon to me. The nightmare is the easiest. Buy this for $2.00!

5,2023-03-25 18:13:12,I know that the devs probably won’t see this but the game has absolutely no sound for my ipad pro. That is the only issue im having   I have tried turning the sound on and off plus even uninstall it and reinstall it but with no luck  I have seen this for few mobile games of late that i own and do not know what’s causing it. This also kinda does defeats the purpose of a rhythm game with no sound but don’t get me wrong I absolutely love this game i’ve always had love it. For 6 years this game has been a personal favorite of mine  If a dev does see this and could possibly fix it please do but other than that have an amazing day^^,Love it but just one thing
5,2023-01-08 15:08:39,Hi Robtop or (RubRub) anyways I play gd every single time I have new Ideas for 2.2 let me start with adding a white orb the white orb will make you double jump instead of 1 jump. next is a new vault it will be called “The Darkness” and function like the other vaults including “The vault” “Chamber of time” and “The vault of secrets” If you and your Geometry dash team add this I will be happy,I’m curious of 2.2

The fact that this game has zero ads just makes it that little bit better. I don’t see any problems with this game. I definitely recommend it! 🤩❤️😎",Absolutely amazing
3,2022-10-16 15:34:48,"I’ve played GD lite for a while now but I recently payed 2 bucks for the GD game but it won’t even load. So if you see this please fix this in the next update. There are thousands of people who payed for it and you got the money but they don’t get the game in return so please fix this. I’m exited to play when you do fix this( ps, I watched the how to fix it vids and they don’t work for y’all who are trying them) thanks and I hope to be jumping demons soon.👍👍",Fix this please robtop

5,2022-10-09 15:24:37,"Why have you updated geometry dash meltdown and geometry dash subzero to 2.2 but not geometry dash? If you did updated geometry dash to 2.2, I think you only updated pc players, if you did update geometry dash to 2.2. Please update the mobile version I have been wanting to play 2.2 since I have seen what you have in the update.",Really good but one problem
4,2022-09-28 02:48:09,For some reason I can’t launch geometry dash on my iPhone 8+ and it just kicks me out I’ve been trying to fix this but I just can’t I made sure I had all updates and everything and even restarted my phone twice so if it possible please make it so I can play some more. That’s my only complaint but I just really love this game and want to play it again.,I can’t even play the game I love
4,2022-08-11 17:02:38,"To the developer(s):  I have recently updated my phone to iOS 15…and apparently every time I open the game, it crashes instantly and I’m not sure what this is. Could it be on your end, or mines? Either way, PLEASE fix this! Update your compatibility to maybe iOS 10…who still uses iOS 8? I don’t want to delete this game…I am too far in to even do that.

3,2022-06-03 23:14:27,"The game has recently had a bug maybe this is an IPad glitch or a game glitch because it kept kicking me out of the app. I don’t think this is my IPads fault because I reseted the app, I shutdown my IPad/restarted it and it still didn’t work! I went to extreme lengths even deleting the game and re installing it *4x* deleting all my data, but it didn’t work. This game is great but I’m unable to play I’m sorry to blame this on you if it’s my fault, the games good but I can’t play it.",Glitch
1,2022-07-06 21:39:57,This game can cause people to feel pain and suffering. This game can be very eye damaging because of all the bright colors and the screen moving very fast! If playing this game for more than 30+ minutes you will start to have a headache. I would not recommend this game to ANYONE it has many bugs in the game and is not very developed that great! It will make you very angry instead of making you feel happy. I have had multiple friends half to get glasses and other stuff to help with there eyesight and eye pain. All my friends including me regret playing this game!,Don’t get this game!!
4,2022-04-11 00:15:23,"This game has lots of audio glitches, I reinstalled the game to see if that would fix the audio glitches but it didn’t, and when I logged in and went to load my data from the cloud it just says sync failed every time I try, because of this I can’t load my data and have to start over, please fix this, thanks.",audio and data sync glitches
5,2022-06-01 22:01:04,I love this game. But then one day I went onto the game then it kicked me off. When I tried to get back on it just kept on showing the Home Screen for like a second then it just takes me back to my Home Screen. I’m a mobile player by the way. I hope you can fix this bug soon.,Absolutely Amazing but one thing…
4,2021-05-24 19:37:07,This is a great game but I have a few suggestions... if you can make more demon levels or levels in general that would be good. Also can you move sub zero levels and meltdown levels in the game ? And make some use for the vaults when their codes are all in so that would be good also there is still lots of bugs that you can fix... so I hope this helped  Bye 👋,Great game but some stuff you need
5,2022-01-17 15:45:26,"Everyone's writing reviews about this, but you NEED to fix it, or else everyone who's playing on a phone or iPad will never be able to play. The iOS 15 update.

5,2022-01-15 01:11:20,"So I love geometry dash, and I am progressing with the levels, but there is a glitch. Whenever I exit geometry dash, but don’t close the tab (which I do all the time) the sound is completely gone. it is a small glitch, so I gave 5 stars, but I just wanted it to be acknowledged. Other than that, this game is great, and I have no other complaints.","LOVE, but there is a glitch"

4,2020-08-15 02:29:40,So I was commenting on a level called how then it said I got banned because my password was insecure and I needed to change it. So I changed it but now it doesn’t say I’m banned but I says error. So now when I click on my profile it says something went wrong and I can’t comment either. I also can’t look at the leaderboard. But it’s probably one of my favorite games. :D also if you could help I’d appreciate it.,My account is hacked (maybe)
5,2021-05-14 22:25:37,I love geometry dash so much!!!!! Great game and if it wasn’t made by you guys it would’ve been the most boring game ever! The fact you guys turned a jumping cube into such an amazing game is so cool. Also my favorite genre is dubstep and most official levels have dubstep songs and you guys really made the genre shine. Something cool would be a scale trigger in the editor. Nice game and keep it up!!,Read please
2,2021-02-19 10:23:41,"The game is somewhat fun and equally infuriating. The worst part is my progress from the past is all but deleted. It is still on the server, I can see through my friend's phone. Even after signing in and being signed in for weeks, refreshing account (which is always suggested BUT DOES NOT WORK), and unlinking, then signing back in, I cannot load my save data.

5,2020-11-11 03:43:46,"I think a new difficulty is needed. extreme is the name that I have for it, and it is a purple face that is even more mad than the insane difficulty face. It is between the easy demon and the insane difficultys. Clutterfunk will be extreme maybe I guess, electrodynamix will be extreme, and hex force will maybe but idk know about hex or clutterfunk because they are kinda easy. Also can robtop make it so we can copy main levels?",This game is 👍
5,2020-10-06 04:48:41,As you know when you’re in the dual game mode your dual uses the secondary color as the primary so i have an idea for 2.2 if you can make an option in options section for the dual to use the same colors as your other icon (idk what to call it) because i dont like the dual using the secondary color as primary because i could do it but i have to get a texture pack.,One idea for 2.2
5,2020-09-17 01:07:54,I’m pretty decent at the game. I have about 50 something demons. But something is missing. 2.2.it’s been like 4 years. 2.2 needs to be released right about now or else the game is just going to die. I was in 5th grade when 2.1 was released. I’m in high school now and 2.2 still hasn’t been released. Not even a sneak peek. Nothing. It really needs to be released or else robtop is just going to kill his own game.,Good
4,2019-01-08 16:45:43,"This  game has good music, levels, and mechanics. But you could make the game a little bit more simple, because it takes a while to make the levels and has some very an advanced mechanics that kinda take a bit to station correctly. But on the bright side you can make your own levels with your own soundtracks what more could you want, the answer is a little bit more. So this game needs a in game guide",Great game except
5,2020-08-06 14:09:16,"So, I played Geometry Dash for a LONG time and came with ideas! 1: Comet/ The comet is like the cube but you will keep jumping when on the ground, then if you tap in midair then you will go down rapidly 2: New icon editor/ So if you want to customize your icons, it will cost ten diamonds to do the cube, ship, ball, unidentified flying object (UFO) wave, robot, and spider. 3: Swing Copter/ We all wanted this game mode so much! So if you click then the SC will change your gravity! 4: Spring Board/ This game mode is kind of like the comet but when you are on the ground then you will jump higher! 5: Layouts/ In geometry dash subzero there is layouts! So RobTop if adds layouts to the game, we can do reverse orbs without using move triggers",2.2 ideas
5,2020-04-11 23:48:44,This game is so fun! Lots of new unlocks and great fun! You have the level editor and you have achievements and the lost gauntlets you have the week-ly level this is fun I’m ready when you are for super full ver. 2.2 I will immediately get 2.2 when you are ready I’m ready when you are that I can wait for Christmas so like full ver. 2.2 is like a Christmas present for us well when it is Christmas MERRY CHRISTMAS,I love it
5,2019-04-14 14:19:24,"At the time of writing, I’ve played this game for 2 years and it’s still a really fun game. The reason why I rated 3 stars instead of 5 is because the updates take so long. This isn’t a dead game either. The developer just takes a couple years for a new update. It’s now been 2 and almost 3 years since the last major update for this game.","Great game, but horrible update waits"
5,2017-11-24 19:25:31,"So here’s my problem. It’s not letting me download songs, nor upload levels. (And no it’s not my WiFi.) I don’t understand why it’s doing this. Maybe it’s update 2.1 but I really don’t care, as long as it gets fixed. Other than this fairly big issue, this app gets five stars, and I definitely recommend it to others. Money well spent. 👌👌 Well done RubRub.",This is a problem.
5,2023-11-04 15:37:45,"I am writing this in November before 2.2 comes out and the sneak peeks, the trailer, everything makes this update seem like it will be amazing.

Also when you have the percentage of where you lose then go to practice mode and beat the level like 2-5 times and then it gets easier well a demon like 5-12 times.,BEST GAME EVER

But, I’ll let it pass because to show that, there is a + on the side of the title to indicate that, and there is a setting to lower the games visuals that are included.

People are starting to delete the game because the update isn’t coming. I am going to stay in gd even if there isn’t any update ngl. Maybe you can try splitting the update to parts instead of making the update all at once.,Great game but I’m still waiting for 2.2

4,2019-05-30 00:45:59,"This game is amazing and all, but the thing that I mostly get disappointed by is how long the updates take to get released. I mean, it has been January 2017 since there was a last update (which that update was 2.11). I know RobTop has some pressure on trying to get the update released but still, it does take very long for RobTop to get an update to be done and released.

I am a teenager now, what are the plans for 2.3 there probably won’t be anything left to do after that because there is too many new things that will be added.

5,2021-06-16 18:53:33,There is 2 glitches that I hate. One of them is if I go out of a game and come back the music is not there but the sound fx are. If you could fix that that would be great.

5,2017-07-21 23:14:28,I am well a veteran at this game I can beat the first few levels on my first try and it's cool to brag to all of my friends about my one try. Unfortunate I wanted to unlock all the STUFF (fun right?) so I did most of the levels in practice mode. PRACTICE not the actual thing... and it counts as tries! What!!!!??? If you fail 10 times in practice +10 tries in the level. Disappointing but none the less a great game.,Hmm

Although this is a fun game it can lead to stress and rage due to the difficulty of the levels most of them are not so challenging but some are. Another the that I think needs work on is the updates. The updates to that game take to long such it took a year from 2.1 to 2.11 and that’s just one. But the gameplay is very nice and the editor is too.,Amazing but difficult

After the purchase I was excited to play and was disappointed to find the game crashing every time I try to open it. I have restarted my phone and deleted and redownloaded the game. Doing research I came to the conclusion that it is most likely due to the IOS 17 update. This seems to be universal and was hoping that the app would be updated and fixed so I could play again. Hoping you see this because of how long the last update was!  Thank you!,Crashing
4,2023-10-08 19:04:16,Robtop or Apple there’s a problem I’m not the only one the game is kept on kicking me out when I join I spent $2 on this game and now I can’t join like bro please fix this I don’t want to Wait for 2.2 I want the try 2.1 1st I mean the spin offs work but it’s not enough I want to make my own levels. Oh and when is 2.2 coming I know it’s October but when is the release date? Not month.,Not letting me join
5,2023-10-14 00:29:48,First of all don’t take this the wrong way I love geometry dash and the game itself and s great but I have this wired glitch that when I try and open the game it crashes every time I try multiple times a day to open to see if it’s fixed so if you see this PLEASE fix it or do as much as you can. Thanks!,1 complaint
5,2023-10-11 10:45:23,"For the people who’s games aren’t opening, i think this is because the game has been inactive for so long. If you updated your device to the newest update then i don’t think you can play this. This should be fixed in 2.2 which comes out this month so just be patient",Game not opening
4,2022-12-03 03:54:20,So I like it but there are a few bugs i press the button to jump and sometimes it Just doesn’t work and sometimes it won’t stop jumping like it just keeps jumping and I die on a spike but all and all it is a pretty good game I would like it better if it had less bugs I would like it if you fixed those but it’s a good game thanks for creating it,Good but a few bugs
5,2023-09-27 12:06:08,"This game is really fun and I love playing it but now anytime I try to load up the game, it will open and shut right away, i’ve tried reinstalling it resetting my phone and even trying to off load the app. I did try to clear up storage but it didn’t work. Could someone try to help me out?",Not opening
5,2023-07-02 03:47:05,"Tbh, it’s a really awesome game with creative level ideas and playable user-made levels.   However, I am extremely curious as to when 2.2 will come out. After seeing the past 3 sneak peeks, I am really excited, and wondering how the update is going to come out.   Overall, it’s a really creative, groundbreaking experience.",When is 2.2?
5,2023-06-08 22:40:09,"I cannot wait for 2.2 I will be back first update yet. I will be in the studio madness time machine so much more. It is just the best game ever. I play it every single day you got hacked though, but I still love it there’s a bunch of things to do. You should totally download it rob top if you’re seeing this one wall 2.2 come out.",This is the best game ever played
5,2023-05-26 17:27:31,"Now I know what your thinking, a couple dollars for a game that hasn’t been updated in years but 2.2 (the next new update) is just around the corner and there is so much you can do in 2.2 like the map, new icons, new main levels, new editor triggers and blocks, and so much more!","If you love rhythm games, this is for you"
5,2023-01-29 13:21:13,Geometry Dash is a great game and challenging but can you switch the ratings on Fingerdash and Cycles. I just think Fingerdash is not really a Insane level it’s more of a harder level same with Cycles it’s not really a harder level. I got 81% on Fingerdash but only 30% on cycles. Please change the ratings on those levels.                    (Btw the game is awesome)                     (Everyone is awesome),Great game!
1,2023-01-13 12:48:57,"It’s not fair that some people on older phones or any handheld object can’t play anymore just because of a software update. I suggest you either update your game so we can play, or refund everyone. I know for a fact these people who want to play won’t stop until you give them what you want so you better think of something. And before you go “they can buy it on a newer phone or computer” some people don’t have the time or money to buy new electronics. I’m just saying this is making me and a lot of other people made..","Yo Devs, listen.."
5,2022-12-07 04:03:02,As a autistic 14 year old I find this game very fun. Very good for kids with motor skills and autistic children with good memory. Great content moderation and have only seen one minor bad word. Regulates me all the time. Soundtracks also good for autistic kids who get sensory input from edm. A must for any autistic child and will be a timeless classic as soon as you download it. Enjoy the shapes.,Autism friendly
4,2021-12-17 11:54:25,"This is a really good game but on IOS 15  you can’t get into the game. It isn’t just me who experiences problem it is everyone who has this game. Please make 2.2 come out so maybe it can be fixed. The last update came 4 years ago! Saying 2.2 will come soon, I really want to rate five stars because a great game everyone with a Samsung talks about it at schools.",So a good game but iOS 15 makes it a problem
5,2022-10-25 19:01:43,"I’ve played geometry dash since who knows how long, but now I can’t. Every time I try play play the full version of the app, it gets me out. I only see the first screen for like a second, then I get send to Home Screen. I don’t know why, it just happens. Not sure if I’m the only one but who knows, thanks for reading this.","Good game, Bad app"
3,2022-10-24 22:32:43,Whenever I open the app it works for like a millisecond but crashes right after. I’ve spent $2 on Microsoft store and App Store on iPad. I hope you can fix this in maybe the next update or maybe even respond to this message on how to fix since I’ve tried at least 10-20 websites and methods on fixing this and still nothing works. Please work on fixing this and I hope it’ll work soon! Thanks,Crashing repeatedly
5,2022-07-17 01:03:31,"Whenever I join it kicks me out automatically and I barely even see the loading progress bar. Can you fix it? For 2.2, when will it release? It’s been 4 years and it hasn’t released. Also: here’s a custom feature: whenever you go on an event, you have a choice to make it 3D to 2D.",Glitch and 2.2
1,2022-06-08 19:14:39,I’m tired of waiting for 2.2 so I can play the game. You need to update this as people cannot play the game. Stop what your doing and just update so I can play in iOS 1.15.5. This is not a free game it cost money so the fact that I can’t even play after paying money is unacceptable. I haven’t seen you respond to one review so obviously you don’t care that your apps reviews or plummeting. If you don’t have the time get a team of developers or something and actually make robtop mean something. I’m tired of waiting for 2.2 let me play!!!,"To robtop, stop being lazy"
5,2022-05-19 19:54:03,"Geometry Dash is a great game that I love and enjoy playing. However, in iOS 15.5 there is a glitch where the app won’t open. I have tried all of the strategies, shutting it down, forced restart, and deleting and reinstalling, but none of them worked. Hopefully it can be fixed soon so I can get back to playing!","Great game, bad glitch"
3,2022-05-11 19:09:44,"Don’t get me wrong, I love geometry dash and I would rate it higher, but the game just does not work on iOS. Every time I try opening up the game it would close immediately not allowing me to play the game. I even tried reinstalling the game but that doesn’t work either. I hope they can fix this because this is sad. But other than that if the game works it is pretty fun. I just hope they can fix this problem.",Please fix this
5,2021-12-26 03:07:59,"I had this game before and it was great but it has a bug we’re I cannot open the app. I’ve tried with all the other versions Sun-zero, lite, meltdown, and world and only meltdown works so I know your updates take awhile but if this isn't just a issue for me if you have the time can you try to fix it.",Very good game
3,2021-11-20 17:26:23,"Geometry dash is fun! Ever since my friend introduced me to this amazing game I loved it   until the glitch where it would not let me play any other geometry dash game besides the meltdown. I tried deleting games like geometry dash(geometry dash lite, geometry   dash world), restarting my phone, and charging my phone to see if my phone was just low battery . But it just won’t work! I payed money for this game and it won’t work! Please fix you game.",Idk if this is just happening to me
4,2019-06-14 00:48:57,"So, I have been playing gd for a while. i beat my first demon just a bit ago( The laser room). I adore this game. It’s an amazing challenge. But there is one flaw, the game will not let me upload a level. I have verified it, adjusted settings on copying and everything, and then the game is like “yeah,no” and I just don’t know what to do anymore. Robtop, I know updates take time but you need to fix this.                                            -Breadit",Good but one medium large sized flaw
5,2021-05-25 02:23:03,This is the best it had really nice music the levels get harder and harder after ever one and I love challenges. You can also customize and build your own would and characters so you guys should bye this game or you can even get the others version of it same thing but dose not cost any money this is the best game ever,The best game
5,2021-04-13 19:27:10,"I have been playing for 4 years, I have over 10K stars and 80 demons, I love this game, you will never run out of levels to play. Hopefully the new update is released soon. Best $2 I have ever spent in my life. I can see new players having trouble getting used to it because of the difficulty but it just takes time. Love this game <3",Geometry Dash
5,2020-08-16 03:04:23,"Geometry Dash is an incredible and exciting game with so many interesting features!!! My only concern is that the level editor mode is quite difficult to master the controls just because there are so many options. However this game, overall, is so much worth, and maybe even more than the $1.99 that it costs. Thanks so much for such an awesome game Robtop!!!",Amazing Game!!!
5,2020-07-21 19:12:56,"No glitches, and the song uploads are extremely fast! You should definitely get it! And it doesn’t take up that much space in your data! If you don’t like music games then you won’t like it because you jump to the tune of whatever song it is for that level. Overall this is a really good game! It’s Good for people who like jumping games!",It’s awesome
5,2020-05-09 16:37:07,"This is an awesome game, would recommend to everyone, but there’s just one flaw. Dislike bots. They are taking over GD and a lot of the Featured levels have a lot of dislikes or don’t have as much likes as they should. Reason? Dislike bots. Once again, this is a great game, just fix that issue and everything will be good.",Just one Flaw
5,2020-01-23 02:22:18,"Robtop, bravo! Great game! There’s just a glitch in my favorite level, deadlocked. There is a glitch in the first ball section, where you would be going through one of the portals, (that actually teleport you) and I would literally just die out of the blue. Again robtop, it would be GREATLY appreciated if you fixed this bug, as I have died here... let’s just say TOO many times. THX",Deadlocked glitches
5,2020-01-12 20:15:57,"Hi rubrub. I have had such a fun time playing this game. I have been playing for three months straight every day cause it is so fun. I also really like the other versions of the game. I hope you release 2.2 soon. I really want to play this until I am at least 40 years old or older. I am a kid right now but I still love your game. Keep up the good work. Sincerely, your biggest fan",Awesome game
5,2019-12-14 14:00:07,"I can’t upload any levels. Every time I try it, I’m told there was an issue and I should try again. Typically, that’s for one or two levels, right? No, this is EVERY level.

Maybe I was hacked?  -AceDelta12",Is my entire game broken?!
5,2019-11-30 19:15:43,"I love this game, and I have only been playing for a few weeks.  The level editor is a wonderful touch to the old edition and the new levels are also excellent.  The only thing that I would change if I could would be adding text in the level editor.  Otherwise, this is a great game to get for only $2.",This game is awesome and extremely addicting!
5,2019-10-21 00:06:39,"This game is the. bomb. and I love everything about it, be it the level design to the level editor to the community to the side challenges, but there's been a lack of updates recently. Last year, I was like, ""oh yeah, 2.2'll be here by December!!!"" LAST YEAR. So my only problem with the game is the amount of time 2.2 is taking. Other than that, Geometry Dash is a must-buy.","Great game, but... WHERE IS 2.2!?"
4,2019-01-07 00:47:49,"The game is full of things to do and is very fun! I love this game! But two things: the game takes a bit to get used to. At first it might not be very fun because you’re not good at the game. But as you continue you will find it more fun. Another thing is that the creator, (robtop) doesn’t get the updates out very fast. The updates are usually pretty big, but you have to wait a REALLY long time for it to come out. Very good game I recommend!",Very good game!
5,2019-02-17 05:59:29,So I have all the icons in GD meltdown and world (still working on subzero) and I want to get the icons from GD world and meltdown on to GD full version and I’ve looked it up and can’t find anything on how it just doesn’t work so we need a button that transfers the icons from one game to another (I do have an account) so I hope u can tell me how to do this and/or make it easier thx for making this <3<3<3<3<3<3 :D,Icons...
5,2019-02-14 04:16:09,"It’s a good game I just have a problem with how you get texture packs on your iOS IPhone . It makes no sense and I’ll like in 2.2 for it to be easier to add texture packs,  for example being a folder icon in the icons area and when you press it it gives you default texture packs and downloaded texture packs,  when you click one it sets it automatically.",Texture packs
4,2018-02-19 04:00:25,"So I have been playing geometry dash for a long time when I was young, but when I got my new iPad and logged back into my account, all my progress was had gone to reset!

5,2018-07-04 19:40:52,"The game is challenging but not off-putting by giving you constant rewards, it keeps it fun to play while also adding levels and allowing players to create their own levels which adds to the games community as well as its longevity. I have been a fan of geometry dash and recommend to any people looking for a challenge that tests your rhythmic skills.",Good game. Good music
5,2018-04-17 03:08:13,"This is a fun game to kill time, yes their are bugs in the game itself and the levels. For the average user that does a few attempts and calls it a day you should get the lite. If you come from the lite version you have to put time, patience and practice to unlock the full potential. Ohh and by the way the updates aren’t frequent =]  P.s You need a lot patience to really enjoy this game",FUN GAME but....
5,2018-02-20 17:35:39,When I started Geometry Dash on this phone it was the best but when I updated Geometry – do you want to put an 11 it’s actually deleted up I can’t upload levels anymore so I deleted the app and re-uploaded stuff and it didn’t let me restore my stuff and now it’s kind of annoying but I think it might be better to start up a new game,Amazing but one thing
4,2017-07-06 23:06:47,"Lots of amazing updates make the game fun but as I have been playing I found a couple bugs that would be easy to patch like when your editing and test you get stuck in blocks so far that's all the bugs I found. But what was interesting was auto levels they are so exciting, it allows you to make a story or learn levels to be honest I love geometry dash and hope RobTop makes more updates.😃","Amazing,Wonderful,Exciting"

4,2017-01-22 01:44:54,The new update it's great and all but I have one problem with the editor so far... I need to make a separate rotate trigger for each and everything I want to rotate and if I use the same rotate trigger for two groups of objects spinning at the same time they just don't spin...

5,2017-04-29 01:17:02,"This is hands down the best game on the App Store but, there are a few bugs that need to be fixed.

5,2017-01-27 16:32:23,2.1 is by far the best update in my opinion but for some reason the lost gauntlets won't load this is not just happening for me but it's also happening for my friend I don't think it's my device because I have an iPhone 5S but my friend has a iPhone 7 and it also doesn't work for him please fix this I need the gauntlets to get the first key you know what mean~,Good but the BUGSSS😫😫

4,2020-12-28 23:00:03,"Hey, RobTop! I'd like to say that this game is really, really cool, but there are a couple of bugs and glitches in the Level Editor. First of all, some of the blocks in the editor disappear, and I have to re-build that thing. Second, when I color something, later, that thing becomes the default color again, for example, if the block is white and then I color it green, later it becomes white again. Lastly, some of the blocks themself glitch out, like when a block overlaps another block when it's not supposed to, or when the front block goes to the back layer.  This is overall a great game with a few glitches, but I still enjoy it.  :)  Also, when is 2.2 coming out?","Cool, cool"
5,2021-10-14 23:37:38,I overall love GD there are a few problems though.I’m unable to open my daily chests and the wave trail is kinda buggy.

5,2021-05-21 14:10:30,"Whenever I tried making a level and publishing it, it would always say “upload failed. Please try again later.” The main reason why i got the full geometry dash was to make my own levels so it was kinda disappointing when I couldn’t publish then",Great game but one problem
4,2020-08-19 21:05:46,I can’t make and account I can’t figure out why. I have all the correct info and it still says my email is wrong! I’m also on phone I don’t know if that makes any difference but please fix it! Also I can’t share my levels that’s where the account problem started happening I thought I had to have an account to share my levels so then that happened..,Love it. but there’s and issue.
5,2020-11-13 07:50:25,"I do love this game, so much.. but i downloaded this game in a very old phone and i was planning to buy a new one so i tried making an account but it said the email was invalid.. then i tried it with several other emails but it had the same problem...  if anyone knows how to fix this, please.. please tell me how.",I just need help with making an account
5,2020-11-08 12:39:53,"I love this game, it’s always been my favorite for the last 6 years, but within the last few months, the game doesn’t work as it should. This is mainly because of iOS 14 breaking the wave trail, but now the newest update makes my game crash whenever I load it. I am unable to play at all, and this is absolutely stupid.","Great game, but I have some issues now"
2,2020-09-12 04:46:06,"okay so I’ve been playing gd lite for about a year now, I even downloaded gd sub zero and gd worlds. I worked all day and finished the levels. And each of them mentioned the full version of geometry dash, so I bought it. ALL my work from the original gd is GONE and I have to restart everything. I was so annoyed so I go to gd worlds and guess what?? I STILL HAVE ACCESS TO NOTHING. I re opened the app, and if I delete the other apps then I’m going to lose all of my hard work. This is straight up ridiculous. By far ANNOYED.",soo... now what?
5,2020-09-04 20:43:05,"I love this game so much! It is so fun and time consuming,  and has great music! If you aren’t already, PLEASE make new levels! I would be so exited! Also... on Time Machine, there is an auto jump the second time I go upside down. But it only auto jumps if I jump right before the spike. I have to jump when it seems to early, then it glitches and I’m ok. That’s the only complaint!",Geometry Dash!
5,2020-08-16 02:11:00,"this is the best game and best community nothing to say but have a problem with acc hacker i have a acc and beat 5 demon make a lot of buiding now it gone by a hacker my layout,map everything gone i have to make a new acc and now i feel like i dont want to play it anymore my old acc IGN:Masterka2478 hope u see this also when 2.2",best game in the world
5,2020-05-28 23:54:24,I luvvvvv this game and recommend it for people who love big challenges but it has lots of bad stuff with it like hackers racism & inappropriate things like I saw a fat man with a braw on and a man sticking his hand into a girl’s butthole.  I think every level that was uploaded should be sent to rob top so they can see if any of this happens so it can be deleted from the servers,Luvvv but....
5,2020-02-17 20:48:14,"Geometry dash is soooo cool! I LOVE the level maker! I get to make all the levels i want! I get to play all the levels from  people from all over the world! But there is a problem, i can’t upload any of the levels i make. Out of all the 19 levels i made, i can’t upload any of them. Anyways, great game",Such a good game! Just 1 problem though
5,2019-11-02 16:45:11,"So first of all when it came out i was all like ""cool game"" and bought it a month later. Honestly i though id play the game for around 2 months and just drop it like i do like all the other games i play. Now here i am years later enjoying my time playing levels and trying to improve at the one level im trying to beat. Overall amazing game",An Amazing Game
5,2019-05-25 15:08:35,"This is by far the most fun game I’ve ever played. I am so obsessed and addicted to this game I get in trouble for playing it so much. I have it on my PC, my iPhone AND my iPad. I’m 12 and I’ve been playing this since 1.7. This game has huge replay value since there is a level creator/editor and online levels. I LOVE this game so frustratingly much I can’t stress that enough.","Addictive, Creative, Outstanding."
5,2018-11-24 06:33:34,This is an awesome game I play it all the time. You should add  more characters and you should add more types of spikes. Add a conveyor belt that consists of moving spikes. You should add little monsters that or Rome around the game and follow you and you should have to tap them to make them disappear. They should just appear randomly in any level.,Love the parked where you can create your own level
5,2018-07-21 04:39:07,Trust me this is an amazing game. All of the one star reviews are just people who are mad that there bad at the game. If you are bad at this game then just go to the community levels and find some easy ones. In fact the most liked community level in the game is extremely easy. I’ve recommended many people to get this game and I hop that you will do the same :),They are angry
4,2017-11-26 14:46:13,"I think that this game is really fun I would play it all day, but it cost money and I feel like most people don’t buy games. Also I think that some of the easy level are actually really hard I feel like that i have a really hard time completing levels, it took me about 1 month to complete the very first level. Over all I think this game is awesome and definitely recommend.","Really fun, but some problems"
5,2018-06-12 16:54:47,I love geometry dash sooo much but here is something I recommend. I want to make my own icon/ball/ship/wave so I can look better. But you should have it so you have to spend something on it (not real money because it’s a free game) like for example: diamonds so I hope you see this and please I hope you change that to make your own icons. Thanks!,This is great!!! Just a suggestion..
5,2018-05-31 20:48:10,"The game is overall really great and fun, the only problem is that sometimes when I jump, it reacts a whole second late which frustrates me, then there are just lags happening suddenly and I use an IPhone8+ which is the fastest iPhone yet. I don’t understand why it’s lagging on the fastest phone yet and I hope you can fix this as soon as possible",Jump lag...
4,2023-10-24 20:37:44,So this game was my dream game that I always wanted to get them I finally got it but there’s a problem my email keeps on saying invalid and already in use so if this happens to you then write a review I hope the developers can see this cause I need it fixed I make awesome levels I’m super intelligent and nice at building stuff so if you buy this game just know,I can’t make an account
5,2017-07-14 21:27:44,"This game is worth rating all five stars! The levels are hard and very fun to traverse, and I love the different character styles. I just want to report a bug, though. I bought a new cube style from the shop, but when I used a different cube for a level, I couldn't use the cube that I got. And I had to re-purchase it. That's the only problem I found. I love this game!",Amazing game!
2,2017-03-20 20:05:30,"its great dont get me  wrong. I have a few requests for update 2.2. So first is that you should be able to create group like things where you and everyone in your group can create levels together. i know you can make levels with people now but it would be easier with groups. Also diamonds should be used for more stuff. The only things diamonds are used for are achievements, the challenge and the secret shop. But i feel that they need more... But thats it. i hope 2.2 comes soon",i have some suggestions
5,2017-02-08 16:22:23,"So I've played this game for a long time and I love it. And finally 2.1 came out and the gauntlets work, which I'm glad about, but could you add more map pack, we're in 2.1 finally and there are some I haven't beaten which are from like 1.7 or 1.8 and it gets a little old, can you add map packs with 2.1 levels, kind of like the gauntlets? If you did that would be awesome!!",Awesome game!
5,2017-01-30 08:43:15,"This game is extremely addictive, probably the most addicting game I have ever played. This game is perfect to play whenever you are bored, or if you have no wifi. I personally think it is worth paying $2 for because it allows you to make your own levels, unlock fantastic characters, and go on fun adventures. So without further ado, get the app and have fun!",Timekiller
4,2022-06-07 09:13:21,"Great game, an awesome blend of rhythm, platforming and challenging gameplay. The issue right now is that the game has stopped working on my phone and now every time I try to open it, it crashes instantly. If someone could help me fix this problem that would be greatly appreciated. It’s such a fun game and this bug is really frustrating.","Used to love this game, now it crashes on launch"
5,2023-10-21 20:11:21,"With 2.2 coming out this month and an amazing trailer released, this game is a masterpiece. Including its developer who has been working hard on the new updates. This game is a super fun game to play with dazzling colors and amazing graphics and music, it has great developer-made and user-made levels that wont ever get old!","Amazing Game, Better Developer"
5,2023-10-11 20:41:41,"This game is amazing and could be really frustrating sometimes but ever since the iOS 17 update it keeps kicking me out the game. I tried watching videos to see if it could help me, but none of them have worked. I hope that they could fix this issue soon.",It keeps kicking me out
5,2023-10-10 16:54:08,I live this game I’ve been playing on mobile since it came out but now that I downloaded IOS 17 I can’t play it anymore because apple shut it down because it hasn’t been put in 6 years so Robtop if you see this pls upload the update so I can play geometry dash agian I don’t wanna lose my stats. my geometry dash name is Bonw.,Rubrub
5,2023-06-01 14:28:01,"Thanks to my cousin Halle, I was able to know the speed, color and fun that is Geometry Dash. I’ve been playing since 1.9, and I’ve gotten so good and officially into its community. I love everything about it, and it’s my go-to mobile game. No Wi-Fi needed! One thing though. 2.11 has been the update we’ve been stuck on for 5 YEARS. Where’s 2.2 Robtop?",I love GD!
5,2022-11-25 01:31:30,This is a very cool game I haven’t played this game in a year. I’m so bad now. But I could skins a handle this game. I make very hard levels. And weird levels. Just to let you know that my players name is [PowerfulOne] and try my levels. Please like my crazy levels I don’t care if you dislike or like my weird levels.,Geometry dash is really cool. But hard
2,2022-11-21 06:31:11,"I love this game genuinely with all of my heart, which makes me even more frustrated when certain problems with the iOS version keep this from holding a candle to ANY other version of the game. Problems with the music, certain cosmetics, my account never saving when I sign in, and having it kick me out every time the app relaunches (this is the most upsetting to me) which creates even more issues when my created levels duplicate and it all becomes a big mess, it’s really a shame.",😭
5,2022-08-12 01:33:16,"I am not sure if this happens to anyone else but now when I try to load the game it boots me before I even reach the title screen, I haven’t been able to play and I’m hoping this can be fixed this is a great game and I love listening to the music, thank you and I look forward to geo dashing soon",I have a problem
3,2022-07-24 14:23:29,This only happens on this game it did happen on subzero but I could fix that whenever I get on the app it just throws me back onto my home screen I can’t even play a single level it just shows robtop games for a split moment and then I get thrown back onto the Home Screen  pls fix that I just love all the games and I’ve been wanting this one for a really long time please fix this pretty please,Good games but one big problem
5,2022-07-18 20:29:48,"So, I have a question. What happens when the app won’t open. I love the game which is why I’m giving it 5 stars and I do t know if it’s robtops fault but every time I open the app it show me the name of the creator and just closes the application. If anyone has any information on this and can help me it would be much appreciated.",I need help
5,2022-07-18 11:37:52,"Awesome game overall but there is an issue, I think it’s just for iOS cause when I go in the app it crashes instantly. I get kicked out of the game and I can’t play any of the levels. Robtop, I think you should fix this like you did with subzero but I been playing for 3 years and please fix it.",Good but problems..
3,2022-05-16 22:51:25,"This game is great! I mean a real time killer when your bored. But the reason I’m giving this a 3 star review is cause, I can’t play the game. Upon downloading I was able to play. But around 3 to 5 weeks later it kicks me out when I try to join. I’ve deleted photos and apps but nothing is happening. I hope this eventually stops and I could play again. Until then this game gets a 3 star review",Kicks me out when I try to join :/
4,2022-02-17 22:03:40,Still sound glitch.   There is a sound glitch that happens when you exit and enter the app which happens when you exit and re enter the app. It is very annoying when I pause the game to do something and then come back to play and no music plays. The decorations/orbs will glitch out and stay big/small. Plz fix. THX!,Annoying Sound Glitch
5,2022-04-06 14:27:53,I gave it a five star because it’s a great game but recently when I try to load in the game it doesn’t allow me to like it loads then kicks me out of the game. I’ve tried to restart my phone and uninstall and reinstall the game but it still isn’t working is there anything I can do to fix this?,Game broken
5,2022-03-09 00:20:49,Hi! So I wanted to say the app is WONDERFUL and so much fun. But I can’t play it anymore on my iPad because when I open it it goes to the Home Screen then kicks me out. I tried re-downloading it but the same keeps happening. It worked earlier this year but I don’t know what happened. Does the app not support it now? 😢,Awesome app but has a sad problem
4,2020-02-17 23:00:45,"I love the game, it’s addicting and always play it but there are way to many ads.  The reason I don’t enjoy the ads is because one minute you’re grinding on a level and trying to beat it but all of a sudden, there’s a 2 minute long ad keeping you from playing.  But other than that the game is perfect.  The interesting eastereggs, the gameplay, everything is just amazing!",Amazing game but...too many ads
5,2022-02-06 00:10:54,"When I bought the game the game was working perfectly fine, until a few weeks I don’t know what happened that I try to enter to the game and it kick me out every time, I try to deleted it and install it again or restarting the phone again and nothing works.",Can someone help me?

Im on icloud btw. Oh and GET RID OF THE OBJECT LIMIT! Like what is the point of object limit. I’m Right now creating a good level but I know deep inside that It will go over 80,000 blocks. And I’m on mobile so I can’t hack! Pls get rid of object limit!",Pros and cons. Read this rob.
5,2020-05-31 18:40:00,"This is a amazing game. It has kept me busy for a long time now. I have one complaint, the levels are hard, but I am not amazing at the game. The full version is so worth the money which is insignificant compared to the functionality you get from it. I am making a level that I cannot wait to finish a post. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",Omg GD
5,2020-05-01 20:42:52,"Ok I just wanna say that this game is a very good game, but has some ups and downs. I only wanted to say how something doesn't make sense in the starter levels like stereo madness and back on track and so on but the three demons shouldn't they be easy demons? Its kind of a big jump from insane to hard demon. Besides that the game is good and really keeps me playing!!",Pretty good
5,2019-12-16 11:30:29,"I love this game from back when jumper was the hardest level, it’s basically been my childhood games, but needs a new update soon. I’m still rating this 5 stars but at least make the update in at least a year, just saying because since the last update it’s been 2 years.","Very addicting game, but needs a new update soon"

5,2018-05-13 13:47:10,"I have played a few demons (sadly I only got 1% on killbot) and am very close to beating stigma, the new weekly demon. Nowadays, of course, people are making harder and harder levels (sadly, dark orange, not you), and I am beginning to wonder- What will 2.2 demons be like? They could practically be like Dashy Square spin-offs. Just wondering if Rob could add screen spin, too.","Hard Levels, but that just means more excitement!"
5,2018-02-18 14:57:11,"This is game is awesome and one of the most satisfying things you’ll ever play. Great community, a developer that actually listens, tons of secrets, and endless possibilities. From simple and fun levels (like Retray by Dimavikulov) to the downright evil ones (ahem, Bloodbath), you’ll be screaming your head off. From Stereo Madness to Deadlocked, Fire Gauntlet to Doom Gauntlet, first attempt to 602nd, this game is non-stop blood, sweat, and tears, with satisfaction as your everlasting reward.",Perfect.
5,2017-12-27 15:10:59,I like this game but there are few bugs and thank you for adding in creative mode that you can move around because you use to have to go to edit to move around but thank you anyway for a great game but still it could use a little adjustment when you are moving and when you hold not to jump. Atill though I really enjoy this game!,GG
3,2018-01-19 00:47:53,"This game is really fun and I have never really had any technical issues. The reason I’m giving this game a lower review than I would want to is because the developers don’t add new levels to this game. They make entirely separate games that are unfinished instead of adding the levels to the original game. This requires you to download multiple different games for no reason. I would give 5 starts if all the levels on all games were on 1 game, geometry dash.","Great Game, Needs Improvement"
5,2017-12-01 23:40:50,When the game released I thought it would be easy. But later on it got harder then in order to play and get more things you are gonna have to pay $2 which is a good deal. Most people think this game is boring and hard but it’s actually fun but first try the geometry dash lite to the hang of what you are gonna buy.:) overall 5 stars on this great amazing game.,Good Game

5,2017-03-26 16:51:34,"2.1 is GREAT but ever since I got it it's been lagging from time to time. Also, my game usually now runs at like 10 or 15 fps which means it's harder to control the ship.

5,2023-03-26 22:34:54,I think there should be a portal and orb that makes you go backwards and color it orange and there should be a character that when it jumps it goes backwards and forwards so you can have a secret coin and there should be FAKE coins and that’s it to say and hope you like the ideas 😀👍,New things I think should be released 👾

The levels are at the perfect difficulty for fast or slow people. And the avatars are so cool! Ngl, but this is my favorite game. I love geometry dash so much, that I have gd game that I know, meltdown, geometry dash lite, subzero, I don’t know any others",BEST GAME EVAAAAA
5,2022-02-06 18:42:25,The only problems I’ve had are that I can’t get an account even tho I’ve done everything correctly  2 when I installed an update to my Grandma’s ipad I can’t load the game anymore and 3 the sound problem mentioned in other reviews . Other than that the game is perfect,This game is pretty  much perfect
5,2021-11-06 00:40:18,Hey rob!!! This game is absolutely amazing. I play this every day! I just want to alert you that there is a bug with the new iPhone update “IOS 15”. Whenever I try to open the app it automatically closes and therefore I can no longer play this game. Please please please! Fix this bug in the 2.2 update. Thank you so much! Yo ur amazing rob <3,IOS 15 bug
4,2019-04-13 16:46:10,"There was one thing rubrub forgot to do when he released 2.2. And that was RELEASE THE UPDATE FOR MOBILE PLAYERS. So people like me are stuck in 2.11 and IT REALLY SUCCS. If ur reading this on the computer, go ahead, get the game, but if ur on ur phone or something, then think twice. Not to mention it seems like rubrub just ditched the mobile players. We have been waiting for 2.2 since 2016 and its now 2019 and rubrub STILL hasnt released it for mobile.",Dont get this on mobile
5,2021-01-09 01:12:26,Extremely good game but I just can’t beat time machine even tho I’ve beaten finger dash and geometrical dominator first I think time machine should be updated so it’s easier of at least an insane level and also it needs to c.ome our on switch in America not just the uk also there is a glitch when I try to make an account any way good game I can’t wait for 2.2,2things to say
5,2021-01-08 02:26:24,"Ah, Geometry Dash. I love it sometimes, I hate it sometimes. Beating demons and star-grinding are awesome, and the entire level editor is a beautiful creation everyone should learn how to use. The user-generated content and the community in this game is unmatched. The YouTubers and streamers are amazing. Heck, even the songs are bops. It’s also the hardest game ever made (by a long shot) and tied for the most fun game ever made with Beat Saber. Easily 5 stars.  BUT: Update 2.2 hasn’t come out yet. Update 2.2 that was supposed to come out after the ‘quick pre-update’ in 2017.  2017.  Robtop, it’s been four years since 2.11. Please consider releasing 2.2 soon.  Your devoted and loving fan,  peri. (in-game name is “peridemon”)",You know what I’m gonna say.
5,2020-07-26 16:08:11,Geometry dash is great! Sure it doesn’t have 2.2 yet but just imagine what 2.2 will be in the future I’m not very worried about when 2.2 will come out because I’m still completing all the achievements that are in the game and there’s sooo many levels so I never get bored this is a 5 star game in my opinion sry for this being short my finger are starting to hurt ;-;,A must have game
5,2020-06-26 17:40:40,"I think geometry dash is a really fun game, but I wish there were more levels. Even though 21 levels is a lot, it would also be fun if there were more, and people that beat the game would have more levels to beat. This game is probably my 2nd favorite game  but it might be my 1st if there were more levels.",I think geometry dash should have more levels
5,2020-05-26 17:55:11,"I just wanted to say, thanks so much for making this game. I don’t care what others say about it, it’s super fun!! Also making levels is fun. I do have one recommendation, could you add a feature for the level maker; the idea I have for it is you could add a feature that you could add your own music to it.",Thanks
5,2020-02-01 20:21:38,"I know, 2.2 is coming, but I’m just giving ideas for the next update. 1. Giant Mode 2. New Glow Skins 3. New Rating: Simple 4. New Gamemode: The Box The Box moves in the air and tap on a block path and it will teleport to the exact spot you tapped / clicked 5. 2 New Backgrounds And Grounds 6. Advanced Size Tool 7. Better Test run Tool 8. Eye Animation’s (yes it will be hard I know) 9. Create A Character It’s a character creator where you can use custom parts to make your own, unique, Icon!

5,2019-08-16 15:55:26,"It’s a good game and all , but it gets boring after awhile :( , The creator hasn’t updated the game for 2 years and I think he does not do his job . 2.2 will not come out and the game is just jumping with a cube :/ and the update release dates for 2.2 already passed and why is it 2.11 when it’s not even 2.2 :( , I still play the game and it’s great! But it needs to be updated",Robtops job
5,2019-06-21 03:08:50,"👏👏👏👏👏 Great job Robert... YOU STILL HAVEN’T RELEASED 2.2! I love the game a lot, but get yourself together man! XD that’s a joke btw. There are a couple problems like copyright, but it’s not your fault. The music from this has led me right to what I want to be when I get older. Keep up the work on 2.2 even though everyone is rushing you, guy that made Boomlings. 👍🏻",RubRub we need 2.2 now. Everyone is waiting for you to update
4,2018-08-01 06:32:32,"As a Loyal fan to geometry dash, the Updates Get, Slower and slower, And I feel Like 2.1 Isn't Enough Especially because Only ""Popular"" People Get Featured. I hope that 2.2 Will Make building a Level easier. Since the introduction of blocks with edges It felt Like I was Taking Longer than I really needed to to make something good. I hope that we Get 2.2 By November. (hopefully) but anyways this is to encourage Robtop to Hurry up on 2.2.",Where is 2.2?
5,2018-08-22 22:04:28,"This game is super fun and when u get to the later levels, it gets super difficult, which I love. The unlockables are cool plus you can get even more levels for those who just try a little extra, not to mention you can create and play other people’s levels. The soundtrack is amazing and super catchy. This game is super fun and difficult for any age.",Decievingly Hard
4,2023-11-11 02:29:04,"Ok, I have been in love with this game for as long as I can think of but there is just one problem, the game keeps crashing on me every time I try to enter the game because I am an IOS 17 user. Every time I try to get on, it just keeps kicking me out randomly and all the time. So please fix this so that way it will make it better 🙏🙏🙏",I love it but something is not right :(
5,2018-05-18 01:30:51,"This is a great and fun game, and is addicting. I have an idea for a new game for GD. It should be gd of course, but it's infinite. What I mean by this is that it randomly generates different obstacles and form. Ex. Ship or robot. I think it would be cool with randomly spawned speed and direction changes. There could also be different packs like just UFO  or just ship. This would be really cool and I hope to see it one day.",New game
5,2018-01-29 22:04:14,Best game ever!!!!! I love it you can do so many things like make you own level! Also the icons are so cooool also there are no in app purchases so you can’t get in trouble even though some levels are very hard it it makes it fun because it makes it challenging you get daily orbs to!!!!!! !Even though it is very very hard to get demo keys it is still the best game ever!!,Fun game
5,2018-01-10 13:05:37,Every thing about this game is awesome. The graphics are really good and it keeps the fact that it has geometry! It it kind of like Minecraft meets Crossy Road or temple run. It is very simple and if you beat all the game levels there is an infinite list of player made levels from level easy to bloodbath. Great game and worth the money. P.S. I still play it every day,Worth the money and infinite fun
5,2017-08-22 06:03:36,"It's a great copy of the impossible game! Even better than that game! But, since I have been playing it for a while I have been noticing that there has been an endless count of hackers, haters, and racist people. I'm sorry to say that but I just had to. It's just the truth. But overall a great game, but a community I just cannot describe. I'm sorry to burst your bubble but it's just the truth :(",Love it!
4,2023-09-30 23:03:05,I do love this game but the last 2 levels are too hard and clubstep is madness so many hard things this is one of the best games ever but things are just a little to hard and I hop that 2.2 is good and  another thing is I have seen so menu people doing 2.2 are they getting sneak peaks at the game ? And I hop that robtop makes all the levels in a 2.2 still,Why is this so hard

It stopped responding, I was confused and sad, I tried everything but nothing worked can someone explain what happened?","The app keeps crashing, it’s in a state of limbo (🔑🔑🔑🔑🔑🔑🔑)"

4,2023-06-01 07:23:51,I have played geometry dash for many years and realized I hadn’t been playing the actual game I purchased it and was not disappointed it’s a truly amazing game I wish it was more clear about the interface of how to make levels and for me the search bar is slightly iffy at times but otherwise it’s exceptional even the lite version,An overall great game!
4,2023-05-30 19:46:34,"So I think geometry dash is absolutely AMAZING. The game is frustrating but honestly incredibly fun. The online boards, the actual levels, the looks are amazing but I have a massive issue. A few months back geometry dash won’t open when I click it. It keep opening to pitch black and kicking me out! I don’t know how to fix this so if someone can help please do.","Awesome game, massive issue"
4,2022-10-29 20:41:42,"Long-time player here. I’d go on about how I really like this game, but that’s not why I’m writing this review.   The game just won’t open. I’ll try it with Wi-Fi and without it, but a split second after I open it, it’ll crash. I’ll check if it needs an update, and it won’t. I’ll try restarting my iPad, and it still won’t open. I checked the compatibility, and it’s compatible. What’s going on? (For reference, I have an iPad Gen 6 on iOS 15.6.)  For Subzero it’s the same. I’ll try to open it and it crashes, blah blah blah. Yet for some reason, Meltdown works just fine. Really, the only difference is the levels.   Thank you for reading this                     - Sofia",I love it…but it won’t let me play.
5,2023-05-24 02:48:10,I like the way how you can create levels I know you can put decoration even glow you can play levels there are demons you can even go to the vault of secrets. There’s a button that does details when you create a level which is a chain,We can see these stars from the space
5,2023-05-07 02:17:04,"Now, I have no words, this game is just amazing! There are main page levels like stereo madness or back on track, but you can make your own levels as well as play user made levels.

Thank You.",I cant even play it anymore

3,2017-01-30 22:04:32,"I really liked the game. The only thing is I am not able to collect the daily chests that are available after a short period of time. I know the problem is the game because it sometimes lets me collect the chests but mostly doesn't let me collect the chests. These chests have great rewards and the only way I know how to get some of the rewards are from these chests. Otherwise this is a very fun game that requires skill and reflexes with cool music and colorful, vibrant levels.",Great but...
5,2017-01-20 23:23:01,"I love this game. 2.1 is here. And everything is perfect... Except for one bug, I can't view people's profiles/accounts. I tried and tried, even tried using my data.

5,2023-07-19 17:40:44,In my feedback I think more levels is gonna be good so I can play them.

5,2022-05-18 19:20:38,a good game/app I love it! But here some ideas for 2.2! Idea 1 is the icon maker! You can make your own icon it’s it saves to an empty spot in the icon edit icon face menu! Idea 2 is add the lvl badland it’s a good lvl and it has to be demon for 40 coins! And more for it! Last idea is! To add more icons! For the game! More ships. And more balls!

Even if I made the jump, I would die. The game is also slightly expensive and I WANT A  REFUND! The game is not worth $2.00! However, I do like the companions to this game called ""Geometry Dash Meltdown"" and ""Geometry Dash SubZero"" also this game is a big waste of time but it is addictive in the bad way.

2,2021-12-15 03:14:57,"I cannot find support for this developer- website is under construction.  No e-mail, no phone, no address for snail mail.  I’d love to see this and the other four broken geometry dash apps work in iOS 15.  Only meltdown works so far.  6S Plus launches the splash page and immediately closes without error.  I see lots of people on Reddit having the same issue with iOS 15.  I even erased my phone and it still won’t launch fully.",Was five stars… iOS 15 it won’t launch
5,2021-07-24 22:51:51,"This is a great game, because it’s challenging and fun, but there is only 1 problem i have. and NO, ITS NOT 2.2! it’s the fact that i haven’t been able to save my account stuff in a year, and i lost 6 demons because of it. but overall it’s a very fun game, definitely would recommend","Great game, especially for pc!"
4,2021-04-28 22:54:58,Hey! I wanted to say something that i really want the Developer to really add an option that can have you change the practice song because the prectice song is just too boring. Can you please add that feature? It will definitely make this review a 5 star and more players will start playing this! And they and i will love it,Practice song
4,2021-03-03 05:39:55,It’s been three years and there’s still no v2.2. Did you just give up on the game? What’s going on? Or is this some really high effort and quality project that will change the game? Because it’s been three years and there’s not even a single trace of new stuff. Also it does not allow me to create an account or post levels not because they’re unverified but it says error,Time?
5,2021-04-03 02:42:08,"I LOVE this game, but I had taken a break for about 2 months and when I decided to play it when I was bored one time, I tapped it, (Yes I play on Mobile) and it showed the RobTop Logo and then the app closed.

4,2019-09-08 01:55:39,So I got this game like a week ago and It has worked fine! And since like day before yesterday Sometimes it doesn’t let me jump every time I tap and That is making it so when I play I tap on screen and it doesn’t make the character jump and Then I die and I really think that this needs to be fixed (yes I am playing on IPad) please fix it.,this game is Amazing but I got a problem
5,2020-11-10 16:46:05,It is really hard but it’s that kind of game that you can spend hours on and not get bored it’s really fun even if it’s hard and you won’t finish it in 5 minutes I really like the music although sometimes when I go in the game the music stops but there’s a easy fix swipe up the app and go back in the game,Amazing

5,2019-09-09 15:05:11,A very fun game with awesome soundtracks and fun levels! In the creator studio you can make your own custom levels to share with the community! People from all around the world play this game. You can also unlock cool icons to make your cube look awesome! I highly recommend geometry dash to you because I have played it for a long time and had lots of fun! 10/10!,AMAZING
4,2019-06-11 12:18:54,"This Is probably one of the games I’ve ever said is impossible to master . I put great dedication and made it to X-Step 100% 3 coins. At the Time it was the last level so I deleted the game. I downloaded 3 years and 6 months after and wow I saw so many new levels. But I wasn’t signed in and I WAS MAD but who cares. What I didn’t know I needed to be signed in to play other people’s levels and mine too. I got into a new level and I realized 2 MAJOR GLITCHES   1 if you get close too close to a block ,even without touching it you die   2 if you hold jump for too long it auto jumps forever and you can’t stop it   Please fix this and I suggest smoothing the game for old devices -2019",Great Game but Major bugs that are from 2015
4,2018-05-25 13:55:04,i didn’t rate it 5 stars because of a “glitch” were you can’t see your profile pic and/or get the daily gift i tried checking my internet to see if that was the problem but it wasn’t i could still play online levels and tried other apps that also used internet but they work fine other than that really good game worth the money :P,Really good game
5,2019-06-03 02:09:19,This is an amazing game but I would recommend get the lite version first just to see if you like it because it can be quite rage inducing. However it’s a great game that doesn’t slow my iPhone 5s down any so it great to just have on your phone and just play whenever you want. Reasonable price for everything you get.,Reasonable Price
5,2019-03-19 14:20:51,"I’m pretty sure everyone at some point has had this game on their phone, and I don’t blame them. Geometry Dash is one of those games that you will always come back too.

4,2023-10-31 22:49:35,I just bought this game for two dollars because I loved Geometry Dash lite so much but why didn’t they give them a five star you ask well here’s why because when I download this game it just crashes as soon as I get in I just paid two dollars for crap I love this game so much but what’s making it so bad is that I can’t even play it  To:robtop From:Dom👍,Help pls
5,2017-03-12 05:57:26,This update is amazing because now we can have daily levels new stuff inside the level bit the most thing that I love so much is that now I am really pro not to much I'm getting new record on the extreme level but the faces of the extreme level are cool and the store was not bad idea you know to bay icon color and those stuff,👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 good
3,2017-02-15 02:45:11,"Remove Scarlet Surge from the Chaos Gauntlet. The last time the level was updated was two years ago. It's out of date, annoying, buggy, and poorly made to the point where you die in the most unnecessary parts of the level when you do the correct thing.

5,2017-01-21 23:26:29,"Yes I know 2.1 was a LOOONG awaited update but it brought some bugs while also fixing bugs the main bug are the servers profiles and leaderboards aren't loading, levels aren't loading, daily rewards, levels, and quests aren't loading,etc just please fix these and everyone can enjoy if they weren't already :)",2.1
4,2023-09-24 00:21:21,"Geometry dash is now more broken than ever, every time when you try and load it; it crashes.

Since most of the geometry dash players are all on mobile",Geometry dash needs the 2.2 update
1,2023-10-29 15:54:30,"Used to be one of my favorite games spanning over many generations. But sadly, with iOS 17 public or beta, you absolutely can NOT download and play this game, because it just keeps constantly crashing. Will never understand what went wrong, but judging by the developers, they don’t tend to respond to well to these, also; since I paid your game RobTop, and it won’t let me play it, I suggest you find a way to refund me $2 for lost wasted time, effort, and long night trying to stay up to complete levels.",Can’t play
5,2023-10-04 23:52:26,"It’s an easy five star, nothing really much, but one thing, why do we have to manually save and load progress, why not do like Roblox did, one account can access everything you did on other devices, other than that, everything is fine",Fun :)

1,2023-08-09 16:47:19,As soon as I went into this app it shows the creators (Robtop games) and then it just kicks me out as if I pressed the home button!

5,2023-05-24 20:53:33,This game has a ton of levels and custom levels and is very fun but I have 1 complaint. Why do you have to verify levels if your gonna put them on auto anyway???

1,2021-06-08 03:56:13,Tapping and the perfect time is crucial while playing this game and this game has bugs where it just will keep going and the tapping doesn’t work and then I will die. This keeps happening and I’m playing on my brand new iPhone 12 mini so I know it’s not a touch screen issue because my phone is new and it doesn’t have touch screen issues with other games. Anyways I love the game except for that small thing but kinda ends up being a big thing in the game.,Needs to have bugs fixed
4,2020-03-08 23:34:04,I can’t say when the last update was made. I played the game like 2 years ago and deleted it and the night of the super bowl I downloaded it again and there was no new content just the same game!! Other than that it is a solid game!!

3,2020-12-26 23:06:37,I love geometry dash and I have always loved it. I used to play it on my iPhone SE but when I switched to my 6S it wouldn’t let me accept rewards. Today I made an attempt to fix this by deleting the app then signing into my account. When I tried to get my data back it said there was an issue and now I have lost all of my progress. If the developers see this (which they likely won’t) I beg of you to fix this issue!,Game has some issues :(
5,2020-09-06 21:15:33,It says it’s invalid and it’s not letting me write comments.

There are new features, icons, levels, etc. But one drawback: If your screen is not that big and you are trying high object levels, then sometimes it won’t work. It will lose some data and it will take you to the home page.",GD
5,2019-06-23 16:06:10,"This is a glitch many of us found, whenever you upload a level and delete it and they go to “my levels” and they try to delete it from the server but they can’t. If you can fix that in 2.2 then that would be helpful. Still a fun game!",When will this be fixed?
4,2017-10-22 01:27:05,"This game is really good, with only few bugs. It is not for people that don't have that great reflexes though! It has a lot of things you can work on, like demons and stuff, but just repetitively doing the same thing over and over again, isn't so fun. So geometry dash needs to have other stuff like multiplayer, and etc. . Also it's hard to make a level... Good game.",Needs more stuff
3,2018-09-22 19:52:33,"I am a creator. When I play this game I think it’s awsome. But, when I play sub zero, there are things in a free version of this game that aren’t in the full version. Example, in the levels, it zooms in and out. In power trip, you reverse I. A weird way. I want it in the game. Once you play all the main levels in practice, you’ve seen it all.

5,2017-10-07 14:06:39,This is my favorite game to play on my phone. I love how even though it is a 2 dimensional you are able to make it look 3 dimensional. I really enjoy the music and most of all I love that the game is not pay to win. I think it is great that it is not a pay to win game so you have to earn everything legit and have skill to progress in the game. A great game 👍👍✌️👍👍,Great Game
5,2017-08-18 03:41:06,I love the levels and songs. Better yet here's no ads and I get no lag and there's no bugs. So many secrets and it's very interactive.

I love it!!!!!,Amazing!!!
5,2017-05-13 21:19:44,There was a weird glitch I found but it does not affect anything and I think it is pretty funny. When I opened the 4hr small chest I got a key and I looked at the key counter when you get it in the Main Menu and it said -1 and then went to 0. I then went to the treasure room to unlock a chest and it was there as 1 key. It's pretty funny. 😂😜,Weird Glitch
5,2017-03-26 15:50:19,Geonetry dash it's an awesome game the best I have ever played in my phone but robtop there are many bugs that came in with the 2.1 for example that the time for the daily and hourly chests freezes and sometimes I'm connected to internet and the level page won't open and that may be the servers but please hurry up and get the 2.11 done,Love it
5,2017-02-11 03:15:44,I love ur game but I was thinking of maybe an online market were players can put up there icons for a certain amount of diamonds or orbs or they can put it up for bid...

It has been like 2 years since the old review but this update is actually really fun. Wish I could rate more stars!,AMAZING
4,2023-10-22 17:59:23,"So a few days ago I was building a level. So today I decided to continue building the level. So when I opened up Geometry Dash, it immediately crashed, every time I opened the game up. And this happened every single time, I even restarted my phone too. So, please fix that problem in the game.","Really good, until today."
4,2023-02-11 00:53:42,I used to enjoy this game a lot back in the days when I was younger that’s why I decided to buy it to play it again. I was excited to play the game but as soon as I started playing my excitement was gone! Every time I touch the screen to jump it lags. This happens on every iPhone I hope this gets fixed.,Lag on iPhone
5,2023-10-17 13:51:54,i can’t believe 2.2 is right around the corner! if you see this robtop-  i just wanted to say that the community has been impatient! you have to work everyday BY YOURSELF to make this update! and the community just keeps asking for more and more features! WHAT DO THEY EXPECT!? anyways! thanks for making this awesome game!,AMAZING GAME!
5,2023-10-14 23:17:19,Don’t buy the game until it’s in 2.2 version which will bring a fix to the game problem and it will work soon in the next month so stay tuned for this new version of the game (overall the game is a 5/5 for me so just waiting to play it on ios 17 now),IOS 17 BUG
3,2023-09-30 19:37:58,I’m not trying to bring this game down or anything this is probably just my problem but I paid to play this game after playing Geometry Dash Lite (very fun game btw) and every time I click on this game on my phone it won’t open for some reason I’ve tried everything I could I searched it up and still nothing will work if anybody can help me pls do thank you,My game will not open
5,2023-06-24 00:16:03,Geometry Dash is a really fun game and the full version is better than the light because you can make games you can do all sorts of stuff that you can do in the light version of Geometry Dash. I’ve been creating my levels and I’ve been fun. You should try out Geometry Dash too,Geometry Dash is the best
5,2023-05-31 01:55:20,"I know you are going to make a 2.2 version and I am thinking that you already had made 2.2, be cause Iwatched that you already made one but if you didn’t add some two way controls because I think you have two way controls.   I am on mobile.  Henrry.",2.2

4,2022-10-11 01:30:23,I give this game 4 stars because I have a hard time nothing wrong with the game it’s just a personal thing over all the game is fun I recommend it but I does have a cost so if you just want to play the game they get the free one but if you want more things like creating levels or anything like thats get this one that’s my review,My Rating
5,2023-01-10 22:00:43,"I used to have lite, and it was already one of my favorite games to play, but when I got the full version, I cried with happiness. The idea to make your own levels is genius, and to look at one’s other people made. I would definitely recommend this game. 5/5 stars.",Amazing game

5,2022-09-07 10:33:37,I’m not sure if it’s just my phone but there’s a glitch where when I click on geometry dash it will show a very brief clip of the intro RobTop thing and then it’ll just close the app completely. It didn’t happen to geometry world so I’m assuming it’s just a main game thing? I don’t really know,Glitch

4,2022-06-04 23:53:37,Geometry dash is a amazing game but 2 problems why I gave the rating 4 stars problem 1 is that when I exit the game no music plays so I have to swipe up my app then go back in problem 2 is when I try to upload my level it always does not work so I want you to fix those issues please?,Great game but 2 problems
3,2022-05-31 15:28:53,"Okay, I don’t mean that Geometry Dash is bad. I played the free versions and LOVED them! The music and the levels are OP.

5,2022-05-30 23:23:26,If you have a newer system geometry dash won’t work for some reason older devices and systems are able to load the game all of you that say it keeps crashing and the game is bad your wrong you just need a older device get smarter people,You are all wrong

5,2022-01-24 02:31:19,You should add a speed up or slow down version for the full version where as I said you can speed it up and or slow it down.  The percentage bar can be a different color depending on if you beat the level slower or faster.,Casual
4,2020-09-07 20:00:07,"I know this isn’t considered a mobile game anymore, but it originated on mobile. The thting that makes it 4 stars is the fact that 2.2 is taking wayyyy too long to come out. And also the fact how PC players have an adavantage when it comes to straight flying. But other than that, this is a pretty cool game! I had it since 2.0.",Best mobile game ever

5,2020-06-28 03:39:24,This game is awesome there is nothing I would change about this game other than one thing I just think that they should make the amount of coins to unlock the other levels are to high clubsteps amount is reasonable but the other 2 in my opinion aren’t but other than that great game awesome graphics five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,The best game

I really hope 2.2 is in the near future but I will continue to play regardless. Love this app and the community behind it. :)",Played for so many years...
5,2021-03-22 18:01:39,"I’ve completed every level in GD except the demons, this game is pretty fun but my favorite feature is Creator Mode! I wouldn’t like this game half as much with out Creator Mode, it makes you look forward to things you can make everyday and 2.2 is coming as we speak!  Also the stories and gauntlets provide a satisfying challenge that isn’t too hard.. (maybe except the blue key 😅) Also the Map Packs give you something to do by various creators featured by RopTop, I like this game because it focuses on the community making the game itself a lot better! RobTop already said 2.3 was gonna have community votes!  Love, Monster",This Game Is Amazing
5,2021-03-08 20:30:11,"A cool game! This game, you don’t have random ads in it, and you also don’t need to watch ads to get anything. You have to earn it.  I’m currently stuck on Clutterfunk, but I beat the other levels before it with all the coins.  I also beat Fingerdash, which was surprisingly easy.  The game is fun, and a good way to blow off some time. It is a riddle-like game, where you have to discover some secrets to complete it.   It is also a game you can play without internet or whatever (but not the online levels).   In conclusion, it is a well functioned game that you can play basically whenever, and really enjoyable.  Thank you.",I like it
5,2021-02-06 18:06:56,"Infinite thanks to RobTop for making this game. There’s just one tiny problem: when a notification comes up, the sound and pulse completely shut down. My recommendation is that you change all the sounds and remove any possible audio errors.",I LOVE IT
4,2020-08-03 00:03:16,I really love the game but the reason I rate 4 stars is because when I was creating a level I pressed 2 buttons that ruins my entire level the alingy or alinx buttons I don’t really know what they are called but the messed up everything and I had to delete my entire level and had to rebuild it. I think those buttons should be removed,The two buttons
5,2021-01-27 16:17:44,I really appreciate how much hard work goes into the levels and design that makes it harder as you go on and when ever you complete the level you feel a wave of accomplishment and happiness due to the time you spend into the level all I have to give is a five star review.,Hard Levels
5,2020-12-29 03:58:19,This is a great game and I play it a lot and I just thought of some ideas for 2.2 while playing. 1.friending people. It would be amazing if you could friend your friends on 2.2  2.It would also be amazing if you made it where we could make levels together with friends online,Some Ideas for 2.2
3,2020-11-15 02:36:39,"The game overall isn’t bad, it’s actually really good and addicting, however that’s mainly because of the people who create levels on there. The levels made by the devs are buggy. For example I was playing deadlocked and kept getting stuck on 38% cause I kept dying when going through the portal for no reason, honestly the devs should hand the game over to the mods cause they know how to create good content and balanced gameplay",Mediocre
5,2020-10-02 19:15:40,There is problem with my game i have full internet and all that but every time i open a chest it stops mid opening and says an error occurred and then when i press the X the game makes me wait 3 or 24 hours just for the the same thing to happen its a great game and all but please fix this,Problem
4,2017-04-04 16:56:55,"This game is one of my personal favorites. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I am having trouble making a RobTop account, and last time I deleted the game I lost all my progress and my old registered account. If account issues could be fixed, this game would be 100% the best app on my phone. Great new updates with 2.0 and 2.1; Geometry Dash is a must-try!",Awesome game
5,2020-03-18 16:19:55,"I’ve been working on a level for a year and it’s finished! I’ve beaten a few levels as well. And if you are gonna complain that 2.2 isn’t out or there are bugs in the game, there is only one person developing all of the codes and such, he is trying his hardest to get this game to work. So please, respect the guy.",Love this game!
5,2020-02-10 13:14:46,"Gd is a great game! I play on iPad, so if I use a black orb with a spider it might make the spider go up on fingerdash. Even if I try to tap the black orb and let go as quick as I can, it still happens. I still like this game a lot! But gg got 79% on fingerdash. The bug is at 44% or 45% in the spider. Just letting you know to try to fix the bug. Still love you robtop!",Fingerdash bug on iPad
5,2020-01-25 16:53:15,"I have had a lot of fun with the full version of geometry dash! I originally had geometry dash lite, and I had so much fun with it, but then, I found out you could build your own geometry dash LEVELS! Then I realized that I wanted the full version, so I looked at it, bought it, and I love it. This game is amazing! If you don’t have it, you should get it.",This game is so fun!
5,2019-07-27 18:26:00,This game has been around for a while yet still is fun. One thing is I can’t upload any levels with a message saying “upload failed. Please try again later” however it has never fixed. Kinda takes out the fun when you make a level but can’t share it,Great game
5,2019-06-04 16:34:18,"I have been playing this game for about five years now. Whenever I’m bored of any other game I’m playing, this is my go to. It sticks with you and it’s so addictive. I would like to see more content within the next year or so including levels, skins, etc. Overall, great game and keep up the good work!",Stayed With Me Forever!
5,2019-05-03 00:37:13,"Geometry Dash is a very fun and addictive game where you can be creative and play fun levels that other people create not to mention the official levels like Back On Track, Clutterfunk, Theory of Everything 2, Clubstep. Btw there are 3 levels unlocked by something called secret coins: Theory of Everything 2(20 coins) Deadlocked (30 coins) and Clubstep (10 coins)",Geometry Dash
5,2019-04-16 02:49:33,"Best game over in my opinion even better than Fortnite! ( I don’t play it, i have once or twice.) Love the game I have one thing... can you please let there be a option were you can look at your level that you make and see all of the comments all all of that stuff easier. Thanks for making this game RobTop  -Drewfus",BEST GAME OVER!
5,2019-04-06 11:39:16,"This game is so fun and amazing. The soundtracks just make me dance. The problems are that it takes so much data on my IPad that all the other apps are slow. But who cares about that when you can have endless fun with people posting new levels every day, building your own levels and grinding through the original ones? ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!",LOVE IT TO NEPTUNE!
5,2018-11-23 22:07:13,I love this so much. You shroud where you can spectate people while they are playing the level or something. Or make a multiplayer mode where you have four people and they are on one level. When they start and whenever they die the person with the highest percentage on that level wins.,Best game in the world
5,2018-06-10 02:26:07,"Simple and fun game. Just difficult enough to keep you coming back for another try, time after time. Wicked soundtracks and a rhythm element to the jumps adds to the fun, although this aspect is spoiled by the fact that sometimes the jump timing is not in sync with the rhythm of the music, which can throw you off.",Horribly addictive
5,2018-03-05 01:59:02,"I absolutely love this game but some levels can be really hard so I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge. Also something I like about this  is that you can create your own levels and share them with others which makes it super fun. So anyone who likes a fast, fun geometry game MAKE SURE TO GET THIS!",Hard but fun!
5,2018-01-31 23:09:03,"Geometry dash is testing your skills and attention, it helps you see things from a different point of view and makes you put down the right amount of pressure throughout the whole game to win! It definitely makes you understand more and be more careful, it is a 5 star game!",Awesome and educational!
5,2017-05-12 12:22:14,"I started playing Geometry Dash when my sister showed me the game and I haven't stopped playing since. The only problem I have is that sometimes the online services only work at certain times a day. Everything else is perfect, but it's just this small detail I would like fixed.",I love this game!
5,2017-03-21 20:54:19,"I ❤️ this amazing game because    of it's graphics, you can make your own levels, and because of it's awesome music. The reason that I got the game is because the free version was boring and short, so I just got the full version. It is amazing and I recommend this game if you like to be mad and have fun at the same time!!!",One of the best games ever!!!
4,2017-01-26 04:47:50,"I love this game and 2.1 is revolutionary! But since the new amazing update, not a single online feature will load for me except for the featured and level search. No gauntlets, scoreboards, my profile, or anything. Can you fix it RubRub? I'm really sorry we all ask you of so much. I really appreciate your work and I love your game.

3,2023-11-10 20:50:46,I am not very happy with the new IOS update as it removed the ability to play the game and I was thinking that you could maybe even just add a one detail update to bring it back or something as for all the mobile players are going to have to get back all of that data that was stored and possibly quit the game bringing in barely any income. Thanks robtop  P.S. 2.2 when?,Fix for IOS 17
5,2023-10-10 01:48:15,"Robtop, this is an amazing game, and i know because i play it on Steam in my computer.

5,2023-10-06 16:57:31,I updated my phone to iOS 17 and the geometry dash keeps crashing look up five videos and did not fix it. This game was great old but gold but I can’t play and neither can some other people. Hope this review gets some where,Game is broken
4,2023-07-28 12:08:03,"Even though some may rate this bad for how hard it is, I would disagree as the fast paced movement and reverse gravity sections of the game makes you have to think about what you need to do and when, as a single tap could mess up the entire course. The art style is very clean and retro, I love it. Overall I would rate it 4 stars.",Very good and fast pace
1,2023-08-09 01:48:36,"Bruh, the game doesn’t even load. It just kicks me straight out on iPad. And it was free here. There is nothing I can do except contact. If you will fix this bug WHERE YOU CANT GET ON WITH HOME BUTTON DEVICES…. it will be fine and I will change my mind. Also when are your updating GD lite, subzero, meltdown, and world? Cause they are getting quite boring. And and a Geomerty dash Breeze. Levels Over The Clouds, Into The Zone, Ghost Ship, and Bitsplosion. You can’t just update the main game when ain’t people can’t get on it also add 2.2 this month.",NOT WORKING
4,2023-06-29 02:59:35,"The game has been around for forever, and will always hold a special place in my heart. I re downloaded it for nostalgia and boredom relief for a recent flight.

5,2020-08-10 18:14:02,I like this game but the only problem is that Some good levels never got star rated. RobTop only rates levels made by popular creators. And he rates autos normal. I hope this problem will stop.  He also didn’t release 2.2! I would like to get featured. Alright. Where’s 2.2?,The problem with the game
5,2020-07-25 22:44:18,I love this game because it’s so fun it’s a classic and it’s actually a challenging game for once. Sure it will make you rage but then you can just try again. And you can even make your own level overall great and nostalgic game. God bless all who see this. Jesus us loves you,Great game and also very challenging 😊

5,2019-12-29 23:25:31,"This game is nearly perfect, but I have a few issues. First, you should be able to have a collab option in an editor, so multiple people can work on something at a time. Also, when you sync you data, you get a ton of copies of your levels, and it’s annoying.",Great Game
5,2019-11-27 20:09:28,I love this game it’s so fun to play. I like making levels in the game and I just found out how to get cool portals. It’s a neat game and I almost have all the skin colors.

5,2019-10-20 17:25:22,This is the only game you will ever need. There is always something to do such as beat the normal levels then search up some hard Demond's and try to beat those.

5,2019-07-13 16:57:07,I have now go this game on two accounts and it is so worth the money. You can play it anywhere because you don’t need internet for it and it also has levels for all kind of skill considering all of the online levels.

5,2022-04-04 22:10:55,"I don’t understand people who rated this lower than five stars. This is an awesome game because it is basically run by the community, so there are always new levels to try.  Oh yeah, and by the way, I saw this video of a five year old raging and breaking his iPad over dying on stereo madness. Come on, it’s just stereo madness.",Epic

5,2021-06-11 21:55:45,"Very fun, only slightly laggy but that’s because I’m on an iPhone 6 that has been heavily used. One glitch is when you go into a different application then back into geometry dash without having completely swiped out of it the sound won’t play",Amazing game
5,2020-09-10 01:34:54,"I absolutely love Geometry Dash, but I am confused why they haven’t updated it yet... My guess is that they are working really hard on this next update, since we have been waiting for more than 2 years. So fingers crossed for this next update to come soon!",It’s good but...
5,2020-07-09 17:45:57,"I feel like Waterflame created this because of his music, anyway, when I was younger my cousin used to play this game, when I got older I decided to ask my big cousin what was that game called. I practiced and I CREATED MY GAMES! Thank you so much! but the problem is that I cannot  replay :( THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾👍👍👍👍👍 P.S I Mobile is easier",I love this game so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
5,2020-07-02 00:52:46,I love it the two dollars are worth it! But the one thing I don’t like is you have to get a certain amount of coins to get the demon rated levels and it’s not easy to get pins to some people and I’m one of them well if you are not sure if you want this game you will regret not getting it five stars great game!,I’m blown away!
4,2019-06-22 18:08:46,"This game is really fun! The reason why I am rating it four stars is because it gets kind of boring after a while. I think you should make levels more epic and more hard. That way, it’ll be funner. I also think you should add more MONSTERS. That’s the fun part of the game. The vaults, the monster, the paradise, the monster challenges, and RubRub. :) You can add a lot to this game to make it better.",Fun-Fun-Fun!
5,2020-05-25 06:55:59,I think that the game has a so much fun even though I can’t beat some levels but you just need to work hard try to get more colors and skins make maps for you and other people to play and try hard to complete the levels and aventully you will and most importantly have fun. 😸😺😓,😍😘🥰
5,2020-03-21 05:05:32,This game is very very good and fun although it’s very difficult it is amazing the only thing I would change is make the levels a little less difficult and have more updates sooner thanks for this amazing game,Good game extremely fun but lack of updates
5,2020-03-18 18:05:59,"I love Geometry Dash, I’ve been playing it since it came out. But I just recently got the new iPad Pro (with no home button), and I noticed that it isn’t correctly optimized. So I was just wondering if the next time you release an update, you could add optimization for the iPad Pro?",Optimization?
5,2020-03-16 20:43:03,"3 new levels with the subzero features, and reverse orbs, and random triggers. Also introduce the 4x speed and positioning orb into official levels, and make a triple-form portals (recommended use in demons). And a black pad if ok.  Also, make the rating system 15 stars. 1= auto 2-3= easy 4-5=hard 6-7=harder 7-10 insane 11 easy demos 12 medium demon 13 hard demon 14 insane demon and 15 extreme demom Another idea is to incorporate all those fanmade ideas by alias and the 2P mode into official levels. Achievement idea: fuuuuuuuuuuuu- crash at over 95% after having all 3 coins FuuuuUUUuUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUc- previous achievement but with levels over 12 stars",Great game but here are 2.2 ideas
5,2020-01-03 19:51:35,"This app is AMZING! And I totally recommend buying it! The only problem for though is that it won’t let me make a account... whenever I put in my email it says my email doesn’t exist! (I even tried my moms email..) but that’s only happening to me. I just want it fixed. Other than that, BUY THIS GAME!",Love it but problem
5,2019-07-22 01:28:05,I have loved this game for so long. It is a simple tactic that should have its very own category. Memory and timing. It is a fun little mini game that a normal company wouldn’t get a five star. But this company took that idea and made a whole new idea off of it. It can get annoying sometimes but a game would be boring without that.,Simply awesome
4,2018-06-15 12:24:02,"The main levels can be hard at times but are really fun, I just think the transition from jumper to time machine is hard. And the level editor is extremely fun, but I can’t find some stuff that other people have used in their levels, Idk if I have to unlock the items or what. But all in all the game is really fun. 👍","Nice game, but I would like a few things"
3,2019-04-20 18:02:51,I enjoy this game a lot but it is so buggy especially on phone so it makes it really annoying.  The dual ship is glitched and the upside down one always crashes for me making it near impossible to beat levels with dual ships. The rating system is also kinda messed up as some levels are rated much easier than they are or much harder. I like the game but it really needs an update,Could be better
5,2018-06-27 18:29:26,"My name is Redstoneguy500 and I found a problem in the editor room. When my character moves to the right, the screen does not follow the character. Besides that, I like the game! But, I want you to add multiplayer mode, weekly demon, and less bugs. Thanks for reading and hopefully you will add some of those into the game :)",Awesome game!
4,2017-04-11 05:22:01,"Fun game - levels are very difficult at first, but with practice mode (and even without) they become much more doable over time. I never get too frustrated because I improve a little bit every time I play each level, even the most challenging. And I like the variety of gameplay over The Impossible Game (which this game has mostly copied.)",Very addictive
5,2018-03-13 04:15:58,"This game is so much fun, even though it may be a little frustrating from time to time. With the full version, there are many secrets that you can find, and trust me, they're worth your time. The secrets add a whole new level to the game, and makes you want to look harder in every area you can reach.",My FAVORITE game!
5,2018-02-07 13:18:04,"So... I heard that a video said you can become a moderator by one of these two things: *Thumbs Up a level to get the achievement Helper, then click whatever that icon says ‘Failed’. You will be a Helper. OR *Tell RobTop that you can become a moderator. At 1st he may say no, but if you keep typing ‘please’, he will say ‘Ok fine’. Or he will just say no.  Due to that, some people want moderator, but the rest of us GDashers don’t.  Anyways, if you had to play this game... It may not be educational. WRONG! It’s educational. It’s geometry. You’re going to try it if you’re interested in educational games.",5 Stars! Better than any other game. (Re-Edited)
5,2017-09-11 18:22:21,"Perfect game for those who want good music coursing through their veins. I personally think the game is awesome. The game has been a great app. I wish that even more levels could be made for more music. I would like a way to message and send out cool emojis from the app when you get a new avatar. Other than that, I love the game! Five stars!!",Dude Great
4,2023-10-21 05:31:38,"The game is awesome good job Robtop But there’s just one thing that really bugs me , why when i try to launch geometry dash why does it always crash it shows the first creators name screen and then it exits me out it only stays on that and then it closes does anyone know why is this happening if you do let me know",Just one issue
5,2023-10-28 16:13:21,So there’s a bug in geometry dash for iphone that makes it to where every time you try to go on it it immediately crashes and kicks you out so can you please fix this? But overall geometry dash is a really fun game,5 stars but theres a bug
5,2023-10-22 23:39:55,This is my favorite game and I looked at when it was last updated and that means 2.2 will have a ton of content. But after I updated my iPad to 17.0 it could not open and I at all and I hope it gets updated real soon. Also 2.2 is soon.,Great game🌟
4,2023-10-18 10:52:49,I love this game so much. I’ve been playing it since I was 5. There has been no problems at all with the game until two weeks ago. Every time I play and I get a notification it always slows down the game. Sometimes it happens when nothing even happens and it gets really annoying,.
5,2023-10-18 15:42:18,"If you have an error while opening Geometry Dash, no worries. Apparently it is due to the game not being updated for such a long time (7 years). I hope it’ll start working again after the update (October 2023).",For the others

4,2022-09-19 17:22:11,The issue is that a lot of iPhone users ( appears to be home button iPhones ) are no longer even able to access the game because it immediately kicks you out of it. If you could fix this that would be great,Great game. However there is an issue.
5,2023-10-09 15:03:43,"I love this game, it is so fun to play levels made by others and be able to make your own! Sometimes when you try to create an account though, it can say your email is invalid (when it’s not). But, it is still a five-star game.",Amazing

5,2022-07-04 08:29:55,Many people have been saying the glitch about geometry dash is stuck in 2.1 there are 2 things this might won’t let u in 2.2… 1st reason: probably don’t have a account. 2nd reason: a bug in the system,One small problem

When I googled it I discovered that the game will not work on later iOS devices that have a home button, which his device does.

Would like to see mabey a custom wave or ship skins I think that would be a great addition! Other wise an excellent game!!!",Best game ever
5,2020-08-12 17:57:30,I was thinking you could make a level that needs 50 coins to unlock and what it is all the lvls combined Into one 2. I was also thinking that you could add a full version of subzero and meltdown so that there are full versions of the levels in it,New levels and other things
5,2020-07-15 17:45:53,"Honestly, this is definitely my favourite game. It’s so fun but can make you mad. If you have anger issues, I do not recommend.

4,2017-12-28 17:48:59,"This game is quite good, even now. Community needs some work as always but hopefully with the 2.2 update it will introduce some more better aspects of the community.

It's worth a shot people.","Quality game, diminished after the 2.0 update though."
5,2020-07-06 01:53:20,"I’m thinking of a new enemy like the animated ones and a orb that is white that will change your character into a different one like a spider,ball,wave,and robot and wave and stuff and as for the new animated enemy I want a shark personally or a new character like a scorpion that can jump twice as more than the cube and has a double jump!!!",NEW IDEAS
5,2019-10-13 13:56:30,I’ve been playing for almost a year and it’s an amazing experience. All the great levels and custom levels really release my inner creativity.

5,2019-07-09 20:48:27,This game is fantastic time killer and also just fun. I still don’t understand why it’s so much fun but it is and it’ll get you to the point where you slamming your finger into your phone because you continue to mess up on things you know you can do. Be prepared to rage. You have been warned.,Game review
1,2019-03-18 23:50:20,"As we all know, Robtop takes his time to release an update. The thing that annoys me the most is I’ve played this game on several devices, latest one was an iPhone 8 and the game is going smooth and fine, but from the middle of nowhere the buildings start moving like lagging, like 40fps instead of 60fps and it’s been the same issue since I started playing 3 or 4 years ago. How long is it gonna take for Robtop to do something about it? Even tapping becomes delayed thank to this issue. Annoying.",Never will be fixed.

4,2018-08-22 01:52:57,This game is great and is very fun and a great way to get spacial awareness I gave this a 4 star review because it’s only a great game not the best game ever created because some of the levels say demon and when I play it it’s a 2 second long level with no obstacles and it’s people just trying to get free stars and people might like this but I don’t so overall it’s a great game but not the best,I love this game
5,2018-12-28 07:29:06,Geometry Dash is a real fun and enjoyable game. Even though it has a simple concept in some ways it is still made the most fun it can be by helping with the rhythm of the music and with many other functions like allowing the player to create his/her own level.,good and original
5,2018-09-04 13:48:12,"Geometry dash is fun and old but the practice mode song can be annoying because it isn’t the same song as the level you are playing but other than that, this game is so fun and so addictive!!!!

4,2017-12-09 20:32:24,This game has so much content that I can't even fit it into this review because I want to play this game some more also it is hard.

It’s not like there’s no 2.2 the last time I deleted the app I got it again because I love this great gameplay but I couldn’t update the app. I know you’re working on a new app called boomlings because I saw the tariller for it  and there is a lot of bugs. I hope it comes out soon😀,2.2
5,2018-08-12 04:56:22,When I first saw this game I was like “this is so stupid” but then I played it and it has been so addicting...deadlocked is my favorite level and I have already beat it and TOE2 is amazing as well but I can’t beat clubstep yet...this game also has online levels that you can search for so I reall think that EVERYBODY should get this game👍🏻,THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTING
1,2018-06-16 12:35:56,"I downloaded this game for my 6 year old and he started using bad language. Our family does not use bad language. I asked him where he learned those words and he said “Geometry Dash.” What?? This game says its for 4+. There is bad language in the background songs and written on the screen in downloadable levels. What???? Thanks a lot for the warning, Geometry Dash. Now I get to deal with a crying child who no longer gets to play the game and break him of the new words he learned on a game that we made sure was age appropriate. This is NOT OK!!!!!!",Bad Language!!! (4+?????)
1,2018-05-21 22:30:39,"This is the best platformer on mobile by far. You may be wondering why I’m writing a bad review. Well, if updated and gameplay changes matter to you, DON’T BUY THIS GAME! If you’re okay with a year between updates, then get this game! I love this game, but the last update came out in late 2016 and to me that’s unexepytable. Robtop, if your reading this, I love this game, but for me to keep playing I need more change and I’m sad I’m writing a bad review. P.S. this is my first review and I’ve sinked 1000 hours in this game, so I know what I’m talking about....",This is my favorite game but...
5,2018-02-10 22:16:15,"this is my favorite app ever and I haven't gone more than a day without it! It's endless and there aren't any ads. But for some strange reason, my recording doesn't work or it records at random times. I really want to share my levels with friends and the community but I can't. Can you fix this please?",LOVEE IT
5,2017-12-26 18:45:35,"It’s extremely fun but it might make you rage a lot. The price is definitely worth it, because there are endless possibilities. Just one thing though, I wish they would add all the Geometry Dash World levels, Geometry Dash Meltdown levels, and the Geometry Dash Subzero levels into the original one which is this one.",.
4,2017-04-13 03:58:17,"Geometry Dash is by far one of the most entertaining mobile games. but, I have been having a problem recently where I can no longer download custom songs. Instead, it says ""failed to fetch song info"" as soon as I try download it. Fix please. Other than that, no bugs or glitches.","Good Game, but a couple of problems..."
5,2017-06-29 23:39:00,"This is a really great game and there are tons of levels to keep you busy. I recommend getting the full game because you can play online, play other people's levels and unlock new levels, I also recommend getting geometry dash world and geometry dash meltdown both are really fun!",Very good game
5,2017-05-23 02:01:56,"This game is AWESOME. Just putting that out there, and everyone who is just LOOKING for tiny flaws is just- I don't even... The level editor works super smoothly, and the main and custom levels are usually pretty hard, leaving you raging but always coming back for more. It's a new flappy bird, just better. Great job RobTop. 😀",AMAZING! Great job RobTop!
4,2017-01-31 22:28:28,"Amazing game. I've been here since 1.6 and it just keeps getting better I absolutely love it. But I have a certain problem... the lost gauntlets don't work for me. Even if I have good internet it just says ""something went wrong"" and i have tried deleting and reinstalling the game but it just doesn't work... hope this gets fixed soon!",Amazing
5,2017-03-26 00:08:28,"This game is awesome! There is a level editor and there are no in-app purchases! It was worth the money. (It's cheap) The game is hard but, there is practice mode to make it easier. Plus, when you beat a level (not a level editor level😕) you will get a skin or a new color! I suggest you get it!",So cool! 😀
5,2017-03-02 02:47:31,"Definitely worth the money extremely addicting, I've been playing this game almost since the day it came out. It has endless possibilities with the user created levels. Best thing is once you download the online levels you can play them offline",Awesome
5,2017-01-29 06:08:58,So I've been waiting for 2.1 for so long and in my mind it lived up to the hype except for one thing: on my phone the lost gauntlets don't work and that's a problem for me trying to unlock all the keys. Am I the only one who is having this problem?,I love 2.1 but it could use some changes
5,2023-11-11 20:08:00,This is an amazing game but recently started crashing immediately after booting it up and i have tried everything to get it to work and i check every day but it just kinda broke hope it can be fixed,Game wont run

5,2023-06-09 19:17:56,If your getting this game it is to hard for beginners and I think they should make an easier level electrodynamix is also insanely hard so I think they should at least make it shorter but overall love the game great work :),Geometry dash

5,2022-10-10 20:00:25,I am pretty new to the game have completed the first few levels and I honestly think Dry Out and Base after Base should be switched around as difficulties. I think Dry Out is harder. To show this my current percentage on Dry Out is 51% and Base After Base 77%. Overall great game!,Love it! But one suggestion!

Every Geometry Dash user will see and play it.  2. Can create a profile. You can comment on levels, chat with other users, and even receive more prizes.  3. Can play the main levels. These are included in the game.  I played the free version of this game and I got decently good at it because I liked it.  You did it again, RubRub. =)",Awesome!!

1,2023-07-21 10:22:44,Just bought this for my son and I didn’t know there was an issue with the game crashing on the latest iOS version. This game is unplayable if you’re running iOS 15+.

And many levels are hard and kind of turn this into a rage game.",Not as good as I thought
4,2021-01-16 04:05:05,So I’ve been playing this game for a good while now and when ever I’m in a level I ALWAYS notice those times where I tap and the game just doesn’t register that I tapped and I loose. I’m at the point that it’s just a common thing and it’s getting really annoying. I’d this just very bad timing or a glitch that’s very annoying?,Glich or Just really bad luck?

It should be the first level on the list.",YESSS!!!
5,2020-01-01 06:30:48,Probably my favorite game but I have waited for over 2 years for update 2.2.

Good lord, the is SO many bad things about it that I bet ya I could make a SONG about it! The levels a HORRIBLE 🤮. The levels don't match the theme (like, at all).

5,2020-07-03 03:50:47,I love the game have played it a bunch but I think you should add controller support besides that the levels are great the community makes awesome levels and I love the fact that you  can create your own levels tho it's a bit hard to do at first.,Amazing game just one suggestion

I researched how to fix the problem and it’s because the game hasn’t been updated for a while, can you please fix this so I can keep playing geometry dash,  Thank you.",IOS 17
5,2019-03-10 23:42:44,Ok I like this game but it’s kind of bad because there are so many map packs and there are 17 demon packs like what was robtop thinking? Anyway I really don’t understand the commands in creator I only know how to change the background but it goes back to the same color in 3 blocks :( so robtob please improve that.,Not so good
5,2019-02-08 23:13:59,Im a type of person who hates to waste money on games. One of my friend and I played the game but I didnt have the full version. I beaten the game levels and got tired off it. My friend told me to buy the game but I refused. Until one day I decided to buy it. The game is super fun and it defenetly worth it. You should get it!!,Geomatry dash
5,2018-08-24 21:57:15,This game is absolutely fabulous! I could play for hours upon hours without getting bored. It pushes my skills (and that’s very little) to the limit. This game has gotten me to get better at memorization and reactions. Thanks RobTop! I’ve beaten 2 demons in less than an hour (demon mix and Xstep v2) so now I know I’ve wasted my life. WORTH IT!!!,Yep
5,2018-08-10 20:53:49,If I had to choose between all my games or this game I would choose this game. It’s really hard but I like it that way and I would play this all day.i have a suggestion please and more levels because all of them are amazing. Thanks if you do as I said,Hard but amazing
5,2018-07-08 15:31:23,"Ok ok guys, this has to be the most entertaining and awesome game ever! Besides the normal levels to complete, the big thing about it is custom levels!

5,2022-08-19 19:43:48,So for 2.2 I think there should be a new game mode called the dragon where you can destroy blocks2 maybe a new level called blast processing 2 a demon the song is blast processing but is played on piano it includes the swingcopter ship cube ufo wave robot,Ideas for 2.2
5,2022-07-16 05:09:25,This game is really fun to play they have more stuff to do than the filmiest one you can create levels and do many more and you could put your saved audios and many more i recommend this game to any new players,Geometry dash

5,2021-06-27 02:17:57,"I gotta say, after playing this for 4 years, I can’t believe I have never rate it. It’s an amazing game, and Robert himself ( dev of game ) has been interacting with the community recently on his discord. Not only is he a developer, but an amazing and awesome dude. Shoutouts to him for making this game :)  Sincerely            Felix1594 :P",GD Review
5,2021-06-20 19:03:04,"I think it’s a very good game that costs the size of a Hershey’s bar. You can do so much and it’s endless amount of possibilities like, online levels, official levels, create and more! I hope this review helps people get into the game trust me it’s awesome",My opinion

5,2020-10-30 18:11:08,It is a great game I don’t think I will not quit. The levels are fun and the level creator keeps the game fresh. After buying there is no adds or micro transactions. Some levels keep me playing for weeks or even longer. The game is a instant mobile classic.,Best game on mobile
3,2020-09-18 20:13:46,Very complicated to just login  Updates take 3 years and aren’t even that good but the game is fun to play but when u spend months creating a amazing decorated level rob top doesn’t even rate it.        I would say with the 5 million dollars he has he should hire some other people to work for him so ya I wouldn’t really recommend this game but when u play the levels it’s very fun and entertaining,Ok
5,2020-06-09 17:12:52,I know that there is a free version of this game but this version is definitely worth buying. It has way more levels than the free version and you can create and download even more! There is a shop where you can buy skins and trails too! This is the best game I’ve ever played!,AMAZING
5,2020-03-25 00:12:31,"So, first things off, I love the game and it has a special place in my heart. Now what I want from this game(on mobile) is for mobile players to play on a controller(DualShock 4, Xbox one, etc.). It would make the game much more spot on and more easier to control. That’s my suggestion, RubRub.",Just an idea
5,2020-03-08 20:49:42,It’s a fun mobile game while it makes you rage it’s still very fun and feels rewarding to beat a level one of the best parts would be creating your own levels and playing other user created levels for an extra challenge,Overall it’s fun
5,2019-12-30 01:18:35,"This game is one of the best games to have on mobile or anywhere in my opinion, it is fun and tricky but addicting and it keeps you occupied with all the features it has to offer.   10/10 would recommend   “Soon” ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",One of the original gems

My favorite is “Theory of Everything”","Great game, but very hard"
4,2017-05-25 05:09:28,"Fun to play and design levels, as well as playing your friends' levels and trying to be the best, it's a great game but my only concern is that at times it can just stress you out if you are stuck on one particular level, or if you can't get past this one  hard part in a level. Other than that it's a great game!",GD Review
5,2019-06-15 17:17:27,"Amazing game, I play on a 5s (small screen) and it is still fun. You can play online or offline and there’s no limit to levels you can play.

5,2023-05-14 21:18:59,"Geometry dash is an amazing game, but the updates take so long to come out can you just make like mini updates so then GD fans are still active or you could make is so people can make their own icon and the sell them for orbs on GD.",AMIZING but…..
5,2023-04-06 13:29:09,"I started playing this game whithin a month of its release, so I’ve seen what it has looked like along the way. It has always been so much fun, and they don’t update as much now, but it’s still a great game to this day!",Overall great game 👍
5,2023-04-01 07:14:00,"Alright. This is one of the BEST games to play on mobile. But, there is one bug that can affect gameplay majorly. There is a chance that when you click nothing happens. Otherwise, geometry dash is one of my favorite games.",Love this game
4,2022-07-03 22:26:10,It’s very frustrating and hard like I’ve been trying to complete a level all morning and I just keep getting close but for some reason can’t do it no reason to add any updates or anything so pls make the main levels with easy medium and hard modes,GOOD GAME BUT
1,2023-01-14 05:35:35,This has gone to far. The glitch that kicks all mobile players out of the game and prevents them from happening has been going on for a while and RobTop what do you do? Nothing. Fix this bug and make sure that either everyone who gets kicked out gets a refund or atleast can play the game that you made yourself promoted and spent time on. If you read this or someone else dose listen and don’t take this as a funny joke.,Do something RobTop
3,2023-01-01 03:30:20,"Dear RobTop, I love this game. It is incredibly addicting and super fun! My only complaint, is that it NEEDS updated. It isn’t playable on later iOS like 15 and up. It will glitch out on load screen. Considering Geometry Dash Lite already has the update, it doesn’t seem fair that the paid for app still doesn’t have the update. So please update this wonderful game!!",UPDATE!!!
5,2022-12-07 13:55:07,At the first ball part in deadlocked there’s a glitch that has a like...  10% chance of happening that when you tap or “click” I tap the green orb and it just shoots me down but other than that the game is Awesome.,Bug in deadlocked

3,2022-07-27 14:43:13,I bought the game a while back and on a different iphone7 and it worked perfectly fine after that one broke I got a new iphone7 and it crashes half a second after opening so I hope for 2.2 to fix this because I haven’t played the full version for 2.5 months now,One problem
5,2022-07-21 19:04:50,So Geometry Dash there’s this glitch that when I try to play the game it just kicks me out and I’ve been trying to watch tutorials on how to fix it but it won’t work so try and fix that😠,It just kicks me out of the game
4,2022-07-03 20:17:16,Really fun and addicting but one day when I tried to play my screen blacked out and I got kicked out of the app so I tried again and it did the same thing. After I tried for a while I gave up. Please fix this in later updates. ☹️,a BIG Problem

5,2021-10-28 01:25:44,I fun game with some very well designed levels. It is a lot of fun and the music is very good as well. It really makes you want to keep pushing and finning the level and when you do after a long time it is very much worth the effort.,Very pog game

5,2021-10-14 00:53:00,"This game is a ton of fun, I like making maps to play. One time I showed my parents the first level and they could not complete it, after they where done I completed it on the first try. LOL, I am not very good at this game but it is fun to try!!!",Fun
2,2021-10-14 21:26:29,"I just wrote a review on geometry lite and I wanted to say that the games are doing the same thing! iOS is In need of updating so I updated, then after awhile I tried to play the game and it would crash, I read a review about how the game is crashing because the developer needed the game updated in order for it to work. I only hope you read this, I like geometry dash so much!!",Update! Please Read!
5,2021-08-03 04:45:00,"I have been playing this game for a few months now, and I think that it is amazing! I think that more people should be playing this game because the music is awesome, the levels can be fun, and much more!",Pretty good game!

I’d give this more stars than five if I could. I highly recommend this. It is worth the money. I promise.",Best Game I’ve Ever Played
4,2020-06-29 19:06:02,Nice game and development but the one thing that’s making it hard for people to beat some levels is the fact that you tap the screen once and it jumps twice. I would like to make a request to fix of find the reason why it’s happening. Keep it up 😊👍,good game but there’s an issue
4,2020-02-02 00:56:53,"I’ve been playing this game for almost 3 years. And I think It’s an awesome game. Only criticisms: 1: updates are way too slow. 2: no Bluetooth controller support for mobile. And 3: discontinued screen recorder that needs to be replaced. If RobTop could fix these issues, then I would give this game a 5 star rating",Almost perfect game.
4,2019-08-04 16:04:32,This has been my favorite mobile game for five years!  I don’t really like how it is really challenging because it stops you from getting to the end of a level.  I also like how there is millions of levels to play and you can never stop playing them.  But the thing is 2.2 isn’t out yet.,Love it!
4,2019-02-20 04:59:36,I am playing on an apple tablet and when I got up to the level Time Machine and it started glitching I deleted more than 5 games and it still glitches when I get to Time Machine.

5,2018-11-20 15:14:06,Really fun! Has all sorts of challenges and I love the create your own level content! Just think Robtop should hurry up with the updates on the App Store because Steam gets it first. And he needs to learn to actually tell the truth. “2.2 will be out shortly after 2.11” one year later.....,Great game!

3,2017-09-23 15:35:33,Dont buy this game for an iPhone. When you tap it wont always make you jump because the iPhone cant keep up with the rapid taps. Its really hard when you start getting into higher levels and there is a 75% chance you will actually jump when you tap. Its super frustrating and I suggest getting this game on a computer not a phone.,Its a good game but....
5,2017-06-28 01:03:07,I tapped a button twice and it didn't even register and killed me. The maps dont look as good as the regular levels made by other ppl which shows less effort put into it. U need to fix this...,Buttons that won't jump?

5,2021-12-24 20:34:15,"I have two favorite games, Minecraft, and Geometry Dash. They are both amazing games, but since this comment is about Geometry Dash, I will put some pros and cons.  Pros: -Quick loading time -Fun gameplay -Easy customization -Practically infinite new levels, every day! -Quests and secrets -A thriving community -The ability to make your own level  Cons: -A glitch when you buy a cosmetic (in my case a ball) in the Community Shop, you cannot equip it in the normal place. This is just probably my lack of insight though.  Conclusion: A VERY good game.",Epic Game

5,2021-05-18 20:08:24,This game is fun it’s about a block that jumps over spikes and And it has to dodge objects the reason why this game is fun it’s because there’s an editor mode and you can play different levels I love deadlocked and fingerdash and Clubstep it’s just like fun this game should be the top game,Gd is fun

5,2020-08-23 15:30:31,I definitely recommend this! Hard and fun! The only problem is the devs take too long to make updates... and as for the ideas for 2.2 I think you should add a building tutorial and things  Ike yellow dash orbs. (For faster dash’s),My review and ideas for 2.2
5,2020-08-23 12:24:56,This game is amazing and if there are anymore future updates there should be a setting where you can control how high the jump pads make you jump/how long it takes for the gravity to flip after hitting a blue jump pad. This game is addicting.,This game is so fun.
5,2020-07-14 19:26:41,The basher if you hold you will break blocks not spikes.  The only way you can jump are pads also if you jump from a pad you will be able to touch a orb. The color portal will be brown. It’s design look like a block rhino.,Idea for 2.2
5,2020-06-05 21:01:11,The game is great it’s just... when it try to save something it won’t let me because it’s more than 100 objects I would very much appreciate that.  Also can immediately get all the colors when you join. It’s ok if you can’t do 1 of those just please do 1 it would make very happy if you do I’ll try to fora family members to play the game so more people will play and give a 5 star review.

5,2021-02-11 23:31:01,Totally worth buying i had it for about a year theres a level maker thats not that hard to use. And the levels are fantastic. hey haters of this game i know its hard but at least try making a level its fun! Good job RobTop i cant wait for 2.0,This is epic
5,2021-01-15 13:35:49,This game rlly good it might be hard and may make you rage but practice makes perfect some levels took me a long time to beat like deadlocked (I still didn’t beat it) but I’m still getting good I beat four demons but there easy demons ;-; but still it’s rlly good and you should get it,gam good
5,2020-12-21 21:42:00,This game is so fun and addicting and relaxing and satisfying this game has levels with music that I just like to play over and over and  I want to know how to get the full versions of this game.                   From Jackson                  Creator please respond and answer my question please,So relaxing
3,2021-01-12 02:41:03,"I understand that there are user created levels, but sometimes they just aren’t the correct one. You have had the same levels for so long, but in every update, there isn’t one thing different! Would love it if you could add a few more. Other than that it is a decent game.  P.S. Where in the dang world is 2.2?!? It’s been FOREVER since an update!",No new courses
5,2020-12-02 22:05:32,I think there should be a multiplayer too! The background would be faded versions of other players progress and that could make a racing gamemode or a tournament!(please get rid of upside down parts just please I hate them),Jhguff is correct/ I want multiplayer!
5,2020-11-08 23:00:45,Geometry dash has been awesome sense it’s release I love that you can build levels but I also think that in geometry dash lite you should be able to build because I think it’s a little unfair to the people that can’t spend money on games.,Great game
5,2020-10-07 21:13:29,"Ok, so there is a bug in the game where it doesn’t let you make a account and just keep saying: “you can’t register right now” and that is annoying plz fix it thanks",Bug
5,2020-07-17 05:39:46,I’ve been told that there will be a gamemode called “swing copter” So yeah and pls add the ability to be able to zoom as far as you want I think that’s will be a lot easier for people to build some of those long levels.   so yeah btw 2.2 WHEN?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?,Ideas for 2.2
4,2020-05-21 16:30:11,"I have been playing this for 2 years, and no update. Also, I wish we could play this offline. Like, it’s a single player game, and usually they can be played offline, but why not those gauntlets? Please, also make new levels.

5,2020-06-10 02:40:08,I love the game I always have trouble with upside down ships and ufo but it’s fine but it’s been 2 years IPhone 11 can’t even play this game and you haven’t updated when you do it,Awesome Game But when is 2.2 coming out?
4,2018-11-22 18:18:02,"Right off the bat I can say that this is a good game. I play on both phone and PC and both copies of the game are extremely fun. (Both copies have the same features) The downside is that updates take forever. We’ve been on update 2.11 for ages now, even though RobTop did promise 2.2 to be released a long time ago. This is, as far as I know, one of the most enjoyable rhythm based game.  (Read below if you’re familiar with game)  This game does get frustrating but don’t give up when you die. I’ve died on a demon at 95% like three times before completing it. If I can do this you can as well.",Really Good but..
5,2020-04-15 21:53:40,My first idea is multiplayer online with other players  the second idea is group chat where you can chat with more then 2 people from your friends list limit of players should be  10.,2.2 ideas
5,2020-04-15 20:46:27,"I wish i could rate 50 stars on this,but i play a lot and 1 thing is that i cant get my daily chests every day, and i have an account and i cant see my icon or account messages at the account part.",GOOD GAME but some things <3💙💙💙
5,2020-04-14 20:49:15,"I  love it and the people who hate the game who think that the game is hard, they’re wrong! They just need to practice. If people read this, they may want to check out my profile! My profile is, Anderswilliams. This is a GG! Bye!",This is a good game!!!
5,2020-02-19 04:30:06,"I love this game so much. It is hard, challenging. The demon levels are pretty hard. But I don’t care. I played this since I was 5 and I love it. I think you should make an update. Where there is a secret vault and you are able to go through the cage from unlocking the demon.",Awesome Game!
5,2020-01-26 19:51:59,"Geometry dash is a wonderful game that helps you with timings and jitter clicking. The only down side is that you’ll get very frustrated on a level, I’m a mobile player working on clubstep and I’ve got very frustrated but that’s where practice mode comes in.",What a game!
5,2019-09-25 01:54:26,It’s just a good game! Although I sometimes get a little stressed my favorite level is probably deadlocked it is hard but I’ll finish it one day! I want to be able to transfer my data from meltdown. I have more complaints but I’ll be nice and end it here!-Russell,Good game rubrub!
5,2018-12-25 07:27:59,"There’s is so many bugs and glitches on theory of everything 2 because first of all it’s doo doo and dumb and the same time and robtop makes slow update, it takes them 3 in half years to update the game of geometry dash.!?!?!!!?",Theory of everything tho...

5,2018-07-29 12:37:15,"I love this game. The allowance to make your own levels in a game are amazing, but being able to make levels that surpass the quality of the main levels themselves, wow. This game is a good challenge, and a good fun! 10 out of 10!!","One of a kind! Well, two of a kind..."
3,2018-03-21 17:14:12,"For example In time machine whenever you come out of a portal it’ll make you jump on its own which gets you killed. Also throughout all the levels I have noticed that sometimes when you tap to jump, your character won’t jump. So robtop games please fix these glitches and the game will be a lot better",Ok game just a lot of bugs
5,2018-02-22 20:24:23,This has been my favorite game for years now but as of yesterday my sound has disappeared I’ve deleted and redownloaded the app many times and has not come back so if you could help me with this that would be greatly appreciated,Muted
5,2018-01-28 18:12:27,"This game may seem hard and get a bit tedious or rage worthy, but it has tons of fun things to do.

5,2017-01-20 20:21:38,"ok, so i love the game, but these ""hold to dash"" things caught my interest. theres two colors, that have no difference (that i can tell). i think it would be pretty cool to have variations. for example, a blue one, once you stop holding, you go upside down, a yellow, or red one, would boost you up. a green one would do that turn effect and then flip it. the black one would boost you down after, and the purple would be normal hold to dash( as i dont see a mini jump being of much use there.) just an idea. :)",awesome update!!! but i have some ideas.
5,2017-01-20 01:22:43,Overall 6/5 stars! Worth $2! Already recommended to friends and family! There is only one bug! When I go into Gauntlets it says something went wrong! Can you please fix this bug and everything will be perfect!,Great Game One Bug

4,2023-11-04 11:57:46,It is a fun game lots of levels you can create your own other people can play your levels and you can play other peoples levels that why I like geometry dash  But some levels look weird and makes them very difficult,Geometry dash

5,2019-09-24 21:26:11,I love this game so much honestly the creating is so much fun and u can legit play anything. With all the updates there are so many things you can do in the level editor. Some creators (like serponge) create levels that dont even feel like geometry dash. Its truly an amazing game :),Ayy
4,2018-07-09 02:16:54,I made my own level and completed it in Normal mode so it didn’t work so then I Tried it in practice mode and it still didn’t work and if you need to know the name of the level that I made it is JUMPS OF INVISIBLE.         Now I can’t hear the music and it’s making it harder for me to do the levels.,Something Wrong
5,2019-08-16 22:50:09,this game is so fun i remember playing it along time ago and i decided to re download it. This game is a great way to pass time and there are no ads! i love how the levels are actually difficult and not like other games. really great game! Good job robtop!,Amazing! Love that there are no ads!!!
5,2019-03-31 13:36:49,Ok so overall the game fantastic there’s always a but so first of all practice mode what’s with the stupid not upbeat music second when you die it makes a super annoying sound it’s just one of my pet peeves so please fix it if you have time,5 stars but....

5,2018-05-31 19:00:39,I really like the outcomes of what kind of level you can make but sometimes it doesn’t let me delete things in the creator for some reason but that’s not a problem but I would say that I would play this until I die,Love The Game
5,2018-02-04 21:16:35,"This game has something for everyone to love. Whether that be the challenging levels or the mysterious story or the level editor. The gameplay is out of the ordinary and all of the levels are fair in difficulty. Well, all of the official levels.",Very Unique

5,2020-08-12 17:15:00,I love this game! Sure I’m stuck on Jumper but it’s pretty good. A like how you can make levels your self because I made a hard level. But the thing I hate is that some blocks don’t have collision and you may not know it. But other than that it’s the best game EVER!,Love it!
5,2020-08-03 23:11:39,So apart from having hard levels this game is so fun I have a good idea for 2.2 so you add multiplayer so it’s kinda like a race if you die you you restart at the beginning I love how you can also get geometry dash lite so you don’t have to buy the game to try it out.,Great Game
5,2020-07-22 23:19:54,This is my fav game in the whole world the levels are so good and best when you made the other geometry dash games I was so excited and I love the subzero one it's a 2.2 test to see what's the 2.2 update is going to be came up the work and make everyone happy :),I love this game

5,2020-06-01 19:11:31,Easy to understand pretty stable unless your playing high object levels but even then you get a warning when a level has a lot of objects a pretty good level editor all in all I recommend it to anyone of all ages,Pretty darn good
5,2020-05-24 22:56:18,"This is literally one of the best mobile games right now. When the only real complaints are that update 2,.2 is taking a while, or that the community can be weird sometimes, then you know the game is good. For only $4, this game is a STEAL.",Download this now
5,2020-05-09 04:40:12,"Ever since I started playing this game I have loved it, the community levels are awesome and the fans make great ones too I feel like this game will never get old with all the levels there are to beat this is definitely my top 3 best mobile games.",Very good game

5,2020-04-08 21:08:11,"I have over 3800 hours on this game, and it’s just great. It’s hard to start off but I think that’s why this game is so addicting. It LMS great to see yourself beating levels that you never thought you’d beat. Highly recommend","Greatest, most addicting game"

5,2019-09-28 23:48:41,Can u please release 2.2 even if it dosent have all the features cause I am SICK and TIRED of having to use move triggers to make my cube move back and plus I’ve been wanting a long time for it so can you release it please I’d appreciate if u did,please hurry up robtop
5,2019-08-26 13:31:36,In my opinion this game is great it provides you a challenge and there is always something else to do even though it costs real money it is so worth it I got my mom hooked on the game it is in my top 3 games I recommend this game thank you,My opinion
5,2019-08-22 13:49:37,"This game is awesome! I really enjoy playing all the levels that RobTop and other people made.

5,2019-08-10 18:05:14,"Great game, actually amazing game ,actually incredible game. The only thing I wish is that they let players make community icons again but its not temporarily it’s permanent meaning players could make icons at any time but robtop have to verify it to make sure it isn’t inappropriate.","Great Game,But"
5,2019-07-11 22:00:32,The game is great I have been playing for 5 years but there is a chance very low that the level will not save your completion. That happened to me a few times but once you beat the level it is easy to redo it so it is not bad.,Great game
5,2019-04-18 17:49:05,"so, let me just say this game is now my go to entertainment app i love it it is stress reliving and fun etc. i love the challenges to unlock new skins and colors. though i would like to ask if you could play with a friend on the same screen, or an online pvp mode. thank you ROBTOP for this game.",OMG I Love it!
5,2019-02-18 01:43:13,I’ve been able to avoid this by just putting mistakes under the map. But it doesn’t let me delete anything. Other wise everything is amazing. Can’t wait for 2.2,One Major Level Making Bug

5,2018-10-13 03:57:34,This game is absolutely just fantastic. Nothing else. I will say though PLEASE come out with more updates and add mor levels because I kinda already beat the story and am waiting for new challenges.

5,2017-07-31 22:49:33,I have been playing this game for 3 years and it is still as fun and enjoying to play even now. there is always new objectives and with online levels it is very hard to run out of content and levels to beat,Love this game
4,2017-04-22 19:33:14,This is a great game! You know it's quality entertainment when it makes you want to throw your device out the window of a 20 story building. I just have one problem..

3,2017-01-24 02:45:57,"Probably the best and worst update ever, and the reason why I say the worst is because the loading is a problem and most time when I try to find an online game it just gives up as if saying ""sorry man I could not do it but try again later to only crash the whole game.""

4,2021-02-19 22:47:20,Great game overall however I’m a kid under 13 so I may not know much but I believe this should be 13+ not 4+ due to graphic and triphobic levels like peaceful by Zilenox and dark levels with hanging kids “wisteria” and there is loads of social media type things but other than that amazing game,Great overall

3,2019-04-06 16:25:01,This is a good game but there are now some very adult levels added by users depicting very sexual images and positions. These are not the fault of the developers but they need to be removed and future additions monitored or the game needs a much higher age rating.

4,2017-01-28 15:17:01,It is a very fun game however there are some bugs that cause things to happen wrong. For example in deadlocked about 30% of the time the green orbs do not work the way they are supposed to and i often die in places were i dont even press anything.,Love it or hate it

5,2017-03-24 18:07:43,I was thinking about all the shards and element gauntlets there are so I came up with the idea of the dark gauntlet and light gauntlet.

3,2019-01-08 01:27:10,This is a really good game but when I'm playing  a level sometimes I will tap and it won't jump that's why I rated it 3 instead of 5 but also I think the mods should check what levels there are because people can just spam levels which are just bad and leave the good ones in the back.,Good game
5,2018-12-13 20:38:21,I’ve been playing this game since lite and I also played on my computer and I love it but the one problem is that 2.2 isn’t here this is still a great game anyway creators like viprin are making great levels,I love it

5,2020-07-02 17:46:57,So my idea is to add a dash the makes your square go in a loop. The way to use it on pc: double tap on the dash to loop. Mobile: jump then touch the orb.  Idea 2: triple mode this can be controlled by 3 people. Played 1: top screen Player 2: middle of screen Player 3: bottom of screen   If u want to use it all at once disable triple mode.  Pc way: player 1 space bar Player 2: mouse clicking Player 3: letter A  That’s all my ideas for 2.2!  And why are you taking ♾ amount of time to update it!,Ideas for 2.2!
5,2020-06-25 20:33:03,This game brings so many memories. It’s so fun and it doesn’t get boring with hundreds of levels to play. I’ve been playing for maybe 4 years on and off and I’ve gotten pretty good! Thanks for the fun and awesomeness  -Nostalgic person,Masterpiece

2,2020-03-01 19:48:36,All the levels are very redundant. The game is very broken. Half the time you die because your character doesn’t respond to you tapping the screen.

4,2020-01-31 23:05:29,Hey I don’t know if this is just a problem with me but I know that geometry dash doesn’t need wifi. But when I go to play I can do it for 5 minutes before it gets really laggy when my other apps work just fine.,Really laggy
5,2020-12-22 05:36:40,"I like this game! I play it everyday. But, on the iPads that are all screen are disadvantaged in this case. GD isn’t really full screen, it would be great if GD adapted to the player’s screen size, so it could be full screen.",Great game! But here’s an idea:
3,2020-09-13 16:44:52,I like the game but 2.2 is not here it’s been 2 years I think but this is the best game in the world it is awesome and good I like the editor! I like to make lvls and also I have rated lots of level and I haven’t been givin mod yet it will be my dream if Robtop gave me helper or mod so yeah enjoy your day and yeah that’s my review and also how do I make a feture level,This is a good game
5,2020-06-06 16:37:11,This game is amazing! I’ve been playing for about a year and I can’t stop playing! But there’s 1 bad thing about the game  2.2 wHeN?!?!?!??  Also the people who left 1 star reviews because they can’t get 1% on Stereo Madness IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE WHEN THEY START PLAYING THIS GAME 4 THE 1ST TIME,Awesome!
5,2020-05-02 22:16:19,Fix it because even on the “help page” it still does not work...Please fix thanks...I still like you game :),Invalid email
5,2020-04-25 20:24:15,"I love Geometry Dash! It’s a great game to play when trying to pass some time. The only flaw I would say is getting frustrated by not being able to finish a level, but that’s just me, really.",Great game!
5,2020-02-22 21:28:55,Great I get mad but it’s geometry dash what do you expect but I bought i character from the shop and I lost my pearl things and don’t have the character after I left the app help,Good but please read
5,2020-01-09 03:16:11,This game is so good yeah it might be frustrating and people get mad but when u pass a level it feels good because you achieve it I like this game so much I for sure recommend this game it’s amazing I don’t regret buying this,AWESOME
5,2019-11-09 19:28:13,I love this game but I want to save my progress I’m on mobile and I tried registering then I went to bloomers and went to invalid email then back but it won’t work please I really want and account ;(.,Help invalid email
5,2019-11-05 18:10:18,"This game is awesome! You can create your own levels and there are no ads! Also you have access to all the levels from lite and subzero, plus some newer levels.",My review
4,2019-09-04 18:02:55,"Whenever I log into the game and try to open my daily chest, it starts to open, but then says something went wrong. I get no rewards and I have to wait the 4 hours or the 24 hours to try again.",Daily chests
5,2019-09-06 02:11:55,So this game cost $1.99 and I think it’s worth it I don’t play other games that munch because it gets better and better everyday so I think it should get a bunch of these 5 stars,Amazed by this game
4,2019-04-27 19:34:15,First things first when the hell is 2.2 coming out and second you should rate more levels more often would rate higher but right now the game is disappointing me a bit,Good game but needs improvement
4,2019-02-07 11:57:13,RobTop. This is an excellent game! I love the make your own levels and designs the players make! The only problem is a bug where you can’t delete an object in the editor. You have to press redo. It’s so annoying. Will rate 5 stars if it gets fixed.,Really Good Game
5,2019-03-06 13:59:11,"I’ve had geometry dash for a long time and this problem keeps coming up. Whenever I pause the game and resume, the song replays and it’s bothering.",I love this but there’s one problem.
4,2018-03-14 02:40:57,"This game is very fun. When you think you have something, you mess up and it gets frustrating. I wouldn’t recommend this app for anyone with anger issues because this game can get to you and make you mad. Overall, this game is fun to play.",Ok🤷🏽‍♂️
5,2019-01-06 16:41:20,In geometry dash there’s a few things I wish changed  1. In geometry dash there are yellow people and green people yellow people can comment and get there levels rated green people can’t comment and even if there level is good they don’t get rated so why not make it so everybody is yellow  2. Add more map packs I mean seriously those map packs are outdated  3. Roptop needs to make more levels that you play to get star coins and all that stuff  But otherwise it’s a great game!,Great game but...
5,2018-11-20 00:25:00,So I have been playing this game for 3 years now and I love it!!! Even though it costs $1.99 it is totally worth it so even though I did not make this very long but let’s just say BUY IT!!!!!,Good challenge game
2,2018-11-16 23:00:31,"The game is fun but terrible because I personally have rage issues and it makes me really mad. The game is fun though, yet people that don’t have rage issues still rage at the game and the little kids parents punish them. It really pisses me off in some cases. What I think you should do is add a little more easy levels. A little bit of hard levels too.",This game is rage like
5,2018-08-14 17:31:37,it has been over a year sents u updated geometry dash plz add it plz it’s a fun game but just plz add it plz 2.2 by Ezequiel and also I made in account yesterday when I tried to get in it it won’t let me plz fix this,Plz add 2.2

3,2018-06-29 12:35:57,"It’s ok but I thought the game was supposed to be a fun game for MOBILE players, but now we can’t even enjoy it because of levels like Bloodbath or wcropolix, which are impossible for us mobile players. Also if the object count is to high for something like a pc can handle, it crashes mobile players.",Good game
5,2018-05-13 18:08:20,"This game can be really hard, but then that just makes you want to complete the games levels even more. This game is THE BEST GAME EVER!!! No joke it may be old but this game never is a bore. I highly recommend that more people play it. The money is worth it.",BEST GAME EVER
4,2017-06-12 21:35:18,"Honestly, the game is great and really challenging. But what bugs me is the glitches. Sometimes the game crashes for no reason or freezes and when it comes back on, the music is off. Other than that, this app is perfect. I am very satisfied.",Great but..
5,2018-02-19 15:29:58,It’s fun and all but I can only open it through the AppStore. I try to tap on the app but it doesn’t open. It’s really dark looking to like it has a shade of see through grey on it,Good game just one bad bug

5,2017-10-16 00:24:03,Awesome levels this game is amazing you should get it very mind challenging but your eyes can start to hurt after playing a while you also can get very mad or frustrated. Not for everyone,Geomtry dash
3,2017-10-13 01:12:07,"Don't get me wrong, I love geometry dash and think it is a great tool to enhance hand eye coordination, or just to shed some spare time, but while I was going to see how much time left on my chests, the regular one was 293 hours left, while the gold one said 313. That's okay, I can wait 13 days to get my next gold chest.","I love it, but found a glitch"

4,2019-10-05 03:25:05,It’s been two and a half years since an update!! It doesn’t need to take this long to make an update. You could make a game more advanced than geometry dash in less time than the time it takes you to make this update.,UPDATE THIS GAME!!

1,2019-06-12 17:52:54,"Hello RobTop. I lost all my data, while buying the full version. I was very disappointed. My account didn’t work and the cloud save function did not work for some reason. I spent lots of time beating levels and now I am disappointed in the backup system. Maybe have a system sort of like Minecraft, where it auto saves progress to the cloud to help players like me. Thank You, [GD]Watermellon",Lost all my save data

5,2018-12-14 22:55:13,It’s really fun and I like all the little secrets and that dungeon place for the full game but I wish you didn’t have to buy the full game for all the other geometry dash games I really recommend it 🙂,This is awesome
2,2019-02-11 22:01:11,Robert is really slacking on his updates. He never updates the game. He sends us the free versions and sits on his but collecting ad revenue instead of working on updating the game for us. It’s madness. Though I am the biggest fan of this game I’m hating it more and more because we are promised an update that never happens or comes out years late.,Developer can’t figure out what an update is.
5,2018-07-15 15:52:14,Pls add it in for profiles so when you delete the game then redownload it and when you login to your profile’s progress will be there still,Auto save
5,2018-05-15 20:49:20,Love this game! It’s fun and addictive! Although there is one problem. I can’t open my chests! Whenever I try it doesn’t do anything and says a problem has occurred.,Fun but one problem
4,2018-03-18 21:18:24,So when I started geometry dash (4 years ago) It was free but now it is 1.99 or 2.99 and I think it should be 5 or 6.99 because when you sign in you get so much more thing and my account is g3om3trycr3ator. So that is my opinion on the price,PRICE!!!😆
5,2018-04-29 14:44:43,I have been playing this game for so long and there’s nothing like the satisfaction when you fail a million times and then finally finish a level!,One of the best games!
5,2018-03-29 00:11:49,"I can’t say anything better about this game. It’s just fun, very challenging and also addictive. I really recommend buying the full version for more levels and various skins to design your character .",AMAZING GAME
4,2023-10-21 12:47:34,Geometry dash is such a fun and anticipating game when you beat a level or get close you just get so happy and it’s one of my favorite games ever but it isn’t compatible on iOS 17 so I can’t play anymore.  :/,Love the game but

5,2021-01-31 22:43:42,"Ok, here is my point, it’s da best, there lots of free versions of this making it better for people not wanting to pay for the full version, I like knock em out from the sun zero version, anyways. bye!",This game super good

4,2020-10-02 08:35:41,"I bought this game for my toddler. He absolutely loved this game, it remained very entertaining for my toddler since the day I purchased it. After the first day he started to get frustrated and hitting my phone. Now, my phone is cracked. I need a new phone. Thnx Obama.",Broken phone😭😭😭
5,2021-01-22 02:32:14,I love this game it has simple controls yet gets so hard. I do wish that 2.2 came out but still an amazing game. It is a little easier on PC but that is every mobile game,Best Mobile Game
5,2021-01-03 15:18:54,It is a good game but the levels are too hard that’s annoying I’ve spent hours but can’t beat a couple of levels I needs to be fixed.,Fun but.....
5,2021-01-02 00:04:13,RobTop should add a feature where in the shop all the icons change to your current colors to see if they actually match.,Idea
4,2020-07-29 18:17:52,It’s a good game but Every about seven times the challenge crashes then gets rid of either orbs or diamonds and I do not like that but it’s really fun you should play it and I would rate it four stars,So about Geometry Dash
4,2020-05-12 01:45:32,OBJECTS  Reverse BG object: reverses anything assigned to it  Straight up portal: makes the player go straight up (screen reverse portals make the player go straight down)  Giant portal: makes player bigger and jumps higher  LEVELS  Jump Dash Difficulty: Hard  Negative Shot Difficulty: Demon  Flip Up Difficulty: Easy  GAME MODES  Swing Copter Like how everyone knows it; Flip up and down like the ball but in midair   Ski Lift Moves up and down with the player’s finger  Fish Tap/click on the top bottom or middle of the screen to go there  Just ideas,New ideas for this game
5,2020-07-13 11:12:40,When I tap it sometimes doesn’t let me do what I’m trying to do and it’s so annoying bc then it gets me killed when I’m at like 90%,Geamatry dash
5,2020-06-30 09:56:22,"Okay, for starters I love this game! Now to the ideas, okay so, I know there is online play but what I mean is I want online play like 2+ people in the same course and race! Please make it in 2.2 I would be  very happy!",Fun 2.2 ideas... (PLEASE READ DEVELOPER)

4,2020-04-06 20:45:08,This would have been a 5 star but I have been waiting 2 years now for 2.2 I am patient waiting for news once 2.2 comes out and I see it and test it I will make this a 5 star but good look making 2.2,It’s a good game but
1,2020-05-01 18:45:01,"I hate this game so much now cause I got super good progress in one sitting on future funk (68%) and when I was practicing the level on a copied version it crashed my game, then I check my progress and it went down to 37%, it was so hard and stressful to get all the way to 68% just for it to get reset, I loved the game until this happened, it happens to often, PLSSSsSSSsS FIX THIS IM NOT PLAYING UNTIL ITS FIXED",The worst mobile bug (the reset crash)
5,2020-04-14 02:45:22,This game is the best even without the 2.2 there is much more levels and online levels! In my opinion it is a great game,Should buy!!!
5,2020-04-04 01:17:56,"This game is awesome, all of the ROBTOP levels are easy except TOE2, it just takes practice, but everything else is easy, I would definitely recommend this game to players who want a challenge.  I love the game Robtop.",Awesome game

5,2020-03-19 17:06:43,"Geometry dash is a really great game, would recommend. It provides a good challenge for new and skilled players alike. A TON of content to explore, including millions of user created levels. Solid five stars. Really great experience and lots of fun.",Great game
5,2020-03-15 08:03:25,2.2 hasn’t came out but I’m still playing Judy I think it’s gotten to the point where the greeters don’t care about the game from what they’ve left off it’s a pretty good game...... :),Lazy developers
5,2020-02-28 03:33:42,"This is the best game I have ever played. I would totally recommend this game, as it is fully worth it. The only bug would be how I lose 1 attempt to a short jump. It’s still the best tho",It’s the BOMB

4,2019-02-27 21:27:42,"I agree with the comment that says needs more content. Play this game all the time, but it just gets old. There is no updates in the last, like, five years. Needs new gameplay, needs 2.2. Other than that, great game.",Purty good

But it’s otherwise  FUNNNNN!🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 thank you for your time have a blessed day with love from me and the lord.,Bad so far...TO MANY FAILS but amusing music and style!

3,2019-02-19 02:37:01,"Personally after having this game for roughly 20 minutes, I don’t believe it’s for me. I’m not sure if there is a way I could get a refund as I could on Steam, but I can’t really afford to have things I won’t use. I still believe that it is a good game; I would just like my money back.",Not for me.
5,2019-01-10 22:37:25,I’m giving it a five star because it’s an awesome game but I lost all my progress even though I made an account and logged back in so Robtop try to fix it please.,Lost all progress
5,2019-01-05 11:48:27,This game has everything you need to have fun. IT DOESNT HAVE ADS EITHER (not including watching ads for orbs and gems). But Robtop you need to add something like multiplayer what I mean by that is you need to make it so it can be a 4 player “race”,THIS GAME IT THE BEST
5,2018-12-29 01:19:10,I bought this game and think it’s amazing but I’m trying to link my phone to it and it won’t work. Is there anyway I can do this without spending more money?,Can I get this on PC for free?

5,2019-07-03 02:42:43,Best game. It’s so fun and I can’t wait for 2.2. Once you learn how to create well and have 50+ demons this game gets suppperrrr addicting. The community is a bit toxic sometimes tho 😬.,Absolutely wonderful

3,2019-02-22 22:03:07,"This game used to be my favorite game. It made up 95% of my childhood, and I used to love it. Until... One day, I was casually playing until I went to the “daily,” and I didn’t have the song. So I clicked download, and it said “Download failed. Please try again later.” No big problem, I’ll just try again tomorrow. Tomorrow arrives, and I jump right to my favorite game, Geometry dash. And then I still can’t download music.

1,2019-09-15 00:31:13,I am truly furiously angry about this game. One of the user made levels has pornographic content and my kids are 8 and 6 years old! Who knows what other content is on this game!

5,2022-01-17 19:31:13,"I have been playing geometry dash for a while now and I have finally beaten Deadlocked for the e first time. I was very happy, but a few days later something bad happened. The new iOS 15 update came out and I was excited because every time there is a new update there is some new cool features. I found some cool things, and then I went to play some gd and when I opened it, it closed fully within 2 seconds. I wondered what was happening because it kept doing it for around two days before I did something. I googled it to see what was happening and it turns out, a lot of people are having trouble with it because of the new iOS 15 update. I couldn’t find a fix for it so I (along with many other people) went to the apple website and started asking them what we could do to fix it. They said that they were not able to do anything about it and to ask the developers because the game was not coded to work on iOS 15. I have not reached out to RobTop until now (because it’s robtop) and I am just asking. Please figure something out about the game, because I have not been able to play it for months now and I am starting to feel depressed when I’m bored now. I used to be able to click on the little icon in the corner and have loads of fun, but now I can’t. I know this might sound pathetic because it’s just a mobile game.

5,2023-10-06 22:54:09,"I loved this game since I found it in 2016, but the updates take FORRRRR EVVVVVV ERRRRRR. I understand how long it takes to update a game, but for 3 years (now 5 and nearly 6) there hasn’t been an update, I mean like at least hire some more developers or allow the community to help because any og player wants the 2.2 update and I’m sure they would be happy to help. I’ve seen the old updates and there were multiple a year, then it went to once a year, and now its been 3 years (again 5, I wrote this 2 years ago what did you expect). You just have to open the doors. Anyways that is all. Great game, bad update schedule. Update: 2.2 release date, October 2019, current date, June 2022. Just a lil bit late. All jokes aside I recently saw some “information” (I don’t know if it is factual or not) of a discord message of you say 2.2 will definitely be done by the end of 2022. I can only hope. (Totally didn’t happen) And to people who are mad that the app crashed when you open it, its not the games fault, its your devices fault. It doesn’t have enough storage to run the game so it crashes. I suppose if the game engine is completely reworked for 2.2 it may optimize this issue but it is otherwise something that it more “user error” than a problem with the game. Edit: YIPPEE 2.2 supposedly coming in less than 2 months. I can’t wait. I’m almost scared of what the new editor will do to the recent tab  Final edit: welp this is it, apple has removed support for 32 bit games and this includes geometry dash. I was hoping this wouldn’t happen but it did. If you use an apple iphone or ipad don’t download this if you are past ios 16 or ipados 17.0.3 because it just won’t load and it isn’t the games fault.","Amazing, but one thing"

5,2023-03-24 23:32:38,We’ve all been wanting it to new speed portals. I’m thinking perhaps a 0.25 times speed portal which for the Q would only allow them to jump one spike and one go and maybe even a five times B portal which will allow the cube to go seven spikes in one go which is kind of insane. I would also like to see two different orb types in the game. The brown and powerful orbs. these two different types of orbs are actually opposite the brown or would be half as powerful as the pink/purple ones and the powerful one would be double as powerful as the red ones. there would also be pad Versions of these because well we all know we’ve always wanted that black pad and green pad thanks for your adding the green pad to 2.2 but I will also like to see the black pad in a.k.a. the gravity pad in 2.3. I would also like to see A new game mode in 2.3 called the cat game mode. You can’t game mode would be able to jump a total of five spikes and loop in one times speed. you can probably think of what I would do in 0.25 and five times speed. this new game mode will be able to jump up for blocks but if it has run six blocks and it crashes into A wall that is five or less blocks tall it will be able to scale that wall up teleporting up to the top I think this will be a very good addition to the game. those are all my ideas for 2.3 and I would also love to see what mini icon you can think of for the swing copter if you put default mini Ticon on cause I’m pretty sure you could come up with some fun ones I would also like to see a tape of swing copter that kind of resembles The ball game mode because I think that could be very fun since in 2.1 we already have a swing copter which is just an altered ball game mode. PS check out swingcopter levels in 2.1.,Great game! have ideas for 2.3!

5,2023-03-24 23:32:38,We’ve all been wanting it to new speed portals. I’m thinking perhaps a 0.25 times speed portal which for the Q would only allow them to jump one spike and one go and maybe even a five times B portal which will allow the cube to go seven spikes in one go which is kind of insane. I would also like to see two different orb types in the game. The brown and powerful orbs. these two different types of orbs are actually opposite the brown or would be half as powerful as the pink/purple ones and the powerful one would be double as powerful as the red ones. there would also be pad Versions of these because well we all know we’ve always wanted that black pad and green pad thanks for your adding the green pad to 2.2 but I will also like to see the black pad in a.k.a. the gravity pad in 2.3. I would also like to see A new game mode in 2.3 called the cat game mode. You can’t game mode would be able to jump a total of five spikes and loop in one times speed. you can probably think of what I would do in 0.25 and five times speed. this new game mode will be able to jump up for blocks but if it has run six blocks and it crashes into A wall that is five or less blocks tall it will be able to scale that wall up teleporting up to the top I think this will be a very good addition to the game. those are all my ideas for 2.3 and I would also love to see what mini icon you can think of for the swing copter if you put default mini Ticon on cause I’m pretty sure you could come up with some fun ones I would also like to see a tape of swing copter that kind of resembles The ball game mode because I think that could be very fun since in 2.1 we already have a swing copter which is just an altered ball game mode. PS check out swingcopter levels in 2.1.,Great game! have ideas for 2.3!
