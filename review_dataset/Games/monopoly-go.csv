I haven’t completed some one star gold sets, and I got 12 of the same 3 star gold sticker, I just want camolet so I can get the cyclops token. It shouldn’t be this hard, I know y’all want us to spend our money but everything cost too much. 9.99 for 225 dice! Come on now. We are playing the game at least give us stuff for fair prices. Food and cost of living is already so high at least make This game fun to play, I mean it’s no fun if you can get what you need to progress l.also need to make it where people can’t scam, it’s sad how many people will scam, need to make a thing where it’s an agreement and both players have to put their stickers up and both press agree before anything is sent. Also on the events we should be able to complete them on our own without partners just give us half the points. People scam like that too. I haven’t completed any event cause people wouldn’t help with the points. Plus why a limit on rolls? The board game doesn’t have a limit smh. I’m also not receiving any of my prizes from the events on the side. I’ve placed 1st for a week and only gotten 1 of them ughhhh, I would be ahead with dice but I’m out",Cost too much
4,2023-09-05 22:34:34,"Okay, so I love LOVE LOVE this game, so addictive BUT you for sure need to make it so we can either A) Get the full amount of dice that you’re able to get in that hour, for example I’m —/70 so every hour I would get 70 dice. I can’t with this waiting man hour to only get 7 rolls, it’s lame and makes me not want to play till my dice is full. It’s stupid. Also, why the heck is there a limit on sharing Stickers? Atleast make it 10 stickers a day because 5 is ridiculous and who actually can finish the whole album? Not many. Like come on? I think people would have so much more fun with their friends and family trading stickers together. It’s a game inside a game. And I’ve actually starting talking to my friends more because we go back and forth on stickers. Make the trades more PLEASE! Also, when we finish a board we should earn a sticker or 2 or a gold sticker. When you level up, you should get more dice than 50. Im on level 56 and every single time I’ve completed a board I’ve gotten 50 rolls? The heck!? Have the rolls slowly go up each time you win even if it’s by 5’s or 2’s. It’s fun. Let it not be a drag waiting and waiting, I think if the problem was fixed with regeneration every hour this wouldn’t be neeed so come on. Choose one. Overal, addictive, fun and I love LOVE that you can’t chat within the game,makes me feel like my kids are safer while playing. Hopefully my review gets read and we can make some changes that I see so many others are dealing with.",Rolls and Stickers
3,2023-10-22 13:48:10,"First, I would like to say, I do you enjoy playing this game. I’m not so far along that I have rolled over with the same type of cities over and over again as some people are saying, but I still find the game fun.  Now onto my main complaint. the amount of pop-ups you will have to shut down is absolutely ridiculous. As a grown adult, I can very well see where I can purchase more die if that is my objective. After all, the offers take up half the screen. I should not have to shut down 5 to 6 pop-ups just to continue gameplay on my last few rolls of die. Making pop-ups that I have to shut down not only when I open the app, but anytime I run out/low on die is infuriating. I once shut down 30 pop ups in one session of game play because I was able to acquire additional die after I ran out, but every single time I ran out, there were those ridiculous pop up trying to push me to buy more die. The pop ups do not make me wish to purchase more die. If anything, it infuriates me to the point where I want to delete the game almost every time.  I understand you want to make money on your app. Still, you don’t need to make such a hard push for it to happen. Trust me. The people who wanna accomplish missions at a much faster pace with higher rewards are going to spend the money. I just don’t happen to be one of them.  I would be fine with the pop ups once a game. (At the very beginning or at the end, but give me a break already.",The in app pop ups are a nightmare
5,2023-10-27 21:03:45,"I really enjoy this game, I dont know why but it is. Maybe because there is nothing to lose other than your real money lol. But I don’t spend my money  on this game I go hard on getting my boards done with the dice that been given. Things that could make it more fun. Give more dice after certain level. I don’t know where but it be nice to have more dice after you completed your board. I love the card collection but I don’t like that have to wait to get a new card after certain amount of days.  I know you guys want to spend money to get those card but I am not.  Also notice a pattern when your rolling your dice and doesn’t land on specific spots on the board. Algorithm is so obvious that annoys me that I see it land between rewards or shields that I could use.  After certain amount dice left it starts rewarding you, when your so low on rolls you can’t do anything. We should be able trade out extra cards for dice. One thing if people who don’t use Facebook or refuse to go on Facebook should be able trade cards from the friend group or the general group. Including the gold cards. What the point having An extra gold card if you can’t use to trade it. I think got everything that could be better with This game. I really enjoy it to pass the time and play with friends and family.",Very fun
3,2023-11-03 10:12:18,I have played this game since April when it came out and the more I play it and spend money on it I start to feel scammed. The dice cap is ridiculous 80 dice won’t get you no where minus the fact y’all charge 5$ for it!! How can you expect people to keep playing the game when we don’t even have rolls!! Cards too! 15k dice sounds real nice until you notice 70 days later you keep getting the same cards… Not to mention the “trade groups” filled with a bunch of scammers! I’ve spent 100s on this game just this year alone and haven’t got anywhere. And the tournaments are RIGGED! U have “people” with 10 thousand plus in the first 5 minutes it’s sick! A little constructive criticism from someone who plays the game everyday.. the idea of the game is great but with things like this you guys will eventually become a memory! And why can’t you trade gold cards you should be able to trade ALL cards! It becomes sad when we have to pay our way to PROBABLY win… I understand it’s a game of chances but when is my chance? Y’all have HUNDREDS of people on Facebook asking you guys to fix your game literally we are telling you what’s wrong with it and yet and still .. nothing done. Is this just a scheme to get money? I’m not getting it if you really want your money you would FIX YOUR GAME to keep people around cause if not I WILL QUIT and not just me EVERYONE will start to quit it’s only so much we can try before we’re gone forever then what? fix the game brahh,FIX THE GAME!
3,2023-10-27 16:18:55,"At first this game was so much fun, really hits back on memories of playing the board game as a kid.  It has definitely changed from the time I started playing till now, the expectations to compete or complete their daily or two day tournaments has become insanely ridiculous, the partner challenges are close to impossible to complete. The only real way to get ahead and be on the top leader board is to buy dice and use the higher multiplier.  That being said, it brings me to my next point of leveling up. No matter how high you get, you’ll be capped at 80 dice for a full reload without needing to buy dice, no matter how high you get on completing a board, you’ll only ever get 50 dice for completing the board, mind you at this moment in the game, it takes me roughly collecting $35,000,000 to fully complete a board, and for what? A reward of a couple million dollars and 50 dice…..it’s a joke. If the dice reload and dice rewards would increase as you progress higher, it would make sense but it doesn’t.  I won’t even touch on collecting cards for the season album challenge, unless you’re buying packs that guarantee you get a card that you’re missing (which isn’t often) you’ll be stuck. And yes there are tournaments where you can win said pack, but you need to be first, and roughly every competitor I’ve gone up against is racking in about 50,000 points, if you play the game, you know how ridiculously hard that is.",Manage Expectations
4,2023-10-14 12:16:52,"This game is great, however. Few things to point out. Sometimes the game glitches and the number on the dice isn’t how far you go on the board so you miss a chance at whatever reward you were going to get. Also the multiplier was a great idea but it takes the same amount of rolls you choose for your multiplier per roll which makes you not wanna use it at all because it’s not easy to get free rolls they cannot be shared amongst players. Maybe I just haven’t figured it out yet but I guess not every player can get new shields because I’m at level 30 something and still have an orange shield. Also you can’t revisit boards you completed what was the point in making them so nice if they don’t interact. Mini games inside of previous boards would be great so that we could earn rolls or shields for ourselves and friends. Cash grabs aren’t appealing because you rarely get over a million unless you pay for the game maybe I’m not sure. The time it takes to gains a good amount of rolls I could be used in a mini game so people would spend more time on the app. Also it’s keeps sending me to steal from my friends in heists and bank heist even after They unfriend me and it gets annoying maybe versing each other in mini games would be more fun but getting sent to the same people who have helped build toys etc is crazy. Game is cool though.",Good game to pass time
4,2023-08-14 02:34:43,I love this game. But I will only give 4 stars as this is a pay to play game. You don’t advance anywhere or get any of the big rewards you need to advance without paying. Even with the events you barely get anything. The thing with the sticker album used to be my favorite but I’ve bee. Stuck at the same sticker amount for 2 weeks now. Which I get can’t them all quickly but I have 17 of multiple different cards. I have multiple of the gold cards as well. Can’t ever seem to get cards I need but many of the gold cards and I can’t even trade the gold cards. The car event going on right now I do love the partner thing but unless you use a multiplier to get more at one you only get one but it requires 20 of the part to even spin once. I used 400 dice today and didn’t even get close to landing on that many. I just wish you could advance better and have a more fair chance at getting the bigger rewards than paying to play. Or at least get more dice daily. And more than 50 dice when you advance to the next board. 50 dice might have been something up until board 20 but at board 50 that isn’t anything at all when you have to use the multiplier to even make enough cash to upgrade a single landmark once. I do still love the game but it’s annoying that it is mostly a pay to play game. Not as friendly and kind to those that aren’t paying.,Love the game
3,2023-07-01 21:21:22,"I have played this game so much and I love the concept 100%. I’ve put a lot of time and money into this. I’m all the way on board 135 so I definitely got enough play time to critique it. So the things about this game I don’t like weigh heavily on my rating. I don’t like that once you have gotten so far on the map that the boards start to repeat themselves. I feel it would be better if they allowed you to complete all the boards that are currently available to give you that sense of accomplishment for the time being until a new update that put news boards into place. Instead I got a sense of disappointment when I kept seeing the same boards over and over. Another MAJOR issue is the fact that there is no safe space to do sticker trading, I have had many people through the official monopoly Facebook trading group take my cards and block me leaving with nothing. I feel the game needs to put a trading space into the game that could at least penalize the party in the wrong during the trade. The customer service is non existent for anything so you will not at the current time reach a positive solution if you are scammed out of cards. Hence why everyone has been scammed in the community and also I feel another problem which is minor is the bet to prize ratio if I bet x100 I deserve good prizes not the same prizes or stickers someone betting at x1 can receive mainly talking about the completed color sets.",Can be a great game!!
5,2023-08-27 00:53:04,The only thing I don’t like is that when you finish a board I think every other board you should get a card to finish your album instead of them constantly giving you the same card over over over again and on top of that mega heist they cheat on that because if you roll a dice and you get the 15min mega heist they don’t let you get all your heist. You will go around the board multiple times on shut downs so you’ll miss like 3 mega heist so out 4 mega heist you gonna get maybe 1 because they’re gonna change it to a normal heist and I think it’s not fair. It’s fun because you have friends you can laugh knocking down properties lol and doing heist but that’s my major problem and sometimes when you go around the board it glitches so if you know the number on the dice it’s not gonna let you land on that card on the board.  I never like to play board game because I think family cheat sooo this the ONLY way I’ll play lol.. Another thing if you report something to them they’ll ask you for a picture but if the people that’s playing constantly complain then fix the problem. It’s hard to get rolls I feel it shouldn’t take hours to get rolls and I feel we should be able to share rolls with each other if someone don’t have anymore.. But other then that it’s cool game,Only problem
4,2023-10-28 15:10:02,"I enjoy playing the game but I think there need to be some changes. For starters, events need to last longer than 6 days because not many people can get all 4 bars filled by time the event is over. Event tokens are already hard to get with no dice and a low multiplier. On top of that, the dice regenerate really slow. Like why do I only have 14 rolls in two hours? Second, cards have to be more accessible. I keep getting a thousand duplicate cards and rarely get 4 and 5 stars, as well as gold cards. You guys want people to have fun, but the only way we can win the events and complete the albums is by spending money on dice. I feel like 10 dollars should get me more than 250 dice because that’s just a scam at this point. It’s no reason for me not to be able to complete all the albums within 90 days. It’s like you don’t want players to win which will inevitably push players away. I’m not saying to make everything easy to get, but at least decrease the rarity of certain cards. Lastly, there should be other prizes other than 50 dice and one star stickers after completing a board. We should get like a gold sticker or at least a card we need every time we complete a board. I literally get the same cards every time I complete a board which is a waste of time. But overall the game is cool, but could be better.",Three Must Needed Changes
5,2023-09-06 15:42:54,"I love this game and a little addicted now but this new update is fun and better! The only things that I would like to see if better chances or better odds at getting more dice! The set rewards are not worth it unless you finish the entire album! Just saying, if the prices were matching the dice amount, then it would be more interesting to buy dice. 3200 is nowhere near enough. Example: if it was 10k dice for $100 and 5k dice for $50, then it would be more enticing to get dice and spend money for those tons of people that spend money on the game! But instead there are a bunch of scammers and people that get people to send stickers and finish their own sets and album before everyone else. They end up having tons and tons of dice to use while the majority of us have hardly anything to use on the game. We aren’t having fun if we can’t get any good amount of dice to use. The amounts that are on the daily events that go on, those amounts are so high that people get to a point where they are so close and not enough dice to keep going and finish.  If you can kindly take that information into consideration, that would be much appreciated! As for myself, I’m one of those that is just stuck doing the everyday login steps and that’s it.",Overall great! But things need change
2,2023-09-05 08:18:34,"Level 110 & I’m starting to get to the point where it’s just about $1b to complete the map. This is getting ridiculous & not fun. I used to be on this app every other hour trying to complete maps, sets & those little challenges at the top. Now I’m getting on like 2/3 times a day bored being that I can’t really trade to complete a set, everything’s so expensive & I’m running low on dice. I refuse to spend any more money on this game because they clearly know what they’re doing making it a pay to play game. It was cool spending a dollar or two to actually gain something in return but this game’s so rigged you end up going through half of your rolls before winning anything at all. I used to love this game & I’m starting to hate it as it lead me to write this review, this used to be fun & competitive now it’s not. Just boring as maps recycle & them wanting us to pay to play. It isn’t right for us that enjoy playing the game without having to spend money. Inflation is high enough. They quite literally exposed themselves on this newest album. I used to defend them as console/PC gamers pay for (depending on the game) VIP, cool skins, game money etc. now it’s getting out of hand. I should be given AT LEAST 500 rolls when I complete a map as it took me maybe 1000+ to complete! & 100 rolls after I run out & wait the hour. This game went downhill unfortunately & had a lot of potential. Many people disappointed & deleting the game.",Fun at first eventually boring-Developer greed
2,2023-11-06 17:36:40,"I used to love this game. It was similar to another board game app I used to play until they tightened it so much that it was aggravating. I’m afraid the same has been done to Monopoly Go now. Although once I could sit and play for long moments at a time that’s impossible now. I would win more dice and more money at a level 10, then be able to increase it to 20, winning more dice and money, then increase that level etc. I could actually finish building each property in a group. Now, the rewards have been reduced. I’m lucky to get to a level 10 before running out of rolls. I have to leave the game with properties unfinished which allows other players to shut me down before I have enough rolls to continue playing. Whereas once I could play non stop for half an hour easily I now run out of dice after about 10 minutes. This isn’t fun anymore, each day’s game is too short, and to get to the next board takes FOREVER. This game has been tightened up too much, the daily dice rewards are significantly smaller.  The money grab game has gotten too easy. I get every bill every time and the amounts of money seem to be smaller. This should be more challenging and a larger reward if one is successful.  I am not going to play a game that takes me a week to advance to the next property level, it’s like crawling to the finish line. I’m deleting this. And the only reason it gets two stars is because it was fun a few weeks back.",Game has been wrecked by greed
3,2023-10-13 17:13:28,"So I do enjoy this game very much…why did I leave the 3 stars??? ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 1. I have informed them I cannot add someone as a friend, so in order to share stickers, I have to have them as a contact in my phone or Facebook. So although they have Facebook groups to exchange stickers… you can’t unless your friends in the game and I’m not about to add a bunch of people to my personal Facebook just for stickers ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 2. Speaking of stickers…. You end up for 6 to 10 extra stickers on one sticker and barely get new ones, so to finish that challenge is extremely hard and most times not able to. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 3. They will do team builds, you have 4 days to build 4 things with one other person per build. Sounds possible, but never once have I gotten all 4! I got 3 done, but unless you drop a crap load of money for extra rolls you aren’t getting it done. They need to give you at least a week to accomplish the goals. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4. I am pretty high up on the map, this is the main reason for the 3 stars.. I’m bored! They stop putting new cities up and start repeating… like I did Philadelphia twice and it’s the exact same thing. ⭐️⭐️⭐️So why do I still play??? I wanna try and get them darn stickers 😂😂😂 I am determined. Just wish they would fix the issues that have been addressed in a private message….. and no the adding new friends is not a setting issue with my phone… it’s an app issue.",An addicting game.
4,2023-07-20 12:11:05,"The game is fun and a great way to pass time. My husband is almost done with it, my daughter is playing and myself! There’s just a couple things I would change or maybe add to the game. All 3 of us think it shouldn’t be an hour before you get more dice and if you Lee it like that at least give more than 7. Second, we wish you could share stuff like DICE 🎲!! You should be allowed to send dice to your friends just like cards!!! People get bored when they run outta dice and can’t ask anyone for more and u have to wait an hour by then u forgot about until who knows when . That’s what happen to my neighbors family all 6 ppl started playing with us at the same time and when they ran out of dice they just forgot unless I remind them! And lastly, the cards being so freaking hard to get even when u buy or get blue and getting so many of the same one is a bit ridiculous!! I’ve passed 9 levels and still haven’t received any new cards neither have my husband and daughter, and my his is on level 110, my daughter just started not to long ago and she has been forgetting it as well sometimes but she’s on level 33 and I’m on level 71.

3,2023-08-31 12:48:43,"I love the game. I hated monopoly in life, so ain’t that something lol. Being on level 90-something and strategically trying to get more dice shows my insanity and loyalty to this game. I think the developers need to continue working on a good amount of things. I joined the Facebook trading group as I realized how important it was to complete these albums. However, other people are ruthless and disloyal. They say they’re going to trade with you, but then they ghost you. I was surprised when I traded the first time that it wasn’t really a true trading system within the game, just a way to gift. There’s no way to track your trading either. Just like the history tells you someone shut down your landmark, it should tell you that you traded (blank) card with “said person”. However, I also like the idea of gifting, so I think they should implement both options in the game.   The game is also rather glitchy. I needed 10 more coral to will 1,100 dice in the limited aquatic series, but I woke up this morning to find I needed about 90-sum to get it. Like what??? Oh sometimes my dice roll will have me land on something one more or less than the number I rolled. But maybe that sort of thing just happens. 🤷‍♀️  Also, I hate that my odds are the same when I do high stake rolls. Its great I get more $$$ per the rolls, but at least allow me to have s a higher chance of high value cards.","Great game, but unfair at times"
2,2023-10-17 19:43:02,"This app has allowed groups to be created to trade stickers. This app has has issues that it will crash or have a glitch and progress isn’t saved. They will let you know when there are issues and when it’s fixed and tell you they are reimbursing you. I have been been waiting since the toy glitch for reimbursement. I have spent A LOT of money in this app and I keep getting emails they are going to handle my  reimbursement and it’s on the way and yet I still haven’t got it. People are scamming people left and right out of their stickers , and myself, again had spent money to get what I have only to have things stolen from me and this is happening way too much. We are losing what we have earned and not paid back for it. I have contacted admins and moderators and customer service it seems like nobody cares.  The higher levels you need a lot of dice which costs money because they only give you 8 dice an hour, the wheel is set up for first 5 levels basically to win anything and you don’t get the cards you need unless you spend a lot of money to get there. People were cheating using airplane mode to get their winnings and those who are  not cheating are being taken advantage of. None of this is ok and this developer probably isn’t going to care about any of this because guess what they are rich off of us. If you don’t have this app don’t fall for it. It’s a rabbit hole and you could lose out huge",Scammers and costs
3,2023-10-28 12:57:21,"Between 3 and 4 stars is what I would give. I’ve been playing for a while and while it’s a cute and fun game, it’s almost impossible to get all the stickers without spending money. The gifting sites are ok but not great since everybody really needs the same things. It’s been weeks and I haven’t gotten  anything new from sticker packs even though it says you will by upgrading boards, completing daily tasks, etc. It seemed like this time with new stickers would be better because there is only 1 gold one in each pack, but it’s so rare to get anything once you’re needing 4 and 5 star stickers. Not only did the up the biggest safe from 1500 stars to 2500 stars, but they also upped the contest that you play with friends. You barely get the wheels you need to spin. Realistically the only way to get anything you need is to spend money. The tasks at the top make no sense sometimes. Ex. You need 35 brooms for 75 dice but then you need 150 brooms for 200 dice. Then they get unrealistic of needing 3500 for a new piece and 300 dice. The plinko game is rigged now to never get to the end. The first couple of times I was able to complete to the end, but it’s about impossible now. They’re baiting people into spending money by making unrealistic goals. That just about takes the fun out of it. Other people may be willing to spend money on a game, but most people aren’t.",Fun but hard to get anything
1,2023-11-11 04:11:07,"The game itself is fun but part of the whole gameplay experience is trading stickers utilizing their Facebook page specific for trading with other page members. Well when you sign up you agree to the terms and conditions including that if you get caught cheating, manipulating the gameplay or the page members by not completing your end of a trade that you will be banned among other consequences. This I have found to be false. They don’t hold anyone responsible for anything. I messaged costumer service reporting an individual who agreed upon a trade with me and received the sticker I sent them only to them blocked me on Facebook without having sent anything in return. I sent  our conversation screen shots and all other pertinent information to customer service with no response. I commented multiple times about the person scamming people and tagged the customer service and the facebook page administrators…. Nothing. Upon doing a little research I found that this particular individual had been doing this time after time to multiple others over the past three months. Despite having been reported numerous times the person is still active on the Facebook page trying to scam others and active on the game. I would highly recommend never spending any money of this app!!!!! If you have any complications or get taken advantage of by others manipulating the game you are out of luck. They don’t care.

Now the makers of this game if that sound like it’s fair you and your family and friends must not play because you know it’s a scam! You developed this game and had everybody in a chokehold playing it and losing sleep especially me! I no longer want to play the partner games because some of the partners don’t even attempt to try! Why agree to be a partner to someone if you not gonna at least try? So I pick up the slack for the lazy person and they reap the benefits by doing nothing!

4,2023-11-09 11:17:22,"So, I love this game because it’s something mindless I can do when my anxiety is up, and this distracts me enough but isn’t a mental drain like some of the other games I enjoy from time to time. I haven’t had to spend exorbitant amounts of money to enjoy it, which is why it stays on my phone. I don’t mind supporting devs, but some games get excessive with the money grab.  What I dislike is the inability to choose your profile picture unless you’re linked to Facebook. I don’t use Facebook; I don’t like it and I don’t want to feel pushed into using it for one game. I don’t like that there seems to be no way to collect more shields or icons. They come along so rarely, as do new stickers (which again feels like a whole other way to push you into using Facebook to trade with other players). There’s no real in game way to communicate and work with other players, and if you have friends in game, there’s no way to tell how active they are. You will do a car building or bakery event where you need a friend to team build, but it’s like the group science projects in school where one person does all the work while the other enjoys the benefits.

4,2023-09-10 11:37:04,"This app/game is extremely addictive and is fun to play. However, the most recent update for the newest album has this game not feeling like as much fun. I’ve had most of my money consistently stolen by bots every day for the last week, over 350 BILLION at a time every time. This isn’t fair, first of all, and really seems like the game is just stealing money so you don’t get “too big for your britches”. Secondly, the rewards are more minimal and harder to achieve, which means less actual play time for everyone playing because there’s aren’t dice to move around. The sticker sets are also almost not worth it for the minimal dice it gives you as payout for set completion, and one gold for every set, I mean cmon. Third, the algorithm for things such as wheel boosts is nonconsistent, and it would be nice if it was able to be counted on every few days/hours the way it was in the past, that way you at least have an alternative route to be able to receive rewards.  All in all, I understand from a business perspective the need to change the algorithm to make money off of sales. BUT for those of us who use this as a free app and have for months, we’re disappointed that it seems to be only about making money and not upholding the quality of the actual game.",Not happy with recent changes.
3,2023-10-27 06:49:06,"This game makes you want to spend your real money. After playing this game for two months and spending over $50 on stupid stickers and dice rolls, I’ve realized that this game is rigged. I didn’t play this game for 24 hours and all I earned was 125 rolls. That is really lame. The rolls you gain per hour should increase when your landmark costs balloon to +$30 million. Just starting the game and when you’re about to run out of dice rolls, the pop ups become constant and annoying! Like stop it already! I know I’m running out of rolls!  More concerning issues: My dice rolls don’t go to the correct space, the promotional tournaments and special games don’t let you succeed, you have to spend and buy extra dice rolls to collect more unique stickers (you’ll never achieve collecting all because they rig the game), and there are bots in the game that sabotage you i.e. there is one player that targeted my landmarks 67 times in one day. How is that possible? You have to land on a Railroad to have the opportunity to shut down another players’ landmarks. How can one player land on a Railroad 67+ times? Is he only playing 1x per dice role?! Don’t play this game unless you have $ to spend and don’t let your kids play this game. It’s rigged and there’s very little reward. But if you do play this game, don’t buy anything! I’ll continue to play Royal Match.",Addicting and expensive

The only downside of this is you can’t get help when your having an issue in app I was previously on level 198 and had 150 stickers into the new album and I’ve lost my progress the app kept freezing which caused me to have to reinstall and sign back in and when I did so all my progress was gone I’ve reached out to the support team on several different occasions, on there different social media platforms and no one have seem to be able to help me, they can’t even put me in touch with someone on there team who could. I feel like they communication and response time could be 100 percent better. Also I want to let anybody know keep track of your player id number as this will be key if you experience an issue like the one I did and hopefully you won’t because this is very frustrating that you can’t get real-time help from there support team. I hope that this review reaches someone on the team and they get back to me as soon as possible.",Not so fast support

It’s hard to gain cause you put the prize so far out there that it’s ridiculous. I spent the last five months collecting 11k dice on my own without paying for any of it.  And by the end of this event I’m left with 9.5k dice no rewards and don’t get to finish the car event.. I like the game but I do believe a lot can be done to make this gaming experience a lot more better…. Like the stickers are repetitive after you get so many you can’t trust someone to send you what you ask for you have scammers out there and they’ll take and not give I’ve had it happen to me. I’ve been playing for almost a year now and I know it’s a really relaxing fun game but the ambition is set extremely high…. The rewards are far fetched… literally please look into bettering the reward on all events for the cars and wheels…. Better the stickers to where you at least get all sets completed within desired time…,Glitching stickers and dice
1,2023-08-13 20:09:33,"I have written before about the shields, and no way to account for how many you have! Couple of days ago I had over 200 shields! According to my timeline, only five people who attempted to take down my landmarks. I had one shield left 200-6 isn’t quite one. This morning I had left the game with about 20 shields. I have one left and three people have taken a shot at my landmarks and three of my landmarks had to be fixed! Now we get to the stickers! Not quite something to get excited about winning when most of the time you just get duplicates of what you already have. I just used 100 stars to get four stickers and three of them are duplicates of what I just had. And you’re just supposed to trade for what you want on the Facebook page which hasn’t worked since I started this game about a month ago! I just got rid of three games that were just frustration and I’m about to add monopoly go to the list!!  Are you ever going to do an update on the shields? Between midnight last night and 9 AM this morning I had over 1000 shields.! Now I look, and I only have three. Timeline says only eight people tried to attack! Doesn’t quite add up! In case you’re interested, 8+3 does not equal 1000. And the stickers, that’s really getting to be ridiculous! Oh, boy I got a blue pack! Now I got six or eight more stickers that I already have 10 of each. You could just take them out of the game. It’s no thrill to get them. Just takes time away!",Getting to be a waste of time!
2,2023-09-26 22:28:04,"This games has its moments of being fun. However, it is hard to get anywhere when you have to have sooo many dice . Buying packs of stickers is a waste of money as you mostly get repeats. The fact the the golden stickers are not able to be traded yet somehow get more of those than the ones that are needed, is garbage, maybe would be better if the game could realize you have the sticker and don’t need it?. I’ve had several sets simply need the gold sticker for two weeks now and still cannot get no matter how much time I’ve spent playing the game. I’ve been stuck at 140 stickers of 180 for over a week now. Even with following the trading group. People are so stingy when it comes to simply getting something you need. You never get any more than so many dice unless you happen to get lucky or spend unnecessary money to buy. Then you use those all up trying to get somewhere with stickers/money/ and competitions, and get no where! Also, a competition can start and literally within an hour, someone have 5k collected and you are struggle getting anywhere with collecting anything. Also. When you complete a board, I’ve noticed regardless of how far in the levels you are you ONLY get 50 dice but can spend (where I am at) almost 300 million to complete the board. The game is good in its own ways. But I think it has a very far way to go to make it a game that you can actually get ahead.",Eh
5,2023-08-16 00:39:06,"Monopoly Go was introduced to me as a care free, enjoyable and overall social game that was fun to pass the time with and a good way to keep a conversation going amongst friends. As I discovered the high of completing sticker packs, finishing cakes or cars, destroying monuments and seeing that you have over 2000 rolls, I became completely addicted. I started to play it every waking moment of my life without apology. Constantly chasing that thrill of success which I never have gotten in real life. I have cut ties with all of my friends, my family no longer speaks to me and my wife left me and won sole custody over our 3 year old child. She wouldn’t even agree to at least compensating me with Momma Mammoth which I thought was very unreasonable. I have emptied my bank account and maxed out 5 credit cards just so that I can purchase more rolls and stickers. Now I have a lien on my house from a $200,000 dollar loan I received. I’m happy I did that because it got me all the way to board 74! Being on board 74 is without a doubt, my greatest accomplishment. Thank you developers for changing my life for the better. I have a direction and a purpose now. I owe that to you all. God bless you and keep up the good work!",I’m bankrupt in real life.

3,2023-08-29 08:22:39,I love the game but they could and should have a gold trading day whether it’s a free hours or an entire 24 hours to make up for so many different time differences that people are able to play. Also the price of some of the packs is crazy. How do you charge 100 dollars for a pack with dice for a mobile game is insane and the few packs I have bought I regretted afterwards as I rarely get new cards and the last pack I was charged and never received. They responded and said to check for an update which I did need but I started looking online and apparently it was a known issue and I even submitted proof of my bank charge and still 3 days later I got nothing and it was supposed to be a guaranteed new card which would have finished my set and now I’m stuck trying to find my last gold card on my own because I’m not paying for another pack and I’ve spent so much money on this game already and every time I say I’m done spending money I spend more but this time unless I get refunded or an equivalent amount of dice and packs they were supposed to give me before the event ended as that pack would have finished it than I won’t spend any more money on this game as it can’t be trusted and their response or investigation team takes forever to respond. They will prob  as boy responds after the event is over. Go figure.,Could be better
3,2023-08-06 12:00:04,"This is a really fun and addicting game, but I’m at the point of deleting it. I’ve seen majority of the reviews talking about the cards and I’ve had pretty good luck with it but my issue stands with the bankruptcy. I don’t know why but it seems as if in the middle of the night these random accounts attack my bank with these high dollar amounts (hundreds of millions) and steal some if not all of my money. It’s becoming a daily thing and I’m honestly sick of it. Since I joined through Facebook apparently I can’t do bank heists outside of my friends and it’s really frustrating because it’s only these small amounts that I can steal. It’s completely not fair that these random accounts can take my money but I can’t come back and steal theirs. Like please make this far, if I can’t steal from random accounts they shouldn’t be able to steal from me. I feel like there needs to be an update for this. Another thing is the dice. It’s truly aggravating when I have to wait over an hour just for 5-7 dice. Please update to where you can share dice between friends. Overall, you have a nice concept but please please do something about people stealing tons of money. I find it very suspicious that anytime I make a huge amount it all of a sudden gets stolen. Seems like a tactic for the app to get me to spend money. If it is, it’s wrong and a SCAM.",Fun game but….
1,2023-07-19 22:46:16,"Honestly the game was very fun in the bringing until you reach a certain point. Now it costs way too much, probably well over $3 billion, to complete ONE board and theres definitely not enough dice given to maintain gameplay. Even when collecting the max dice and combining with the free daily gifts, call it luck or call it the algorithm of the game (I’m going with algorithm) it does absolutely nothing. It’s gotten increasingly harder to win any challenges or win any gifts from challenges even when using multipliers. The bars for the challenges hardly move, I will land on 3-4 people for shut down on X10 and the bar will still not move more than an inch and that’s not even being in the top 30 of the challenge. The community chest has only been landing on 3 people and falling on the same key daily to open immediately after for about 2 weeks now. This just feels like the developers are making it harder to give any free gifts as a ploy for you to purchase rolls, money, stickers, etc. Personally, I don’t have extra money to blow on a game, I play this to take my mind off of the stress in my personal life and disconnect a bit, not too blow a paycheck and stress some more. Plus even if I did want to spend $4.99 on 50 dice, there’s no incentive for it truly, the way the game is set up you won’t get your moneys worth unless you splurge on the most expensive offer. I see no point in playing this game any further. It’s stagnant.",Not fun anymore just a daily chore
1,2023-09-26 17:09:49,"The game was great for a long time but lately I noticed with some “updates” they been letting complete strangers hit your structures and rob you, which has been a feature on the game but it’s become different recently. Now if you spend a certain amount of time on one board or have a large amount of money and not doing anything on your board they will try to “force” you to use it by having “strangers” (might be even bots) steal as much money as possible, sometimes all of it. How I know is because I had almost a billion on there and ONE person who I’ve never interacted with before on the game was able to steal 981 million dollars from me (which was all my money) at one time. I’ve had this game since the beginning and it’s never had this type of aggressiveness until more recently with updates. I never was in a “rush” to finish my board before. Sometimes you might be trying to save your money to create your board all at one time. It’s understandable some people will rob you or collect rent from you while you waiting for your rolls to come back up or the free gifts or whatever the case may be, but the extreme aggressiveness the game has gained now on trying to get people to do their boards and finish landmarks is annoying & unfair to me. Don’t even waste your time downloading it unless you just going to be playing it every hour or is willing to make purchases like getting more rolls & money.",Do not even waste your time
3,2023-08-23 14:19:06,"Great game and very well developed. But I do have some suggestions. 5 star stickers can be very difficult to come by as they should BUT the algorithm should be adjusted that we can’t get any additional gold stickers, especially when they can’t be traded. It’s frustrating that I have +2 of 4/5 star stickers that can’t be traded but can’t get the other ones I need. Either let us trade gold stickers or fix it to where our odds are better. Also the community chest needs to be adjusted, I have friends that have received the pink pack multiple times but every-time I open the community chest I get one key then it chooses the same key again… what the heck? There should be more events like the cakes or the cars where we can work together to get big prizes. Also every 25 or 50 boards you move up the dice amount should go up. I’m on board 132 and I still get 50 dice for every board I complete… I just feel like it should be more. I’ve also spent a lot of money on this game buying spins and coins for the peg-e game and still don’t get anywhere. I know people who haven’t spent any money on the game what so ever and are on the same level as me and have received bigger rewards than I have. Other than those things it’s a great past time.

3,2023-08-04 17:03:27,"Let’s go monopoly! It can be a great game, if you aren’t broke. Otherwise it’s a money grabber and extremely addictive, pay to win game.  And that’s fine because well, we all aren’t broke. However the lack of cards to complete the album is insane how the makers hoard it. And their paid packages are nearly worthless if they don’t provide good cards. I’m gonna stop playing the game if I don’t complete the album. It is too pricy especially if you aren’t going to get ahead.  In addition, every level increase means prices of landmarks increase. I’m currently at 40 million for an upgrade. Cmon! Atleast make prizes worth it so we can advance without paying so much money all the time. If game makers want money, cool but don’t feed off and give people more bang. Give people more major gold cards. Allow gold cards to be shared. Also their Facebook group for trading is also pretty worthless as you can’t even post and just a bunch of people who do not give back. Lastly, please stop with the awful 50 dice at every landmark past. You should increase the dice count just like you increase property cost and cash prize.   Other than that it’s a really cool game or whatever but I will lose interest just like I lost interest in Coin Blaster or whatever that game was called that’s similar to this one.",Sigh….. the lack of major cards and stickers
5,2023-09-16 16:20:08,"Okay I’ve figured at this point you all have already made up your minds on what this game needs to be or what it is currently right now monopoly is very enjoyable, regardless, if we have to spend to gain the amount of dice to earn progress, but I have to ask after progressing certain amount of net worth like, for example, the milestones wouldn’t it be fair and suffice to reward an increase of dice after passing certain net worth overtime, I understand you all want us to wait for our dice rolls for the free to play players etc to regenerate, but for people who are playing free and don’t have the money to buy rolls all the time through the shop should be able to log on every day and still benefit because as of right now the dice amount for logging on every day it’s just too low I think if the dice amount should increase that way if we waited for hours instead of getting eight rolls, every hour you should be able to earn more through logging on and saving your daily treats dice just a thought or an idea 💡 if you don’t want to change how things are now at least give us 1,000 dice on day 7 of logging on I think that would be cool for the free to play players",Daily dice needs to be increased
3,2023-11-07 03:13:32,"At first I really enjoyed it, fast paced and I was getting so many dice, I would be able to play a good 30-40 minutes. And the first 15-20 levels are not what it becomes, my screen is covered and plastered with “deals” and “special offers” I can barely see the monopoly board. And now almost an hour to get 5 dice.. basically 1 turn. You can’t defend yourself or build shields or rebuild unless you have left the game alone all day to recover your dice. Or spend money. Now I can’t even open the game to play without having to “X” out of multiple offers. 95 dice for $5 what a rip off! If you use the multiplier to actually get decent rewards that’s like 9 turns. -( In this game your number of dice is how many turns you have, but using 1 dice per turn gets you $1,000 compared to using 5-10 dice per turn to get $10-20,000 to build a town, and 1 building can cost up to 7-10 million dollars. Hence 5 dice an hour will yield you NOTHING) I was mildly obsessed with the game for 48 hours and that faded quickly into frustration and now I’m like it’s not even worth the time and effort. I went back to my old games.   So unless you want to splurge your hard earned money for 5 minutes of fun, in this economy, save your time.   I wish the developers would not be so money hungry.","Has potential, but it’s a huge money grab."
1,2023-10-31 03:20:15,"Like many others, I have been playing the monopoly go since it has launched. The game is entertaining but it continues to have glitches, a lot of times I have made purchases I have been charged twice for one offer purchase. At first I wasn’t sure because they wait days to send a receipt for your purchase that you make at the time. I have spoken with many people that have had the same problem so I have contacted  MonopolyGO about the issue and for a refund and they send me to Apple to request a refund. Even after sending in proof that I have been charged double they have continued to denied my request and email that the purchases are not eligible for a refund. I have been contacting Apple about this issue for months now and still they will not refund the money for the double purchases. They will charge for the offer that you do purchase and  for the second charge will say it is for something else. There have even been charges for days that I am 100. Percent sure that I didn’t make the purchase. This has been the worse experience I have ever had dealing with this game. If you purchase offers on this game watch you bank/credit card statements because they are stealing money and refusing to refund it. The bad part about this is I have only requested refunds for the double charges and they still refuse to refund my money.

I play this game everyday and still can’t complete them. For the rolling to build stuff like the cakes or the cars for the last one. I swear I spend more to spend it the wheels for not a good enough amount to. Like 20 chocolates to just get 80 points and it’s not easy to get chocolate. I swear you can only complete these things if you actually spend money on the game which is a no go for a lot of people. Sooner or later we’ll end up quitting because we can’t complete anything. Y’all really need to improve the rewards…. There’s no reason when I constantly spin the wheel and can’t even land on the blue pack (4 star). After a whole week worth of dailies, I only get a little bit of dice, money and a 3 star pack?!? I feel like this game is going the opposite direction that it needs to go.

5,2023-08-10 19:24:29,"I really enjoy this game. I can see some people are upset about coins however- you have to be smart about how you play and if you are, the money will stack up and you’ll get a lot more dice-rolls in no time. When I first downloaded, I started with constantly losing coins and rolls leaving me no option but to wait hours for more automaticallya but the more I played and understood, the more rewards that came to me. Trust the process because it’s a blast when you get the hang of it. The game is endless as well so I enjoy it because normally you get tired of these kind of games but it’s super entertaining as they have daily goals with rewards and challenges that you can challenge others with. I will say there are a couple of pop up’s (NO VIDEOS, JUST OFFERS THANK YOU FOR THAT) that pop up either when you run out of rolls or when you first open the app but it’s a quick exit and not really frustrating as it doesn’t randomly come up in the middle of you playing. Last but not least, I myself have put my own money into it and didn’t regret it and I don’t do that for any games so that says a lot. Everyone i’ve invited has been hooked on it. So I’d recommend!",Worth it
2,2023-09-23 02:55:40,"I love the game but it seems like the creators want people to spend all their money to get dice and stickers which have been duplicates by the way. Waiting an hour for 8 dice is crazy not to mention you can’t share with others. The game does not always land on the number rolled on the dice therefore it stops short of heist and other things on the board (such as chips for peg-e or other challenges that are taking place).  Gold cards cannot be traded but most people have multiple and cannot get the ones that are actually needed. When you chat with someone through the app it takes forever to receive correspondence and they usually end the chat with a generic statement that is sent to everyone else. Since the update stickers have gone missing and the best they can do is send 35-70 dice. I would prefer to have my 5⭐️ sticker over dice. As we progress in the game (higher levels) the amount of dice should progress as well but it does not. If I receive 50 dice when I complete level one there is absolutely no way that I should receive 50 dice at level 11,913. There are so many scammers that it is ridiculous there should be a better method to trading stickers so people do not get scammed continuously.

I finally figure out the blue packs and the two purple packs give you 5 star cards and gold cards. However for the last couple weeks I been getting duplicates. I received 1 new gold from blue in the past two weeks. Saturday I played and spend as much money as I could to win the race. Got 2nd place and out of 8 cards no new card all dups. I said ok you can’t win them all, I still have the purple pack from the daily wins. And it was the exact same. Now we’re 3 days away from the tournament being over and I’m stuck needing 2 gold card because they are not tradable. I’m going be honest, if I don’t complete this pack before then I may delete the game. Because I am willing to purchase the guarantee card bundle but you didn’t even offer that. Please fixed this before the new tournament start! I’ll even take only trading gold card after/with a certain level! Hope you find this and take note and make the proper adjustments.

3,2023-09-29 10:23:53,"The pros are it’s a decent game if you’re willing to get through the system crashes. It’s a free game but it does push you to pay for dice to continue to roll/spin to move. You’re supposed to have in game rewards like completing sticker albums gives you extra dice/money. If you played on the previous album you know that since this newer album has dropped it’s harder to get cards/stickers. The rewards are skimpy & the prices have risen. The events & tournaments do you way dirtier, it used to be easy to land on what you needed but the game algorithm changed to where now you only land on those spaces every now & then. Also there are 100% bots during those tournaments that come in last minute if you make it to 1st so you have to watch out. You’ll have a mega heist going for 15 mins & they’ll maybe give you one person to actually heist. You also have to watch out when trading cards because since the game has become so difficult to play people will now scam you out of them, some are even making others pay to get the cards they need. I do enjoy playing it so I’ll still give it 3 stars, but on the previous album I had no problem spending money on this game as to me it was more worth it, but since the new album & update I refuse it’s just not worth it to pay extra.",Pros & Cons

I absolutely love the game! The thing is.. you don’t need to spend money unless you want to get more rolls and more rolls get you more stickers and more stickers gets you more rolls. That’s okay, though, because there is a trading group on Facebook that you can join from the app to trade for stickers that you need. Unfortunately, many have been scammed from this Facebook group. I decided to join the Reddit group instead which is way more successful, but there’s one thing I am upset with. I can’t change my profile picture on MonopolyGo to hide my identity if I want to trade from Reddit. I have been trying to get in contact with customer service and an actual agent/person to talk to about changing my profile picture, but every conversation with customer service ends with, “Thanks for your feedback!”  Getting more rolls increases with your connection of Facebook, especially when you have friends continuously joining, but hiding your identity from others on the internet is non-existent because their customer service is non-existent.",Game: Yes!!

However recently I’ve noticed other players being able to shut down my landmarks consecutively without being my friend. So I’m confused because for the most part it is randomized unless they are my friend OR they are getting revenge on me for hitting them first. But today someone hit me 9 times back to back…. I just thought I’d write a review because I got so annoyed I wanted to delete my account as the person isn’t my friend so I couldn’t remove them so I just had to sit there while they kept hitting my landmark… that’s honestly ridiculous lol I was so irked enough to write a review 😂. Other than that I love the game but it gets 2 stars because I spend money on this game because I enjoyed it but as I’m writing this review that player just hit me again so that’s 10 back to back happy to share the screen shot. And also 2 stars because I play the game with my fiancé and when he had a bank heist it’ll tell him he “stole 13.4 m” yet on my end it’ll say he “just stole 24.5” an extra 10 million. I’m not sure what’s going on but I’m close to deletion it was fun while it lasted.","I love it, but"
1,2023-11-03 18:43:43,"To the guy that said complaining is like a 6 year old. Nope!! I thought this game was fun. But like most it stops getting fun. There is absolutely no skill involved. It's what the game gives you. Luck... no. Setting for the game...yes. Lost interest. Will probably delete but still have dice. Going Back to the ones that let skill and/or time are used. Also as you progress it becomes harder and they give you less. Trillions to complete board now. So succeeding is against you !! update: 10/23. This game is the very worst ever. Lost all my friends because they probably couldn't afford to keep paying money. Also never win important prizes. The creator of this game makes it boring and unplayable due to lack of dice. It's all about dice. I refuse to buy. Probably spent around 20$ max iver all Haven't bought any since I Wait until dice can be won to play. So today after I tried to play against a player I had to go through 7 players to find one that was still in the game. Slotmania was that way. Don't play it anymore. You'll make more money if your game lets people play.  Ps. Never gives you new album cards. Played everyday. Finished all daily tasks. Not one new one in three weeks. Don't get new shield skins. Read how to but not working for me. I know on ""friend"" that I am ranked way ahead of  has a newer shield than be. Totally unorganized and no good explanation on how to achieve it.",Don't like it anymore. Boring
2,2023-08-27 19:25:47,"This game, MonopolyGO, could have been a game changer but the only thing this game will change is your wallet. It’s just a shame to see the games and entertainment market at its lowest. Every game has become about ads and micro transactions, including this one.  They start the game off being just a little slow so you can learn how to play it. Then boom, you know how to play and they’re throwing all these rewards at you. They make lots of noise and use lots of pops of color to give you a good feeling inside, something to chase. Next thing you know, your dice start running out quicker, your money doesn’t buy as much as before, and you’re left wondering why you’re logging into the game more, but enjoying and receiving things less.  The thing that drives this game is Dice and how many of them you have because they are your ‘moves’. With that being said, they make the dice hard or annoying to receive. That is their biggest selling point so they are pretty strict/stingy on how they give them out. If you’ve gone through this, right now is the perfect time to delete the game. If you haven’t even played the game yet, don’t bother because right here is where people make mistakes. You either buy the dice or wait for them but know, waiting for them will never get you anywhere close to if you were to buy them",What to Expect
1,2023-07-28 13:39:39,"This game is weirdly soothing and a little fun, BUT I want to warn folks. At the start of the game, my spouse accidentally convinced me to try to use the pay to win approach for an event for a cute game token. I’m mortified to even say how much I accidentally spent, but it was an ABSURD amount combined with hard work too and still didn’t get the token. The next token was an easier goal, so I went right out of the gate working hard and using strategy… I did all the math and kept notes…. and with just a couple hundred ‘points’ to go, the spaces suddenly got harder and harder to land on the closer I got. In the end, I still forked out about $20 because I had put so much time and effort in and still not close enough with just minutes to spare. In this case, I did finally manage to get the token…. but that is just absurd. I will continue to enjoy the free aspects of them game … BUT I will not be trying for any more tokens or any goals that require a ton of time and work, and I would warn others to be prepared if you’re trying for it. I’ve always thought pay to win games were disappointing and cheap… the fact that this game goes even beyond pay to win is just plain impressive I guess? Poor customer service, glitches, and all community dynamics being super scam-prone are also pretty large challenges for this game.. especially when some aspects are 100% community-reliant.","not just pay to win, totally rigged"

They changed the purple vault from 1500 stars to 2500 stars!! That’s a huge unrealistic increase. Some people barely make it to 1500 in the whole 90 days of the current theme. Regular players have zero chance of making that goal. The only way that amount will be achieved is by spending money, and a lot of it. On top of that, we now need a gold sticker for every set meaning instead of us being able to help each other complete some of the sets the game now decides what you will complete and when. And in and even more greedy than those two things change the dice rewards for the album were cut in HALF. SMH.. I know this is a pay to play game and I pay to play but come on now you’re just overdoing it! You literally have to spend $4-500 a month to make any type of advancement in this game. That’s insane! I was already getting frustrated because there were errors that cost me dice and Monopoly money that I spent real money to get and cannot get customer service to communicate with me much less replace my losses.

I really enjoyed the fact you could control who you play with other than the options of random people in the shut downs.  I just chose not to hit random peoples boards and I guess I got lucky because not a lot hit mine.  At this point collecting rent and bank heists we’re still just people on your friends list.  Then after a while I noticed random accounts got generated on my board and I could collect rent from them.  There was no way for them to get back to my account and I couldn’t chose who I collected rent from so I just ignored it.  Bank heists we’re still friends only.  After that I started getting spammed by random account hitting me in shut downs, rent, and bank heists repeatedly in minutes completely wrecking my board.  I can’t progress any more because of this and there’s no way to remove random accounts.  Some Im sure are bots but there’s no way to report the account either.  You can’t get in contact with anyone to figure out why.    I normally don’t spend money on in game purchases and based off everything else I’ve heard I’m so glad I don’t.  From the sounds of it they’re double charging, making unauthorized purchases, not giving rewards, etc and there’s no way to contact anyone to resolve those either.

3,2023-07-26 17:50:01,"Initially this game has a fun factor, largely due to its namesake and history, but the long hold of enjoyment just isn’t there. Blasting through the initial levels brings a sense of accomplishment but towards the middle to upper tiers that enjoyable wanes. Yes, I’m convinced spending actual money is required however still seemingly unfruitful as a player is lottery odds capable of drawing cards of actual use. There is a Facebook group of “traders” however it is unregulated and trades are completed at your own risk. Read the multiple posts a day detailing how players were scammed by a fellow trader and the whole group is constantly on a heightened level of anxious untrustworthiness. Trades are definitely possible however nearly everyone is looking for the exact two or three cards, always. A simple agreement to trade feature seems simple enough to establish to filter out all the bad actors. The gameplay is simple of course and some of the animations make it entertaining but not sustaining.  Overall, fun for a week but it will soon grow tiresome. I’ll keep it on my phone since I’ve already been through weeks of playing and spending some money but have no intention of spending a penny more nor give the game any more of my time than what’s needed to collect the daily freebies.",Fun for a while
3,2023-10-16 14:58:29,"1) The game is full of computer generated players in the tournaments that go from 100 points to 6,000 points in less than 10 minutes. The game is designed to keep real players from winning tournaments or even placing in the top 5 unless they spend a lot of money buying rolls. 1st place prize is 2500 rolls but what’s the point when you have to use two and three times more than that to win it?? 2) Completing the sticker albums isn’t even a challenge because the game decides what to give you. A weeks worth of playing gets you 200 duplicates and maybe 2-3 new stickers. Trading in 100 duplicates gets you 20 rolls and another pack of duplicate stickers 🙄 3) The mini individual tournament things are also ridiculously unattainable unless you buy more rolls and can use the 10x-50x per roll - I love a game that’s a challenge but there’s no challenge in playing against bots or people who have plenty of money to buy thousands of rolls. I really enjoyed the game at first because the first few tournaments I was able to place in the top 10 but it seems like the longer you play the less you win. If you have money to put into the game then it’ll be fun for you to play. If you like a game that’s a challenge and is actually fair play then this isn’t it",Too many bots
3,2023-09-28 17:02:12,"Im about ready to stop playing this game.   1. Why is it that random people not on my friends list can rob me and take millions of dollars in bank heists but I can only do bank heists with the people on my friends list?    2. I understand it's not supposed to be easy but at this point I am repeatedly receiving the same stickers while not getting any golds or new stickers in general and if I do randomly get a gold after 10 years, it's a gold I already have. We barely get dice. We need dice to win more dice. We need dice to win tournaments and get more rewards. At this point if you're not getting rewards for playing or growing your sticker album why play? Why are there only bank heists? Maybe start making a dice heists/mega dice heists. Maybe give ppl the option to trade/gift dice with friends like we can stickers. Why can't we trade gold cards? Maybe 1 gold trade can take up your 5 trades for the day. Why did the cost of stars become so high to open the pink vault yet the dice we receive when completing a sticker album got lower. We're already dealing with the inflation of prices in real life. Monopoly is supposed to be our escape, it shouldn't feel as crappy as the real world. The game could be great, pls work on making it better.",Stop giving us the same stickers!
1,2023-10-09 21:38:42,"This game is infuriating. The partner events are insane. They barely give you anything of what you need and when you give you enough the wheel is so insane. If I have to get 50,000 of whatever to complete the event on four different stages then why is their 40-80 points on their. That’s so stupid and dumb in my opinion. It was since at first but I regret recommending it to everybody who I did recommend it to. The prizes don’t even correlate with how much time and effort you have to put into this game. Why does 6,000 tokens equal to 900 dice that doesn’t even make sense. The money you spend on the game is unfair. I pay 2$ for 30 dice that may get me at most 10 million and wasted money. The odds are insane. Ive been getting knock down back to back literally 13 times in a row no bank heists at all. All I need to do is complete a task and do a bank heist and the game is purposely giving me no bank heist so I don’t complete the task. As the level goes up the prizes should go up if I am at a level 100 there is no reason why that equates to 20 million and 50 dice, their is absolutely nothing Incan do with that.

3,2023-11-11 00:00:33,"It was okay in the beginning and then the grind and design is just annoying. There should be increasing max dice and dice refresh to go with increased leveling up. There should be chance cards that send you to the corners. There should be in-game messaging. Some people don’t use fb and discord is terrible trying to sort through that mess. Sticker drop rates are terrible. I’m saving up for 2500 stars and its taking forever and I’m sure it won’t help me finish the albums. Targeting friends in shutdowns is not a fun feature. If I was designing the game, shutdowns/heists would have been more so a strategy for events. Targeting people within a certain range in the leaderboard from you would pay out bigger rewards for successful attacks. Pay to win is obvious and its fine but the being bombarded with purchase ads is super annoying. If someone wants to pay to win, trust they will find it. The game is all chance really so even fixing those concerns doesn’t keep players around for a long time I’d imagine. Grinding/farming/looting type games need skill/strategy and/or great social interaction for players to stick around for a long time. Those areas are lacking in my opinion. I’ll be done soon.

2,2023-08-13 06:11:58,"This is a great game. Most people love Monopoly anyways, so being able to play against friends is extremely fun. Unfortunately, it seems like we’re not just playing against friends. I find it odd that when you get a lot of money stored up, some random player steals most of it & there is no way to take revenge. For example: I played for about an hour & was able to save up hundreds of millions of dollars. I stop playing for a few hours only to receive a notification saying some player I’ve never heard of has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars. I log in to play after seeing this, but I can’t even pull this player up on my list to get revenge. This player NEVER interacts with me again after this. This happens ALL the time! You save up money & within a few hours of taking a break from the game, a random player, you don’t even know, steals most of your money. I’m really believing it’s rigged! Not sure if this is your way of getting people to spend real money or not, but it’s very frustrating. I’m at the point now where I want to just delete the game. It’s not fun playing when the game is set up so unfairly. Either make it fair, or people will stop playing. It might be extremely popular right now, but people will catch on to what you’re doing.

Also there is a glitch causing people to get attacked dozens of times by the same player in an impossible amount of time. I have reached out to customer service on both issues only to never hear anything back. The developers and made things more and more expensive and don’t care that people are getting screwed by their game. Avoid like the plague!!   Updated: The game has actually gotten worse. Glitches and cheaters control the game. You can’t even compete unless you spend loads of money. People create fake dice and use airplane mode on their phones to hack the game along with various other manipulations and cheats. They talk openly about it on the social media groups yet nothing is ever done about it. Cheaters force people to spend loads of money to compete so I’m sure the developers approve. Customer service is non existent, the social media group admins are the same. If you attempt to trade anything in the main group you will more than likely get scammed unless you check a persons history.

When you file a report to the support team it’s  always a virtually automated response in which you leave an email for further contact and I have put in 5 concerning my issues but no one ever responds back. They draw you in to spend money to try to be the game only to still give you the same amount of dice no matter what level you made in which most games when you level up give you more dice in which is necessary because they realize it’s almost unrealistic to win with just 50 dice. They don’t listen to the players and don’t care. If I could suggest anything don’t play this game Candy Crush is more attainable in leveling up and doesn’t make you spend money to meet the goal just to sabotage the game.

The mini events that are held every day and weekly add more excitement to the game as you’re able to win more prizes. The only issue that I have is that a lot of the times when I roll I will keep landing on the same spot with nothing on it and it becomes frustrating and feels like a waste of dice especially when you’re waiting hours for it to reload. Also a huge problem I have is that I’ve invested money into this game for dice and other deal packages and it’s not worth it at all..I might as well wait for my dice to reload. If you’re gonna have people willing to spend money on dice or other things, the rolls after should be landing on most if not all of the spaces with things to collect to get someone’s money worth. I can spend $10 for dice and not get ANY collectibles and it’s just a waste of money. I recommend NOT spending money in this game it’s definitely not worth the purchase.

3,2023-07-30 18:13:40,"This game could be so much more. I absolutely love the monopoly board game and this is a fantastic, modern way to play it. But there are some serious flaws with the stickers. First of all you all ENCOURAGE people to join the Facebook group to trade for stickers, however you fail to put in parameters in place to keep dishonest people from scamming other users. This is ridiculous. Secondly you give multiple of the same stickers over and over without giving out new stickers no matter how often or how much a player play. This is discouraging. You all need to check the algorithm because there is no reason why I have over 20 of the same card when I need other cards. You all should also consider a built in feature in the app to allow players to chat and trade cards without having to go to Facebook. If people want to trade cards the cards should go into some kind of vault or cloud space until both people have sent their cards and both people have confirmed the cards they received to be the right card.   And by the way the baking game was great!!! It would have been better if you could talk with the people you were playing with to encourage them to do their part. Again a chat feature would be great.",Aggravated
2,2023-07-16 22:24:34,"Im becoming so over this game it’s ridiculous. The roll retention per hour is nowhere near enough, the roll’s received upon completing a board should be much higher especially for the higher levels, the amount of duplicates you consistently receive is outrageous and the rule of not being able to trade golds is ridiculous also. Even if you cant trade the golds why not have a special vault strictly for golds that way you are at least guaranteed more golds. The game is very rigged and cheats a lot. The count is off almost all the time, the wheel boost purposefully skips over the good spin it should land on only to give a smaller more simple price which is nothing but a tactic to make you spin money, the game occasionally glitches and even when it does no one person gets the same rewards for the games mishaps and when you do break down and choose to by dice the game double charges and only gives 1 reward even though you were charged for 2 and lets not discuss the trade count. 5 trades per 24hrs is nowhere near enough for millions that play this game. There needs to be some kind of trading system created that upon sending a sticker it allows both parties to view and accept before the final send to cut back on people being scammed out of stickers they have earned and/or paid for",Game Issues
3,2023-10-23 11:06:25,i dont know if real people read these but if they do I just want to say I love this game I’ve been playing consultantly for 3 months now but I just want to make a suggestion that you guys don’t promote a Facebook group for trading stickers and maybe consider another app for it instead kinda like Pokémon gos deprecate app for trading Pokémon. Your group is practically all scammers at this point and all of the hard work of getting high star cards goes away the same second they decide to press the block button and the admins are enabling this. After being blocked I got reported and my posts got suspended so I couldn’t even warn people about the person who scammed me to make sure they get removed and it doesn’t keep happening. As much as I love this game the community is toxic and with how difficult it is to get 5 star cards already without paying i dont even think I’ll be able to finish my album and its really turning me away from this game along with many other players. I’m not the type of person to leave reviews ever but this game is very fun and successful and I really felt that it was nessicary that I said something.

3,2023-09-22 17:01:09,"I loved playing this game until they reworked everything, the dice 5m reward is useless it wastes all your dice and they changed the sticker system and made it extremely hard to get new stickers compared to getting 4 and 5 star stickers regularly to help with the 100 sticker star album exchange, in the community chest it used to be every present on the board had a gold coin now they have 5 dice or a couple million and always lands on the keys and I’ve never gotten a 50x since the beginning, the M machine where you drop the tokens is super rigged now can barely even complete one bumper the tokens just sink to the hard left or hard right every time, I’m a big fan of hasbro but all these changes are making the game less enjoyable, please make it more fair towards the player, I get it’s a new game and it’s going to change but it’s not fun opening 50 sticker packs and not getting a single new one at all, failing on every challenge for example in the daily event that lasts 2 days I’ll always get very close to getting a big dice reward but never enough points even though I log in 2 times a day sometimes 3, this game is not gambling we should not have to dump in large amounts of real money to see any success",Used to be great

1,2023-10-15 14:29:55,"Started playing this game because family got excited to play and wanted partners. We played and got excited about the gameplay. Then everything stopped. No more dice, no more stickers, no more fun. Just a daily grind for no discernible goal. We are all about to quit playing. I gave the rating I did because there was a game that built cars and that was a great idea. And as long as the game progressed in a reasonable manner I played. But it slowed and got boring. Note to devs: There is no way I am spending money for a maybe chance on stickers especially not after the poor showing of the packets I have played. There is no way I am spending real money for minimum rewards like 50 dice for two dollars. Get real. I play and pay better games than this. DO NOT PAY FOR CARDS! Biggest ripoff of the game. If you notice I did upgrade the game from a three to a four but that is because it is fun as long as you do not depend on the game dynamics. If you can build a great game group and dynamic then the game is good but if not well let me put it this way… spend your time and money elsewhere.  Final edit: Seriously if you are addicted to playing losing slots then this game is for you. I have seen so many hopeful players quit halfway into the game. Don’t bother paying money because there is no hope of winning anything. And even if you do win, it is an illusion.",Fun then not
4,2023-10-20 02:05:05,I’ve been playing the game for awhile now it’s fun i like it would give it 5 stars but there’s a few things i don’t really understand stand.  1. so every hour you get a certain amount of rolls until your rolls are full we’ll say you don’t use all your rolls and you have say 80 as your max and you stopped playing and left the game with 75/80 rolls now your hour timer has already started once you hit 79 you come back in an hour and your rolls are full 80/80 but you’re supposed to get 8 rolls every hour so when i come back in that hour i should have 83/80 rolls right?  2. when you complete a board your prize money goes up but your dice doesn’t it stays at 50 & i feel like the higher the level the rolls should keep going up. prices on builds and the amount to get out of jail keeps going up the amount of dice you get for completing a level should too.  3. there’s a sticker game that’s actually fun the only downside is they give you the same cards over and over and over again yes you can trade them but i can’t complete the missions if we can’t trade gold cards & we keep getting the same cards over & over again.,Thank you.
3,2023-11-07 23:24:14,"It’s a great twist on a classic game however, there are some issues with this game. Sometimes friends appear missing in the friends bar which is minor. More importantly though is the amount of money people spend for cards to complete sets. I’ve seen people spend hundreds of dollars just for duplicate cards it’s ridiculous. The average person doesn’t even have much to spend nowadays to complete sets. The trading option is nice but the limit is 5 per day. Then the rolls that you get capped at is not enough. I am almost at 6,000 star level on board 165 and my 80 rolls max can’t even build up my buildings no more with what I get back. Then when I come back after gaining more rolls i am bankrupt. The star level progression is fun but gets boring when all you want i rolls and it only gives you 3mill which isn’t even enough to build anything not even fix a building it’s ridiculous. The game needs either an increased roll cap or more rolls per hour back maybe both to even make it fun or playable. It’s hard to upgrade your board for what you get. The stickers are fun but a joke because finishing the album is impossible and getting cards to even fill up the fault is a joke.",Love the concept but terrible play
3,2023-08-10 00:10:24,"I came to check out reviews to see if my concerns might change the further I get but doesn’t look like it. I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of money on this because I felt like I was so close I HAD to keep going on the events for prizes & stuff. I really agree with everyone about the fact that the further along you get the more expensive it gets to pass the levels so why don’t the rewards increase too? Insane to get only 50 dice each level up every single time. Not to mention the rewards altogether just don’t add up & it just seems to be intentional for a money grab. Like y’all aren’t making enough already!!? I too kept wondering why it was giving so many cards but barely any new ones EVER making it impossible to reach the goal. Plus to trade any out you get crap rewards again. I won’t even try the Facebook group because of the reviews here. It gets monotonous anyway. The same every level. It’s a great game when you start out but I can’t justify spending loads of money on a game just to be in the same spot really. Make the rewards worth it, the higher you get & on the events 1200 to get 1st place is lame. I’m gonna have to move on I think. I did enjoy while it lasted though!",I WAS really enjoying but..
4,2023-08-19 23:11:13,"I give the game a 4 out of 5 stars. The game itself is fun, addicting, inviting, etc. the only problem is the constant scamming everyone is going through for mostly 5 star cards. I’m in multiple monopoly go trading groups and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve came across so many scammers. Not just myself but so many others. It takes the fun out of the game when you think genuine people are trying to help with the last card of your set but they insist you trade first just for that persons to block you and you lose a card that could’ve been given to someone that would’ve traded with you for the last card you needed. There should be a trading verification from both parties. Where you both have to accept the card to trade. If someone doesn’t accept the trade then it cancels. It’s fair on both parties and no one gets scammed. Just throwing an idea out there for future update. I love the game but why tell players to join a monopoly go group on Facebook when there is no way to get rid of scammers in the game itself. Please make this happen. I’m speaking in behave of sooo many people. It would be greatly, no immensely appreciated.",Scammers!
2,2023-09-13 19:18:05,"So, I’ll start with the obvious, this game is addicting. Anyone who has played it can attest to that. Actually I only downloaded it so my girlfriend could get the referral bonuses; now I’m on board 24 and open the app any chance I get. However, there are issues I have with the game. EVERY TIME I run out of rolls it bombards me with 3 or 4 and sometimes 5 pay walls to buy more rolls. It’s to the point now that muscle memory kicks in and I can exit out of each of them without even looking, but it’s aggravating, especially when you land on a shield, exit out of the pay walls and then you get to roll again, because those extra shields give back your rolls, and you get hit AGAIN with pay walls. It annoys me in a way I can’t describe. I get that I can buy rolls, it isn’t something I forget a day after I start playing. I wish there was a way to turn these off, the stores to buy rolls border your screen at all times, just leave it at that and call it a day.   ALSO FOR EVERYONE WHO PLAYS THIS GAME, go into your settings and opt out of them selling your information. It’s tricky because it says “opt in” and the slider bar is set to off, so you think you’re good until you read the small print below. You have to tap the slider bar and it’ll read “opted out.”",Great game but needs work
3,2023-11-10 17:01:57,"I have played this game every day consistently since I have downloaded it I have even spent money on this game which I have never done before with any game that I’ve downloaded and I truly enjoy playing this game however, what I don’t enjoy is feeling like I’m being hustled, and when the fun is being taken out of the game. One of the purposes is to complete albums and get these cards and it used to be fun to swap out cards and get new card packages and get new cards or gold pieces. However, I haven’t gotten a new card in almost 2 months and I can’t swap with anybody cause they haven’t gotten any new cards just the same or Pete cards over and over and over again, there’s not enough games within the games anymore not enough ways for you to get new tokens or new skins for shields. I don’t know do you love the game still I’m still actively playing but you need to do better with these cards or just don’t have them at all like there’s a whole Facebook to trade out cards but that’s not even fine I don’t know, looking for some improvements since I’ve invested my money into this game I will stick around for a little while longer to see if anything improves",Over It soo Wanted to give it 5 stars
2,2023-10-03 18:50:32,"This game was fun for about a month and then became an endless waiting game.   Takes at least a month to get a new sticker unless you spend money, events end way too early making it impossible to get any milestone or gifts from the event unless you spent money, inconsistencies with rolls and board rewards; some days you land on every reward some days you land on just cash, some days you land on specifically community chest boxes which give nothing up front, some days you can’t land on corner squares if there’s an event associated with it, same with any other square with an event associated with it. Noticeably all of these go away or stop as you spend more IRL money.   The entire game is designed around making you want to spend money, landing you 1-2 squares before a reward with no rolls left, or giving you duplicates of stickers for weeks but suddenly buying something with a sticker pack not even guaranteed to have anything will drop the exact sticker you needed, or at worst destroying the competition with 2-3 purchases and targeting 1 player. It becomes monotonous to log on to see another event you can’t win in with a sticker pack you won’t get the last card for, all while your rolls feel wasted on the game forcing you on useless squares.",Started off differently
3,2023-10-01 13:58:14,Although I play daily it seem to be better in the beginning now it cost so much to complete your buildings . I’ve also have had issues with the sticker rewards where I completed the stickers and not get my rewards. I sent in to customer service but they instead of giving the reward I earned they sent me like 20 dice and it happened multiple times . 20 dice when I should have been given at least 500 or so … and how they want you to send a picture is dumb because someone can’t send a picture to show if we can’t rewind and show everything so dumb … oh and by the way it’s going extremely slow today lagging I dont know why first time doing this. All my other apps are going fast so it’s not my connection it’s monopoly  Update they did finally give me 200 for one of the sticker books I completed but still not for the other one …. I have also noticed that once you get to a certain level you rarely get a NEW sticker I haven’t gotten a new sticker in like a week it’s annoying. It’s almost impossible to complete any books without a new sticker book . In the beginning the game was great it was fun and got addictive but now it’s not as fun anymore,I like the game I play daily
1,2023-06-01 23:06:59,"This game is a sad knock off of another IOS game that has been around for years. MonopolyGO! Is plagued with pop ups asking you to spend money. As soon as you are out of rolls they waste no time asking for your money with 3 pop ups. Every. Time. This is a pathetic attempt trying to coast off of the success of Board Kings which has been around for a long time. No premium currency to be earned in game to exchange for rolls or rewards, countless pop ups making it genuinely annoying to even attempt playing the game. As a life long Monopoly fan and avid player I am disgusted to even say I tried this game. Could not be more obvious about stealing the ideas from Board Kings and slapping a Monopoly logo on top. Even the events are literal reskins of events in the other game. There was O effort put into developing this game and it is a sad attempt at coercing money out of the pockets of players. It's boring, repetitive, and unoriginal. Unfortunately it's a free game and there is no way to get back the time I wasted hitting the install button, otherwise I would. Please do not waste your time on this, there is another much better game that has been running since I was still using my iPhone 5 and is actively being updated. Give the credit and your time to the developers that deserve it, not ""Great Value"" developers like this.",Most obvious knock off I’ve seen

Also there are hackers and I’m worried they hacking the game and stealing dice to sell errors keep coming up when you try to collect dice or money I got the mega bank heist and won 48 Million when I hit the collect an error note came up and I didn’t get my winning money it keeps happening and my money isn’t collecting and it is using my dice up You should not have to constantly buy dice you are making a fortune off innocent people who want to play the game Then there are those on Facebook or Instagram who want you to buy dice for outrageous amounts of money and when you say know they badger you. Your gifting should be free not just 80 dice. That’s why people quit also I have gone around the board 20 or 40 times and don’t get rewards.

Go ahead and roll so we can do it all again. There's been times this will happen 3-4 times in a row and it gets FRUSTRATING. Then there are certain stickers you need which they simply will not give you unless you pay. You'll end up with 10+ duplicates of everything else just because they refuse to give you what you need. Why? They want you to pay money for it. They reduced the amount of free dice you get from Facebook friends from 10k to a measly 1,000. Why? They want you to pay for more dice instead. Sure, the alternative is wait hours and hours for a few dice so you can actually play the game again but who wants to do that? They also have TONS of bots. Most of your interactions are bots. The people on the tournament leaderboards are mostly bots. Spend a week to get 200 million dollars?

The higher you are, 80 dice will get you no where and waiting an hour for 8 dice is utterIy ridiculous. I think when your net worth is more than 5000 you should gain another 20 dice. There are really not enough options in winning any gold cards. They want you to spend money to get these sticker packs and the prices are absurd!!! The fact that you can get multiple gold cards and can’t trade them is also ridiculous.  Where I drew the line in playing this game is when I finally, after days, won a gold card to complete a set, I never received my rewards for completing it. I reported it several times and never got any response. Also filed a claim and again….no response 🦗🦗. If you are gonna totally ignore people, then why should I put any effort into this game anymore. I also think it’s beyond ridiculous that you have to “request” to delete the game, like seriously??!?! WHY????? And the questions you have to answer are stupid. Just delete my account with no questions asked.  I was gonna give this game a chance but being totally ignored on a claim is what broke the camels back.",Was great in the beginning but lost interest

I mean at least give us a new card every time we complete a board. Then having to wait an hour for 7 dice is ridiculous. I miss out on winning events. The only way to win is buying more dice and I feel like since I’m spending my hard earned money on a game I should be getting more than 200 dice. Some times I feel like the game is cheating too. I had my multiplier on x20 and I was only given 5-10 cookies. How and I supposed to even get close to winning if I’m not getting the appropriate amount or you want more cookies for x1 spin.   Trading cards is rigged. You got players who scam you out of cards by not sending you a card or lying saying they have it if you give them the card they need.  Also landmarks get more expensive every level you go up but you’re barely given enough dice. Low multiplier = low money but keeps your dice at a reasonable level. High multiplier = lots of money just to get your landmarks to level 3 build but then no dice left.

But there are some shady things they do, that kind of ruin the game, and make me not want to spend any money on it, just in spite.  Why with the gold cards?? Why let us get duplicates of cards we cannot trade.  And the recent downgrade of rewards is disappointing.  I imagine even more so for those that spend money and get nothing.  In this game, there is luck and then there is Monopoly Go luck.  Most stops on a railroad are shutdowns, unless you need a shut to get an achievement.  Then you will hit 3-4 heists in a row.  New tournament that requires you to land on the four corner squares?  Let’s go, because I land on those all the time.  Except now I don’t, because that is what I need.  I just need one more card to complete a set.  I will never get it.   Another thing I noticed is that the money isn’t the same between players.  My friend “stole” money from me in a heist.  She got $706k, but on my side it says she got $5 million.  I assume they are “adjusting” it due to our playing levels, but come on.

Sadly that’s not the case anymore. From limited dice rolls and money it’s nearly impossible to to advance to the next board within a reasonable time frame. All this game does is shove advertisements down your throat, and make sure you land on a tax tile or jail (where you have to roll doubles to make it out or if not you get taxed a lot of money in the game). I don’t think I would ever recommend this game to anyone, why would I want to waste their time with this. I don’t understand why I’m getting the same cards that I’ve already achieved when I have 5 decks that don’t have cards at all. They do have cool game events where you can have a chance (if your lucky) to win perks but let’s not forget you have to wait a WHOLE HOUR in order to get 7 rolls.

Unfortunately the recent changes have ruined what was a great game and have made it almost unplayable and certainly not a game I will spend any more money on.   The card odds are significantly worse, the wheel boost odds are horrible to the point it’s useless. I have spun it 50+ times since album rollout and consistently land on the not only the exact same tile over and over but it does not land on the “better” rewards at all. Previously you could get a decent prize every ten spins or so but at this point it’s laughable and insulting to get nothing. The album rewards are so much lower than the prior albums. Scopely said it’s because it’s “easier” to complete. This is false information. The card odds are worse, the wheel boost odds are worse. It is not easier to complete. It’s significantly worse. I was spending money previously on dice and sticker packs but I will no longer do so as the fun of the game is completely gone.

From there, it was addicting and fun at first, but as my net worth got higher, the more and more I saw that the game became frustrating and more pay to win. The rolls are capped off at 80 and unless you spend money, you have to wait for the same amount of rolls after the 80 cap point. The old album had better awards then the new current one, the dice awards are horrible, there are still scammers on the official Facebook page THEY ADVERTISE, and on top of the Developers obviously not caring about their player base and letting bugs and issues plague the game.   There is no end game, there is just retextured levels and little to no reward as you advance. The game is designed to make you spend to advance, and you can be prone to losing your account at any point simply because the developers didn’t test out the partner events and you can’t even recover your account once it’s lost. The final straw for me was when they brought down the cap for Facebook friends from 10k to 1k to make sure players can’t get more dice for free, forcing them to have to buy dice.

Another thing, I think we should be able to trade the gold cards. We get duplicates of those, we should be able to trade them. Not everyone can afford or wants to spend money on the game to try and get those higher starred cards and it very frustrating. Also, on the baking event, I had a partner that barely helped at all and it was due to that that I missed out on my last cake. If I had had more dice and could have gotten more macaroons or if she would have helped out, then I would have completed the event. It is definitely frustrating, so I think you should be able to remove a partner and get another one during these types of events, because it’s just not fair that one person does all or most of the work and then still miss out because the partner didn’t help or we just couldn’t get the dice fast enough without spending money to buy it.

I keep getting the same ones over and over again; even the chance with five star which is rare.  I still get cards that I already have.  I’m getting tired of getting number 1 in the game on the events which again is maybe one time is a month span, then receiving the the 5 starred card I already have.  I try and trade but everybody else needs basically the same cards it feels like so I do not even have a chance with getting them.  There are so many fake dice collecting things that are in the monoplane go groups on Facebook.  I am not going to have my phone get hacked or anything by those things.

She has contacted support many times and they keep telling her the issue is fixed even though nothing has been fixed. Now when she completes the new albums she doesn’t receive any dice or rewards. Another issue is you can tell how rigged it is. For example when you spin prize wheels sometimes it spins and stops normal and other times it spins and slowly passes a good prize that it should have stopped on and clicks to the next much lower prize. The amount of dice you win for completing “stuff” is ridiculous also. Of course they want you to get hooked to spend money on buying dice and other items. But even if we’re to purchase, the cost is ridiculous for what you get. There’s other frustrating issues but not going to spend any more time writing about them. You’ll see… One more thing… the only real way to get all the stickers you’ll need to complete a set is to trade with people.

You can’t trade gold stickers and yet those seem to be the ones you get the most dupes of. They say it’s because it’s supposed to be like a little incentive for you to keep but what is the point in that? Once the album is expired, the stickers all go away. You have a certain amount of time to complete challenges but only get 8 dice every hour which is never enough to get anywhere in the challenges. Half the time you land on a tile with a token and you don’t even get said token. And don’t get me started on their official discord server. Absolute mad house fully of catty and childish behavior from members and mods on a power trip showing a lot of favoritism towards members by allowing them to act a certain way while banning or timing out others for the same thing.

Now this game has become primarily a pay to win game if you want to achieve anything. After this season with the stickers I think I’m going to walk away as it isn’t fun anymore.   (Out of the multitude of times I have triggered them) The wheel has only landed on the gold M pack once  so far this entire season and when it did it was only repeats. On wheel boosts I have never managed to get it to land on anything more than an orange pack with repeat stickers. Whenever I am getting low on dice, but I am also getting close to completing a tier level for an event I have noticed the game begins to land on zones that have no value to me whatsoever until I run out of dice (it did this once and left me needing just 3 points to reach the next tier with only an hour or two left in the event) obviously out of frustration of wanting to obtain those extra 3 points I put a couple bucks in. (Great marketing strategy by the way). And let’s not even begin with the obvious…the inability to obtain stickers, specifically gold stickers, this season.

3,2023-11-02 02:12:29,This game is fun but what makes me not want to play is being attacked multiple times within an hour from one single player. I shouldn’t have all my shields and all my money taken by one player. It doesn’t makes sense nor is it fair especially if you actually put money into the group. I have a particular player who in an hour will shutdown my landmarks (with 5 full shields) and get me in heists multiple times. I don’t know the person nor are they on my friends list. I can’t for the life find out how is that even possible considering I can only attack them ONCE in a 24 hour period. I’ve tried reaching out to customer support but of course you can’t even reach a real person and it sends you into loops. Searching online shows it’s a real problem and the game owners aren’t really trying to give an answer or trying to fix it. I become very discouraged and have been close to deleting. I just don’t try as hard because why bother everything will be taken the second I log off. If there was an option to block everyone and anyone (not just remove your friends) then it would get a better rating.,Fun but the constant attacks from a single player

Your algorithm is set to let us land on the tiles we need once an hour apparently! Those bots you don’t have are showing out in the competitions.. when they have over 25,000 pts and the person in 2nd place has 8000… you want to make it even for the payers and the non payers.. some people have multiple 5star cards and then others have none.. fyi that’s not fair across the board.. 8 dice an hour is ridiculous!!! When to get anywhere you need to be rolling at x50 or better yet x100. I’m at board 313 you know how many dice i get for finishing a board.. 50 😒… you know how many dice i got for finishing board 5? 🤨 50.. your math ain’t mathin my man.. you got some major adjusting to do if you wanna keep your players and all that money rolling in cause the rate your going that money is gonna quit rolling in to you soon… then it’s gonna be too late..",Do BETTER MR.

3,2023-08-25 11:50:28,The game monopoly is fun I’ve always love the board game and when I saw it on the app was happy to lay and it’s a good game but it has. A lot of bugs there seems to be a new update for it that swear it fixes the bugs but it doesn’t . The sticker challenges are unreal they only way you finish most is if you buy the packs and the fact that you can open multiple and get the same cards over and over and I don’t understand why we get extra gold card that we can’t share I feel you should be able to share at least one gold card a day and should stop getting multiple of the same ones if you have got the new ones and saving up the stickers to buy a safe doesn’t help because half of the time u don’t get a new sticker just the the weekly goals yoj complete to get the purple pack of stickers and get ten stickers in the pack and none of them be new ones and it’s always glitching when ur winning prizes or goes at when your supposed to recieved them and you don’t have I’ve had to contact my bank for in authorized charges if I buy my bundle some how I get charged twice when I only bought it once please do better still love the game,This game needs better
2,2023-09-25 03:52:09,"The game itself is fun and addictive.. although the lack of dice they give you for free is absurd. The developers want you to spend money. The competitions to get rewards that change daily give you tokens depending on what space you land on, you never land on the spaces during that competition and then once it changes you always land on those spaces. They constantly give you the same sticker packs so it’s impossible to complete a sticker pack to gain more money or dice. Then once you level up to higher level boards it costs so much to finish properties it’s almost impossible. The game has the potential to be so good but only getting 5-8 dice an hour for free and getting close to nothing for it without spending real money is not enough. They just want you to continue to spend your real money on the game with the hopes you get more dice to inevitably get close to nothing in return… on top of all of this, the community is rigged and have people selling dice online and scamming people for dice. The sticker trading group is always getting scammed and nobody wants to help anyone to complete packs. Honestly considering quitting playing all together when I loved it when I started playing. It’s a shame honestly. It’s supposed to be fun.",Fun but rigged
1,2023-09-20 20:53:22,"I have been playing this game for months, as well as my 6 year old daughter, on my account. When all of a sudden I realized I had charged racking up like crazy. I watched my daughter play one day and saw her go in a buy a pack, I’ll take partial credit as I did put her facial recognition on my phone in the event of emergency, but never thought about the fact that she could be paying for stuff. I also have no idea how my credit card got linked to my account and when I did try to find a card it only gave me my debit card information. So after many hours of trying to figure this out, I finally was able to delete the correct card so no charges could be made anymore. And of course, I disputed the charges as I had not agreed to them. In the mean time still going about my life playing the game whenever I had time, no problems. Then this morning, the first time I have tried to play since my dispute cleared, my account has been disabled. I literally got kicked out of the game and it will no longer let me update or log in again to start over, simply because I disputed charges that were not authorized by myself. For a game who has generated so much money in so little time, you sure are more money hungry than any other person or game I have ever come across.",Money hungry
1,2023-09-15 18:26:43,"Funny, exciting game will hold your attention very well. It’s a great twist to the original board game monopoly. From how they have a lot of the monopoly boards. To the collection of stickers for more dice, and mini games are very creative and fun like the car builder that just passed was a hit for my group of friends. Sadly, like most app games that are pay to play. There are some every day user issues, 80 dice and seven added back every hour is not enough to keep people playing it consistently throughout the day. •Stickers when you have almost filled up most books, get incredibly hard to find and you can get multiple same golds that have no value after you get your first one. •Also I have tried to formulate the cost of these buyable packs, and I don’t really understand the math. I just don’t see the “deals” to spend real money. Why would I buy a pack and not be guaranteed a new sticker? I’ve only seen that on one purchasable pack with stickers for 19 dollars.  Update:  Just seems the longer this ages the more I’m falling out of love with the game. New sticker packs have less dice rewards. Now gold cards are given at a lower rate and I’ve got doubles that are meaningless. App was apart of my morning wake up routine now I’m forgetting or passing on it.",Less money grab. More Content
5,2023-08-20 21:03:15,"Thai game is by far my favorite game right now. But there are a few things I’d like to see change and be added. Like the dice, why do we have to wait a whole hour for only 8 dice. Why not make it like 10-20.. it’s insane. Also when you get a sticker pack you should be more opt to getting a new card and also there should be a way to exchange stickers, like the duplicates. I know there’s the safe but they need a new way like take some duplicates and trade then for a card you need each week have different available cards you can trade for and also have like a weekly monthly package thing where you can subscribe for more dice and sticker packs. Also I think they should add like a thing for the events when you have to land on the certain spot to get the flags or whatever, and make like a frenzy that lasts for 2-5 minutes where was a spot you land you get the tokens needed for the event. Just some thoughts that I think would make this game even better!! Overall this game is amazing!!",I absolutely love this game.. but it needs some new additions
3,2023-10-22 01:20:42,"Games needs a little revamping.  Why does rolling after hitting doubles take away from the number of rolls you have?  Rolling doubles was always a roll-again before the next player on the board version.  Why not make it a free roll?  Community Chest.  Landing on this is nothing but “we’re gonna take a small percent of your money and throw it into this ever increasing jackpot that you can never win unless you play with a group.”  How about disabling that unless there is a group.  Better yet, (I’m sure some people may agree with me on this) use the universal unwritten rule of free parking.  Single players get the jackpot if they land on free parking.  Support:  Nothing in the contact support to actually contact support.  It is nothing more than a pre-made up QnA.  Just don’t ask anything specific.  Oh no.  They only want you to ask the question they’ve already got listed.  Basically ask us anything you want as long as it’s the question WE want you to ask.  Want to make a suggestion.

2,2023-09-29 21:03:56,"It was fun playing at first, but it’s gotten frustrating and not worth playing anymore. They get you because it’s addicting. The last sticker album event people were completing the albums multiple times. I barely completed it once before the event was over. I even bought dice a number of times.🤦‍♀️ This round they’ve made everything more difficult and frustrating. We haven’t been able to trade gold stickers, but this time every sticker set has one and they’re not at all easy to come by. And I don’t know how long it’s been since I’ve even gotten a new sticker! They’re all duplicates! No matter if it’s an event reward or a daily reward. Dice rewards are lower with the sets. It costs more stars to trade in stickers for the safe. Last event, the pink safe cost 1500 stars, this time it’s 2500. I feel like they change the group I’m playing in for the shutdown/bank heist events. I’ll be in the top 10 and currently playing and next thing I know I’m ranked in the 20’s and there’s different names all above. Every now and then I’ll catch that what I rolled was not how many spaces my game piece moved. I haven’t come across one person who cares about earning new shields.

1,2023-10-15 12:46:45,I started playing about a month ago. The game either has a lot of “glitches” or they are ripping people off on purpose. It’s a waste of your time and money if you are spending any. There isn’t really a customer service. You can write to them and they just blow you off and hand you a few dice. They do not make up for your glitches. They do not make up for your loses or your time. The game is impossible to get anywhere. When you are set to finish an accomplishment of a lot of dice either the game will glitch or you can’t hit anything in the time span you are given. Same with building your buildings. That’s the algorithm in place. As far as the “ glitches”. I don’t know if it’s on purpose or they don’t have people that can produce a game properly. Anyway you look at it it’s not worth your time unless you want to spend loads of money and still loose your progress which you never are compensated. In my opinion you should never play this game….ever. Do not start playing. And if you do play make sure you take snap shots of your progress. Not that customer service does anything to make up for it because they don’t 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬.  Enter a nickname it’s says. So far do not play. Livid. Angry emojis are already taken. Speaks for itself,Monopoly go.   DO NOT PLAY
4,2023-09-19 13:17:52,"This game is very addictive. It’s all the competitiveness of the original game put on my phone and I enjoy it! You get to enjoy working with your friends and strangers to collect stickers to earn rewards, this makes it more enjoyable. Even though this game is fun some changes do need to be made.  1. The ratio of time it takes to reload dice to the amount of time it takes to play the reloaded dice are nonequivalent. Especially when you start to realize how many rolls it takes to complete parts of an adventure.  2. I understand the concept of not being about to trade gold card but in the original Monopoly offers/deals can be made why can this not be the case with the gold cards? We can offer multiple stickers, dice, or money for a gold card. That should be a future option.  3. When leveling up to a new board why are we only getting 50 dice no matter the level, that doesn’t seem to add up when it may have taken a 1,000 dice just to clear that board!  4. When getting the wheel deal what ever multiplier we have rolled on should apply to that spin.",Great Game but some changes are needed 😪
5,2023-07-06 17:08:04,"So this game has now become one of my new favorite games. It takes everything special and fun from the monopoly board game and makes it into a quick pace game that is perfect for all occasions. This game is so good i even got my whole family hooked on it and they all cant start playing. Now for the two issues. One, the time you have to wait for  dice is a little too much. A thirty minute wait or getting ten dice instead of five would both be beneficial to the game. Two, sometimes when i join the game it gives me an error message saying that the game must restart. Today when i joined the game i saw a pop up in game that said how the team was sorry for the bug that was occurring and that they would be trying to fix it with some free dice attached as a compensation for your issues. As soon as i had claimed the dice i had been kicked out of the game and when i logged back in my newly acquired dice were not there. I really love this game but this issue is persistently ruining it please fix soon.",Amazing game but two issues
4,2023-08-05 04:56:59,"My only problem with the game is the card distribution and there only being 121 boards. As I’m on board 95, I’m hoping more will be added soon. I have been stuck on the same cards for the last month or two. I don’t know if I will even get to finish all the sets before it ends because of it. Even tho I’ve been very faithful to the game playing everyday. I think I speak for everyone, everyone is needing the same cards and the game will not give them whatsoever, therefore, we can’t trade cards for cards that no one has. Also the in app purchases, I would purchase if the dice amount was worth purchasing. I can have 300 dice gone in five minutes so it’s not worth the $20 or however much it is. When you’re at a higher board, 300 dice doesn’t get you very far. So there’s no need to purchase anything that you have to offer. I would be interested in purchasing things if that were subject to change. I’d love to be able to purchase sticker packs by themselves. Would also love to see more collaborative events like the bakery event we had in the past.","Really fun, hoping for a few adjustments soon"
3,2023-06-25 11:55:00,"Ok, so I have my whole family playing this and it’s a lot of fun with the exception of how hoard the game and it’s algorithm makes it to get cards sets. We all play this game to accumulate dice rolls, without dice rolls you can’t play the game. See, what they do is help you get the sets to the first 9 card sets which hooks you in. Then from sets 10 through 21 it’s good luck these are your cards with 4 or 5 stars. Which aren’t found in the green or green and white card packs which they rip open, No the 1 through 3 star cards can be found there, Smh. Even the blue, purple and pink pack may not have 4 or 5 star cards in them at this point it just not fun anymore not to mention we’re unable to trade the GOLD cards which they give us multiple’s of……Why give them if I can’t trade them. Even though my family is holding strong the friends that were playing quit because it takes to long to get rolls or enough dice to make it fun again.  I wish I could give 5 stars, but I just can’t. I’m close to quitting too. Make Gold cards tradable, and make 4 and 5 star cards accessible through the entire game. Yes even in the little green or green and white card packs.","I Really Like This Game, But"
2,2023-11-05 15:22:54,"The game doesn’t make any sense and isn’t fair at all. You can reach such a high level and yet you’re limited to 80 dices? What in the world! Doesn’t matter if you’re level 4000 you still reach the max of 80 dices. That right there isn’t fair. It’s impossible to get new stickers. You will get the same stickers for weeks without ever getting a new sticker. Trading stickers is also another issues 90% of the time you will get scammed for a sticker. Which is crazy that people will take it that far. The partner invite is also another issue. If you decide to accept a random person request to build, they want you to do all the work while they get all the rewards. There should be a way for you to change your partner. I have tried so many times also on fb to trade to finally be able to finish my sets but no one ever wants to help anyone. This game is a cheat. Unless youre paying money to play its pointless. Yet they have people that have 20,000 dices with their hacked accounts and don’t say anything to them but the people that don’t spend any money for the game just to have a good time , give them a hard time to get anywhere in the game. Don’t waste your time playing",Doesn’t make sense
1,2023-10-14 16:21:12,"At first, I really enjoyed the game. However, the higher you get the more you realize the game is rigged and just a money grab. I keep getting the same boards to complete over and over again for higher prices which makes the game boring while I’ve seen other boards I’ve never had in y friends games when I visit their board. I’ve purchased and won many sticker sets and get the same duplicate stickers instead of the ones I need. This makes it impossible to complete albums. Teaching customers support is very difficult and when you do the issues aren’t resolved. When I win rewards that are supposed to give me new stickers they don’t show up in my album. Billions get stolen out of my bank when my friends only when millions which limits progress. The tournaments have bots playing against humans scoring thousands of points in minutes which makes them impossible to win. The partner tournaments give rewards to people that do nothing and you are forced to work with a partner to participate and win rewards. The dice cost too much to buy and take too long to replenish when you need so many to win tournaments and rewards. I’ve spent $100’s on this game to make progress and they keep taking money without getting what you paid for.",Not Fair
4,2023-07-24 04:27:20,"So first and foremost I never write reviews lol. But I love this game! If only this were real life and real money lol because I’m almost a billionaire on here but I digress. My only request would be to able to trade and interact with other players on the app (not FB) also I think we should be able to convert our money into rolls or stickers instead of paying for rolls or waiting an hour to get more rolls. If the developers can make that happen I’ll change my rating!  Lastly because I just thought of it. The developers should create additional games within the properties we’ve built. Instead of just building and moving to another board there should be some interaction with the properties themselves because essentially we’re just rolling dice, spending money, and building. I love the game but at some point it’s going to bore me because it will start to become redundant. So I hope you developers actually read your reviews. And like everyone else I agree waiting an hour for 7 rolls is asinine. You’ve created a dope game but hopefully it will continue to evolve and changes be made to keep the interest.",Love it but….
2,2023-11-10 13:59:56,"My review used to be on the spooky car fiasco that robbed me of finishing less than 5k points out on my last car. I was not adequately compensated for that at all.   Now I wanna change my review after reinstalling the game and promptly uninstalling it again. Once you get past level 127 it’s nearly impossible to make anymore progress, unless you spend $$ on the game I assume. So I cave and see how much rolls cost and was flabbergasted that they expect us to spend so much on a few seconds worth of rolls. ALSO, the properties cost so much to build in those higher levels that before you can acquire enough money, your board has been completely leveled, and your bank heisted back to nothing. Leaving the player desperately trying to use the minute amount of rolls we’re provided daily to make money BACK after being bankrupted to FIX properties instead of advancing in the game for new gameplay. I won’t be reinstalling this game until the events go back to 60k, rolls are easier to obtain, and boards are more reasonable to complete. When I’m on this game HOURS out of my day and have been on the same board for almost a WEEK, it’s no longer fun, only annoying.",You hit a certain point and it’s not worth playing.
1,2023-11-01 05:12:44,I don’t know what’s wrong with this but I have been playing everyday and I have opened plenty of sticker packs BUT have not received any new stickers. Some I have 29 of. I don’t need those. I never had huge quantities of other sets before. The trading page is a joke. Not real trades actually happening. The dice drop levels have dropped drastically. The higher the level you are doesn’t matter. Takes forever to complete when you don’t have enough dice. I’m about ready to delete the game if things don’t change. Sticker pack need to have a better variety and dice amounts should be more. I completed the last group and almost did a second time. This is very frustrating and I’m not going to spend my hard earned money on a game! You made the events harder by raising the amount you need to complete. But then the spins you do to complete are all low ones. So many times I have had the 2x multiplier on and it stops on the 2000 only to tick off to the next spot of 160. How is this always the case!! I am about to delete. This used to be fun Now it’s just scams and roll drops are crap. Start dropping some of the 3rd row sticker from the last 8 packs. Everyone I know needs the same ones. Stop with the duplicates!!!,Too many duplicates. Not much fun anymore
1,2023-09-12 17:21:45,"Honestly how perfect is it for the monopoly game to showcase greed where only those who spend $$ win and succeed. At first when you start playing you don’t notice all the fixed coding in the game that’s made to keep you losing, but the more you play the more obvious it gets. The game is designed the same way any carnival, slots, claw games are made, to make you feel like you have a chance. You get so close, lose, and then convince yourself that you still have a chance. The only ones who do well in this game are those who spend money or they cheat. I’m not asking for sunshine and rainbows, but it honestly feels like there is nothing in the game that isn’t rigged. The stickers have got to be the worst thing about the entire game. You can’t trade golds, but they give you over 10 gold duplicates before you even get a single gold you need. And especially after this new update where every single set has one gold, I have so many sets in the beginning that have one sticker left, but it’s gold and I’ve been given multiple duplicate golds in other packs. Anyways if you really want to get into this game, I don’t suggest it. Playing just for whatever is fine, but once you start actually trying to get into it..Good luck.",Why can’t games just not be rigged.
1,2023-09-12 17:31:44,This game was fun at first but it has become a game where the creators do all they can to take all your money. You can spend as much as you want and still won’t complete your sets nor will you complete challenges. They use BOTS on here to try to get you to spend money . They make it impossible to upgrade your landmarks by having it cost far to much. Only way you going to do it is by spending thousands and it can happen cause many ppl I know got so addicted they can’t pay their bills. While the owners are getting rich ppl playing are getting poor. It’s even worse that if you don’t get a gold sticker you won’t ever complete your sets and they keep feeding you duplicates to make that impossible too. You’ll have to spend over $100 just to TRY and get one card you need and mind you there are 189 of them . I do not recommend this app to anyone who doesn’t want to go broke . I promise you it’s addicting! Let’s make it where monopoly owners learn to stop being so greedy and everyone start deleting their app one by one . It’s so disturbing that they see ppl love to play and that’s when they decide to take more and more money from them after they get them hooked . Don’t download this game if you don’t want to worry about paying your rent..,Beware
3,2023-08-27 21:51:07,"The fun part is when you get a chance to increase your standing- money to build, dice, stickers, etc. The frustrating part is that it happens very rarely. I don't know how people get so much dice and move through the game so fast without spending money 'cause I'm always holding onto a thread with the bare minimum. When I finally save up enough dice to use higher rewards, it feels wasted on spaces that don't contribute to the game like free parking, utilities, and chance. As a single player you’re really just going round and round the board with minimal rewards. The stickers are also difficult to collect and complete boards instead relying on scammers to trade or getting doubles from the game to exchange. The game could massively improve by giving you incentive to compete with other players more than stealing money or knocking down buildings. There's very rarely any mini competitions that makes me feel motivated to keep building and get to a next space on the map. I like that this game doesn't necessarily need you to pay money to get a better standing, but the free option just keeps you pigeonholed in a lot of areas too.",Fun but frustrating
5,2023-11-03 00:05:32,"I absolutely love this game . In fact I’m quite addicted. Which brings me to my first wish . I would love to see more incentives for people who play every day since they started the game . Not just the 7 day because it resets as if you are starting over. Less dice money etc . For instance, some games have special awards for 30 day continuous playing and so on . Another idea is , I would love to see an in game chat and a way for players to see other players sticker books to make trading a lot easier and safer for your players .    The only downfall to the game is the stickers given in the packs . Within the last month of playing I only got two new stickers and a bunch of duplicates . It’s making it harder to be able to finish the books let alone the whole album. It’s very frustrating and sometimes makes me want to stop playing. I still still gave the game 5 stars because I do love it . I won’t give up just yet and I’ll keep hoping it gets better with the stickers .  Thank you !",Wishes  and stickers
3,2023-11-01 17:34:54,"My game just crashed 10 times in a row and I’m not sure why I even kept playing at that point. But every time the game restored I rolled the dice and I got to spin the wheel because I had a color match. Every single time the app restored and I spun the wheel before it would crash again I got THE EXACT SAME sticker set- all ten times. And of course it was the exact same three cards I already had. It really took quite a bit of the fun away to see the SAME PRIZE that many times down to the same exact cards. It all feels so predestined and pre programmed there is no chance or randomness not to even mention the crashing. Also I play this a lot but I refuse to spend a dollar on it. I get lucky here and there but it’s obvious I won’t win a big prize or probably even finish my sticker set if I don’t spend any money. Last thing- I understand there is going to be in-app purchases. But it’s excessive for me. It literally gets in the way of me playing the game, asking me to buy more dice rolls before I’m even done with the ones I have and it will do it SEVERAL TIMES.

1,2023-08-02 17:32:16,"I’ve never written an AppStore review before but I felt the need to bring this one up. The game is fun! It almost forces you to spend money for more dice rolls. The trading group is cool too and you interact more with Facebook friends you otherwise wouldn’t. I was obsessed for weeks!   But then I got tired of getting the same cards ALL the time. I even purchased certain packs to get guaranteed 4-5 star cards or additional Dice rolls to increase my chances of those cards and I STILL got duplicates. And I hate how long it takes for the dice to refresh. An entire hour for 5-10 rolls is so long when you have multipliers. I hated that. But anyway. I went to delete my entire account and that’s where this review comes from. The team forces you to put in your user name, number of dice you have left, email associated with the account and last purchase you’ve made. If you don’t know what it is they require you to screenshot specific items. After doing ALL those things they couldn’t verify my account and refused to delete it. That’s RIDICULOUS! I gave them everything and then some and still they wouldn’t. Don’t download it if you ever consider getting your whole account deleted.

5,2023-05-14 18:10:14,"I love this game, I’ve been playing for about 2 months now. Super fun gameplay although it’s not a classic monopoly game as I see reviews saying they’re disappointed it’s not. It’s kind of like if Monopoly was an idle game? The one thing I really get annoyed with is the pop ups. Not ads, well kinda but everytime you run out of rolls. 2 or 3 special offers will pop up, you have to close each one. Then it’ll ask you to connect to Facebook or something to get more rolls. Again upon opening the game, you’ll get more of these…. 2 special offer pop ups then a board report (that one’s fine I guess) then a invite friends thing. It’s just very annoying because you have to continually close them. At least make a setting to disable them. As someone who’s spent money on the game it just feels like I don’t need to be remind of the bazillion special offers you have going. Other than that it’s a fun game that is more or less free to play but I could see how it favors paying for rolls etc.","Great game, fix the pop ups."
4,2023-10-14 15:19:03,I love the game and being out and about in the public I see others enjoying the game as well. But with these stickers I feel as though we should be able to at least purchase stickers packs it doesn’t have to be all packs but at least a few. I say this because in the beginning new stickers would pop up quick but I feel as though as you get to the your basically forced to try your hardest to trade with anyone you can find seeing as how based on observation everyone does receive different cards based on the apps modifications.. If you do decide to allow the purchase of some sticker packs same as we upgrade landmarks MY ADVICE IS RANDOMLY ALLOW THE PURCHASE OF THE PACKS WITH A LIMIT OF 2 to 3 being able to be purchased when that the time frame appears for that gift giving moment … that way your at least giving all players a Real Chance to obtain the grand prize because let’s be honest it’s not like you can message your friends on the app to inquire if they have what your looking for.

2,2023-09-03 18:09:32,So I really love the game. It’s fun and a bit challenging with trying to get the cards and the rewards are awesome….5 stars….HOWEVER…now the reason I’m only giving it two stars is its pretty much set up where you have to spend money just to win the events because once you get I to the higher stickers albums those gold stickers are extremely hard to get and they are also the only ones you can sent to friends……the new sticker event just started and they made it even harder by putting gold cards in every album now AND they cut all the rewards in half. The rewards in the first sticker event was the reason why it was so awesome to complete the albums and help you grow your level not to mention the crazy reward of you completed all of them. They cut that reward in half also. It’s so hard to grow now because the rewards are so much less so it pretty much getting to the point where you have to pay to play to stand a chance and win the events so you can get the stupid gold cards to even complete the little albums. That’s the only reason I’ve giving 2 stars. I don’t want to spend money on a game so at some point I will have to just stop playing. 💁🏻‍♀️,Turning into PTP game.
1,2023-09-08 09:52:25,"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY I have been playing this game for 5 months.   It’s addictive similar to a slot machine.  The payout instead of cash…are dice and stickers.l(you complete sticker sets to get more dice).   There is absolutely positively no way to achieve anything in this game without spending a sizable amount of money on a weekly basis.  They continue to make the dice payouts for events smaller.  They continue to make the dice payouts for completing individual sticker sets smaller.  Along with reducing dice payouts, they extend the time/tasks it takes to complete events.  I understand.  Apps are created and designed to make money, but when Scopely the app creator is constantly in real time “rigging the game” to prevent one from proceeding in any meaningful way without dropping cash is Yugely misleading.  I am convinced developers are intentionally misleading and making it harder to progress. This game is worthy of reporting to the Consumer Affairs division of your state Attorney General.  It should be removed from Apple and Google App Store.  It should be removed from Facebook.  This app serves zero purpose but to extract money while subvertly changing outcomes of play.  Investing time and money in this game will leave you feeling angry and empty. You have been warned.",A Dice Slot Machine Without Cash Payout
3,2023-08-28 11:23:02,"All of my friends and coworkers play so I decided to give it a go. I am still new so idk the max increase of rolls you can have but I do know 60 rolls is not enough to do anything (where I’m at now). It’s a wait to play game if you don’t spend money. I wish there were more options to get dice. I’m not as mad about the cards as others but there is no way to get the purple packs as a new player when you don’t have rolls. My biggest issue is targeted attacks. We should be able to block people in the same or at least limit the amount of attacks one person can do in 24 hours. I had one person attack me 10 times in less than an hour and I can’t counter attack because they haven’t built up anything on their board (so what are they saving for?!?!). I rarely land on bank heist so I can’t rob them. I needed $5 million to level to the next board but can’t bc this person keeps attacking when I get enough money. People shouldn’t be able to attack back to back. Once they attack you, it should be an waiting period until the next attack. I’m close to quitting the game bc there is no limit on it",Basic game but frustrating
3,2023-08-22 14:07:33,"I started playing this game because my daughter wanted someone to play with so I thought what the heck. Well I got addicted. At first I would hop on a few times a day but as I became more familiar with the game I started playing more and more to the point that I’m barely sleeping. When I found out that you collected stickers I thought that was a fun idea and my daughter wanted to swap with me for the ones each other needed. After 2 weeks of playing I was getting all duplicates, no new stickers at all. I turned to the trade group and found that both the trade and donation group chats on monopoly go were a joke. People hoard the cards and will trade for more 5 star cards only to turn around and sell them for $20 a piece! Seriously. You need to find a way that the cards can be limited maybe 2 of the higher stickers at most that their album will accept this way they still have an extra to trade with.  Another thing you need to change is as you increase in levels the dice you receive should increase. That 50 is a joke.  There are so many other things that need to be addressed but I would be here all day",Fun in the beginning
5,2023-07-24 03:20:40,"This game is sooo Fuuunnn! Very competitive if you are playing with friends & family. I gave the game 5 ⭐️’s & it’s well deserved. My only complaint is there are some glitches & for whatever reason I never get any new stickers like ever! It’s been almost 4 weeks since I got 1 only 1 new sticker. You get so many packs to open but nope my board just keeps disappointing me. Don’t let that discourage you because trust me it’s so fun! Plus There is a sticker group on FB but if you don’t have 5 ⭐️ Stickers then you can forget it, you will get a nice person every once in a while but it can be hard to ask when you aren’t getting anything bigger than a 1 or 2 ⭐️ Stickers over and over. It doesn’t matter how far in play you are either  I’m on Map 81 & most of my family is on Maps 10-40 and they have so many more than me. That part does get me down especially when you spend money and the stickers you paid for are the same 1 or 2 ⭐️’s you’ve been getting in game play.  Happy Playing 🎲🎲",Game play
5,2023-04-27 09:45:08,"I don’t usually leave reviews on apps but I had to for this one. I LOVE playing the original Monopoly board game, so when I saw there was an app, I jumped on it.   What I love about this game compared to other games is that, yes, there is an option to make purchases BUT the purchases are not the only option to “make money” or gain points or anything like that. While most games seem to just let you get comfortable enough that you feel like you had to purchase something to further enjoy the game, this one lets you enjoy it regardless of if you make a purchase or not. It’s FAIR. It’s not one of those games that makes you think “well, if I hadve spent x-amount of dollars, the game would give me more points or I would earn more in the game.” Nope! Gaining points, rolls, earning money, etc is so easy and fair which is why I love this game.   Do I understand all of it? Nope. Ain’t got s clue what the stickers are for, but that’s ok. I still love playing the game and can’t wait for more!",If only making millions in real life was this easy
3,2023-05-20 21:59:24,"So I like the game but I’m disappointed in some of the features. I don’t like having to wait 55 minutes just for 5 rolls. I also don’t like that when you run out of rolls you get like 3 or 4 pop ups about different packages available which is extremely annoying. The most disappointing thing about this game is that the point of it is to win. In the original game of monopoly when the other player is bankrupt that means that lose. In this game the system will notify you that the other player is bankrupt but nothing actually happens to the other players account, they don’t lose any money they don’t lose any property. I’ve tried it out with 3 of my friends and we’ve all bankrupted each other and the money doesn’t go down, there’s no notice that we’ve been bankrupted or lost in any way we don’t lose any rolls or anything so the big bankrupt banner that pops up means absolutely nothing for the other player. What’s the point of playing the game if there’s never a winner. I’ll still play the game here and there but I’m not spending any more money in it if there’s no real way to win.",It’s fun but disappointing
1,2023-09-01 17:17:45,"context: gold cards are NON-TRADEABLE and the game even goes as far as to give you duplicates of these cards that you simply can do nothing with :)  so the last sticker album had good rewards for each set and no gold cards until the sets near the end. now this new album has a required gold card for EACH set, as well as rewards that are way less than the previous album.  they’ve also increased the amount of stars needed for the large, possibly only valuable vault (how you trade in extra stickers for a chance at new ones even though it usually still just gives you duplicates). it was previously 1500 for the largest one, and it is now 2500. that is 1000 extra duplicate cards you will need for even a slim chance at getting that new card you need.  this screams “greed” from the developers because in making the rewards lower and harder to even get, they know it will force players to spend real money in order to get the things they need for the game. very disappointed and probably going to stop playing soon.  but hey, if you’ve got a whole lot of extra money to give to the greedy developers, this is the perfect game for you!",game is becoming harder to play without spending money. greed from developers

2,2023-11-05 15:45:17,"Love the game but the facebook group attached to this game is full of thieves and admin does nothing about it! It should be for sticker trading only and they allow selling to happen, then people get taken for actual money which is sad (I don't fall for the fake stuff)! The extra post for the dice and stickers overshadow all the post for people actually looking for stickers to trade so it is pointless to even try. The game itself is good except you can never get the stickers you want. It has been 33 days now since I received my last NEW sticker and it was only one.  Gold stickers can only be traded when they allow it and it is whichever ones they decide to allow to be traded, which is dumb. ALLOW GOLD STICKER TRADING, even if it is just for one day a week, allow all gold stickers to be traded without restriction. People stop playing because of the repetition of stickers, it gets boring and annoying. AND the pop ups every time you open the fame or run out of dice is so annoying!

My ideas about what you should add!! 1.You guys should add how we can trade golden cards to each other 2.We should be able to trade dices to each other like if we run out of dice people could trade us some 3.You guys should have a shop that we could but stuff with our money like dice,cards!

1,2023-09-27 02:23:18,"I’ve been playing this game for a few months now and I do enjoy it sometimes but most of the time I stay very frustrated with it. I’ve spent a LOT of money buying dice and I never get anywhere. I’ve also been overcharged several times and my child spent money without my permission and I have not been refunded anything. I continue to play the game but I will not spend any more money. I am very disappointed that I have not been refunded and it is not okay for my accounts to be overcharged for any reason. I’ve also had to shut down my bank account because a random company was  withdrawing money from my account, not sure if it is related to monopoly go, but it is worth mentioning because I rarely use my card for anything online. This game is very addicting if you have a competitive spirit. But the game is definitely rigged and you will not earn what you deserve without paying for dice or not playing for several days and letting your dice build up, but then you will miss out on the tournaments & daily treats. I wish more than anything, that I would not of ever downloaded this game. I hope that someone in charge of improving this game, will see this and make some changes to make the game more rewarding & enjoyable. Thanks",BEWARE
1,2023-09-05 19:43:22,First of all 8 rolls an hour is dumb when my dice fill number is 80. I believe we should at get our dice filled every hour. The game is rigged because it’s like impossible to fill the stickers without paying money for dice or sticker packages but even then the system keeps giving you the same stickers over and over. You can’t trade the gold stickers so what is the point of them. I have been playing this game for months now and haven’t gotten new stickers in several weeks. This is ridiculous. I’m almost on level 300 so I know I should have gotten the stickers by now. I know people that have completed 2 or more albums on the level I am. I have spent a lot of money trying to get packages to get the highest stickers packages only to get the same stickers over and over again. There should be a way to trade extra gold stickers for the missing ones we don’t have since we can’t trade them with our peers. The trading on Facebook is beyond crazy because it’s easy to get scammed. I HATE THIS GAME BECAUSE IT’S SO FRUSTRATING AND CHEATING!! Y’all just want to Monopolize on our real money but IM DONE. You won’t get another penny from me. Now the new album gives less set rewards WTH 🤦🏽‍♀️ IM OVER IT! DELETING NOW. THIS IS NO FUN ANYMORE,I’m deleting this game
1,2023-09-06 00:03:31,"Spent a ton of money on this app and I mean a ton. Especially to complete virtual sticker packs that lead to a big prize 🥲 How silly to be swept into that. I played with multipliers for weeks but the $$ never matched the multiplier unless it was on heists. The amount of rolls you get without paying big money are ridiculous and how long you have to wait to get them. The amount of times you land on certain space’s definitely goes along with what event is going on. I stopped leaving buildings up overnight to avoid getting pummeled while sleeping and then magically random players started winning multibillion dollar heists over night draining my whole account. I’ve never gotten anything over $1.5 billion heists even on multiplier. And when I first started playing along side with my bf, we never had the full amount the other person won actually taken from our bank. But with random player there are billions being taken from the bank leaving it empty by sunrise. This game is a total scam from how the sticker situation works, down to the algorithm of the rolls. I am done with this game. I urge you not to waste your time or money. Fix all the bugs and issues with your game and try not to be so greedy.",Rigged and Made to pay to play
5,2023-06-01 04:30:54,Monopoly go…one may hear such words and think to themselves that it’s just a stupid mobile game but I think not… monopoly go makes my heart stop. Every time someone mentions this absolute beauty of a game my blood pressure rises through the roof. Though the highs and lows monopoly go has helped me though it all… I’m a huge coward so when I don’t know what to do or what to say in pubic this is the game I play. A lot of people think I’m ugly and that’s why I relate to the monopoly guy. When I see him I see a direct reflection of me. Many people may say he’s annoying to me tho? He’s perfect in every way. Sorry I got a little side tracked there but I find this game very funny and fun to play. Now over this past month I have spend $52 dollars on this game. My friends think I have an gambling addiction. Pretty much what I’m trying to get at is that when I’m drowning in my own sorrow this game gets me out of the dumps and allows me to spread my wings and swim away from all the hardships in life and focus on my rolls…,Monopoly go changed my life…
2,2023-11-10 16:49:02,Monopoly GO is a really fun and addictive game but unfortunately to get the most out of this game you are almost required to spend money. I’ve seen many posts saying that the reload time for free dice is to slow and I’d agree with a cap of 80 dice you’re lucky to get a few minutes of play time. Yes you can play with the one time multiplier to get more time in game but good luck progressive in any of the tournaments or challenges with that. This game is built around spending money in hopes of bigger rewards it’s a glorified slot machine but in this case you can only lose money. It would be nice that in some of the challenges that the free dice rewards weren’t so seemingly impossible to get. The fact that in order to get a 100 free dice you need to get 500 points in the tournament challenge but the reward before that you only needed 10 to get some stupid repeat cards you already have. Monopoly GO is a waste of money and the company knows exactly what they are doing. I write this review as a word of caution to new and existing players because I sure as heck know that no changes will be made when it comes down to how much is made for developers on this game.,Pay to play
3,2023-10-05 22:36:08,"First, let’s start off by saying I Absolutely Love this game and it can be very addictive. However, I am not pleased with the limited dice we are given. Those like myself that have put money into the game feel we should definitely be compensated fairly. The duration to receive dice are out of this world. We should be able to gift each other dice or change the currency into dice. I understand you have to make money off the game, however as many people play, I’m sure you have yet to miss one red cent. All the technicalities that I’ve personally encountered was not compensated fairly for . There have been glitch after glitch, with no return of Gold Stickers or Tournament pieces. My mom finished our Toy for the tournament we are in now and when I got ready to open ours the game was making me roll more of my puzzle pieces to complete something that had already been finished. I never received compensation, nor any prizes. I feel wholeheartedly that with time and complaints Mr. Monopoly will make things right. I’m definitely rooting from the sidelines because it’s truly a fun game to play with peers !!!",Dear Mr. Monopoly
2,2023-10-17 00:33:37,"I okay it, but have been getting increasingly disappointed. Game is buggy, tournaments are always pay to play if you want to actually win them for the most part. The dice refresh is ridiculous, 8 dice an hour when you get into the higher boards is literally useless. Thankful for people being able to find dice links on other websites. Without them the game would be boarderline unplayable. The fact that the weekly challenge gold packs, wheel spin sticker packs, and tournament packs  dont adjust based on your game progress is annoying. I don’t need a ton of one star cards,  The safes don’t have great rewards and you usually would be trading in you’re duplicates for more duplicates. Not worth it.  Was super excited about golden blitz, just to be disappointed that would couldn’t pick which gold stickers you could trade. It assigned me stickers I already had one of, so I got nothing out of it and it was useless. Just make gold stickers available for trades.  I’ve played the game for some weeks now, but honestly I’m getting over it and will probably delete soon. It seems like developers got greedy and don’t really care about user feedback.",Meh.

I find that this game can boost interest in the Monopoly board games. I’m always looking for ways to earn more rolls. I try to save mine before bed and when I wake up I have at least ten more rolls. I always do my daily logins and invite at least one person from my contacts each day. I love this game so much I made another account on my Tablet to play more!

I put $2 in and got about five mins extra play, oh boy. After playing a bit I noticed how rigged it seems. A day or two waiting for dice to slowly build up and then enough to quickly get through a level or two and then back to wait. It’s not fun to play for five mins and a bit more here and there. I need something I can do all the time and not the same expected round n round over and over. I just woke and got about 80 dice with my free morning gift and I landed on free parking, just visiting,income tax and jail with no doubles over and over. With one dot on my last building to go to level up. Rigged?.. I think so. Think I’ve had enough. Not sure why people complain about the pop ups so much when the game stinks anyway and no one said you have to sit and close them when you get down to the last dice,just close the app. If you want to do something fun and challenging.. get the Temu app for games, put USJ4647 on the homepage search bar and win win win.

3,2023-09-11 02:44:50,I have this a 3 start because of the cons of the game. This game is very fun and gets you interacting with many on it whether that be friends or family. The only thing that makes this a 3 star is due to how long it takes to get dice and or getting stickers. Being able to only trade 5 stickers is insane! Like make the trade limit at least 10! And not only that but not being able to trade gold cards is stupid. Why are we able to get extra gold cards if we can’t trade them?! I mean at least put a limit of how many gold cards can be traded in a day for example 1 or 2. Also for events put more crap on the board! Only having 6 cookies on the board from the bakery even was crazy…you only get so many chances to lans on them and not only that you don’t get enough to do even 1 roll cause your limit is 80 dice and doing a multiplier will kill your dice then your waiting 6hr to get back to full when you take like 30sec to get rid of them. Hopefully monopoly can do something about these issues just to make the game more fun and not being a game we all delete soon.,3 Stars…?
4,2023-08-16 01:48:37,"I’m giving this a 4 because I’m going to give you a LEGIT honest review. It’s really fun but SOOOOOOO ******* annoying. They almost never give you any opportunity to earn more dices except for the merely 5 dices an hour (you get 8 after you’re a certain level) otherwise they want you to spend money paying for their offers but their offers are worse than scammers on facebook because FOR 24 DOLLARS YOU’RE ONLY GIVING ME 500 DICES? AT MY LEVEL THATS NOTHING I CANT EVEN FINISH A BOARD WITH THAT. Even after level 4000 I still only get 50 dives after completing a board. WHY????? HOW MUST I continue the game if I have NO DICE?

How annoying come on Mr.M do better how can we complete packs when we can’t trade gold cards, can’t roll because we have no dice so therefore we can’t complete albums to get more dice.  Team challenges are fun but impossible if ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE NO DICE. 5 days to complete the challenges at 240k. If it’s going to cost that much make the team challenges more than 5 days so people actually have a chance to complete..  THE BOTS.

4,2023-08-24 01:25:20,"I started playing this game because my son and his gf needed rolls. I’ve been playing ever since. Over all the game is fun but I do have a couple of irritants. 1) I don’t understand how when you move up in levels EVERYTHING goes up EXCEPT rolls. Clearing boards you money goes us but rolls stay at 50. Even the get out of jail payment goes up, taxes go up, but rolls become scarce unless you pay. That is my biggest complaint. 2) Even if you pay to play there are no guarantees that you’re going to get anything you need. Some of the rewards are pretty “cheap” compared to what you have to roll just to get them. 3) what the heck is the purpose of giving 1500+ duplicate cards? I promise I believe that y’all have an algorithm that is so high strung that y’all make sure we use all our rolls just to be able to get 100 more rolls so we can get more duplicate cards. This game is a love/hate relationship.  Yes I’ll keep playing but hoping you’ll start making the rolls go up at each level just like everything else. That’s only right.",Addictive game
2,2023-08-14 17:58:45,"The roll regeneration is way too low. The max you can regenerate dice is 8 per hour and the max you can regenerate is 80. 10 hours to refill your dice if you have depleted them. In order to win anything at a rate high enough to advance you have to use multipliers which depletes the dice quickly, again leaving you waiting. Very hard to win any of the challenges this way. Stickers are very hard to win as well. You end up with tons of duplicates and waiting and waiting for the stickers you actually need. There’s no I’m game messaging or sticker trading function. You are left to use social media to try and trade which is extremely difficult and has become increasingly unfruitful as people don’t trade in good faith and have even begun selling stickers instead of actually trading. The wheel rewards for completing a color set are also very low. They don’t increase with your level so even though you’re on level 100+ and it costs multi millions to upgrade your landmarks, you only get 1 or 2 million from the wheel or a few low star stickers.

The requirement to collect numerous golden stickers has made the game more challenging and, in my opinion, greedier. Additionally, the wheel of stickers rarely grants the blue sticker pack anymore, and the album has become more complex in terms of sticker collection, resulting in fewer dice rewards. I understand the need for profit, but this approach is not the most effective. Out of the 20 friends who used to play, only 2 remain active. I sincerely hope that you address these issues and revert to the previous format or, at the very least, make the game more player-friendly. Increasing dice rewards, improving the chances of obtaining the blue sticker pack, and eliminating the requirement for a golden sticker in each set would greatly improve the overall gaming experience. The current state of the game has discouraged even regular players from actively participating. Please rectify these concerns as the previous updates/album offered a more enjoyable and worthwhile experience.","""USED TO BE"" A GREAT GAME"
3,2023-10-19 13:39:41,"I have enjoyed this game for the few weeks that I have had it. It is getting old. The reason for that is EVERYTHING IS PAY TO WIN. All the tournament things have to be won by extreme luck and or using your money. Most of the rewards later on in the game reinforce the idea that this game is just pulling an EA. I’ll be at a stage where one upgrade of about 25 upgrades I need will cost 6-8 million for a lower level and I get only about 1.5 million from a daily thing that happens if I get lucky. Since that’s not enough m, it sits there, just for me to be out of rolls (the way you play the game) to lose it to 5 other people by the next morning when I can actually play again since your rolls stay around 40-70 and only regenerate 7 per hour which is also a money grab. This game is really good, and is fun when your not only spending 2-5 minutes on it a day unless you spend your money. This is just like Apex Legends cosmetics and it’s annoying. I hope this company will actually learn from the hate that EA gets for doing this and change what they do.","Ok, so it’s a pretty good game"
1,2023-10-22 15:25:13,"There genuinely is not enough time to break down all the frustrations this game has but the one that is just absolutely ridiculous is the fact that people who aren’t even on your friends list are capable of heists…. There is constant pushback of this app and it quite literally advertises every third second to link social media accounts, contacts, and follow links on MOGO app for ‘free dice’ …it’s a complete scam.  Even for someone that’s only playing for fun and not competition, this app is NOT for you. It will constantly miscount dice, and miscount squares, it glitches when you’re close to a big milestone and increases the amount of people that can attack you or rob your bank. Why have such a complicated setup for users to link accounts so complete strangers can sabotage your progress…. What’s the point in having friends when people you don’t even know can rob you? I totally understand the shutdowns and allowing strangers to crossover HOWEVER, I just feel like only people that you’ve brainwashed into friendships on MOGO should be able to do bank heists but I’m just some dumb user in a sea of other users that are loosing interest in this game and it’s algorithm. *super sad face*",Compromising Algorithm
2,2023-09-14 03:43:26,"I understand this is a game and you gotta make money off of a game I just feel like it’s super hard to get dice when you don’t pay to win. I can see how things get set up and how the algorithm works.   I really really love the game but there could be big improvements to make this game not so frustrating. I have a team of friends who all help each other out and are on various levels and we all have the same complaints. It’s just hard to trade things between friends, the cap on dice every hour and with every board doesn’t correlate with how much it costs to upgrade buildings once you get in the 100s. The game knows when you’re screwed and it drives you further into the hole until you’re desperate enough to pay for dice/cards/money. Again, I know it’s a game & they gotta make their money but I feel like there could be a better set up. I used to play board kings which is very similar to this game and I wasn’t a fraction as frustrated as I am with this gameplay.

5,2023-11-02 21:17:59,"I Love This Game! I enjoy it during work, relax time, or stuck in traffic. I even got my family to play with me. I love all the creative ideas that it brings. My favorite part to this is the partner events these are the best as it keeps you in your toes! What I dislike is the fact that whether you play all day or less you still get the same crappy cards. There’s no new cards given out which makes it harder to complete the books. I do Like the new feature of being able to share gold cards the only difference is everyone is trying to get the same card so it’s pointless to ask anyone if they have it. What I think will make it better and keep ppl playing is more Partner events, an upgrade on the dice give away its been 25 for the longest, and allowing everyone to have RANDOMS gold cards to share that way we can actually help each other! The goal is to keep ppl playing and not causing them to delete the app.",Win Lose
5,2023-10-29 11:28:02,"I will start by saying I love this game!  I play daily with my family and friends, but somehow we always need the SAME stickers.  It is like you choose one or two stickers that no one gets (unless you are buying them I guess).  I still need the gold sticker on set 7, however I have the gold sticker for set 21.  I have everyone of the stickers in 7 but the gold one, however I only have 2 stickers and the gold one in 21.  It’s crazy.  I have 5 Trister stickers and 4 Norse.  You chose Trister to be able to send, but whole family had that one.  I live paycheck to paycheck so I can’t afford to spend money on this game.  It seems to win a contest you have to buy dice.  Give us a chance to win, give us more than 8 dice an HOUR!  I get to play maybe one hour a day.  My dice be at 80 when I get off work in the afternoon and I spend them in a few minutes.  I try to trade to get stickers, but my friends need the same stickers I do.  I guess I’m going to have to uninstall the game, because I can’t advance like I once did in the game, the properties cost to much and I can’t earn enough money to advance because of the few dice.  I like the car partner game, but if you roll a low number (800 or less, the graph barely moves). I have Not completed all four cars yet before the event ends.  Please allow us to get more dice everyday without having to purchase them.  Some of us just CANT afford to buy dice.",Sticker and dice
2,2023-09-28 18:31:50,"This game is fun but there’s so much wrong with it. The biggest problem I have with the game is the sticker situation ... it’s impossible and frustrating. You get the same stickers over and over again and never get the gold stickers….if you do it’s a repeat gold sticker that you already have. You can’t trade gold stickers but can get repeat gold stickers??? It doesn’t make sense. Giving your stars away for sticker packs only for them to be even more stickers you already have is even more frustrating. Only 8 dice an hour is NOT enough at all. It should be a lot easier to get larger amounts of dice. The higher your level, the more dice you should be able to get. The game should be reasonably playable. People have been complaining about this for months but there has been no change made and no communication that concerns have at least been heard. MOST IMPORTANTLY , I can’t even get into the game anymore. It glitches out when I try to play. A lot of other people are complaining of this too. Might as well just delete at this point. This game needs fixed!",The game is glitching so bad you can’t even get on to play
1,2023-08-31 22:26:29,"Games are supposed to be fun right? I understand about having things in the game that we have to buy.  However, if you trading cards and the Gold stars cant be traded then your soley depending in the game to give it to you. Which is crazy when so many people are complaining about the same things, getting duplicates of Good cards but not the ones they need. What do they do go an offer a sticker pack for $20 up to $99 with 1 sticker guaranteed that came with dice.  Money grab! People play games to relax in the economy we are in who has money to just be wasting on a game. Not to mention the endless glitches.  The new stickers started today and now each album needs a gold. Which means again you are hoping the game gives it to you.  When it started it gave us cards then glitched. Then they took those cards away!!! And lessened the cards we should of started with.  Now ive bought dice to try and finish certain stuff but it was small amounts. Why are we still waiting depending on your level for up to 8 dice every hour!  I really feel like this game is more so about money now and not even fun!  I actually wish i could give it 0 stars. Do better monopoly!!",Money Grabber Game
3,2023-07-17 19:00:45,"I do love this game however, getting the stickers that you need is impossible. Each time you complete a stage, challenge, or receive a reward for stickers you continuously get duplicate stickers. The same thing goes for the friends you trade stickers with. So, it leads to everyone needing the same stickers. I’ve been waiting on ONE sticker for the past 4 or 5 days and instead of getting awarded new stickers I just keep getting duplicates. This is my only complaint. As far as being the victim of a bank heist… I just make sure that I spend the majority of my money building up properties before I log out. This way there’s not much money for other gamers to heist away from you. I learned this lesson after waking up and finding out that someone stole $100 million from me in a bank heist. The purpose of the game is to proceed to the next level, and you have to build property in order to do so. So, you’re always going to have to spend the money in your bank, you’ll be upset if you concentrate on building the money instead of building the property.",I do love this game however…
1,2023-06-06 10:19:16,"The actual game is great but i just quit playing after not receiving my rewards for inviting, there’s a bar that you fill up inviting others and you get a larger prize when it’s full as well as prizes with every friend who signs up, I’ve had multiple friends sign up usung my link right next to me and I receive nothing and no credit, out of like 10 people who have signed up using my links I’ve gotten credit for 2 and I’m literally just over it, as much as I like the game it’s designed to try to get you to spend actual money, with the free prizes and prizes for inviting others it makes it pretty easy to play without paying, but with the bugs and not getting your rewards it makes it like any other pay to win,in my opinion The game absolutely cheats when your low on dice it takes you to the cleaners and holds you back in order to try to force you to buy dice and it has a way of getting you to sign other people up without giving you the credit, because why would you pay actual money if your getting enough dice off of free prizes rewards and invite rewards.

2,2023-11-01 17:16:07,"So what’s up with the game error every time i hit a milestone or something? First i landed on a color set and before i was able to spin an error message pops up and makes the game restart, i lose all progress i just gained and start back from where i was when i opened the app. i roll again, land on a different color set and actually get to spin this time. i spin and complete my first set of stickers AND THE ERROR MESSAGE COMES SO GUESS WHAT? i lost all of that. i land on the color set again and get the cards but this time i did not complete the sticker set and it doesn’t give me an error. so when i get huge rewards the game basically says no try again and takes it away from me, this has happen during heist, shutdowns, me updating my buildings, opening cards, getting wheels to update my car, opening daily prizes, literally anytime i get a huge rewards it restarts and i lose all progress. its happened before but usually only once every time i play, today it has happens OVER 10 TIMES!?!? and i have lost so much. mind u i am still being bank heisted and shut down while all my rewards are being taken away.",Rigged
1,2023-10-12 23:51:05,"The game was fun at first until the makers and owners of the game got greedy. Getting dice and leveling up the boards were already hard and expensive at first but they actually had to make it even more difficult to do all that. Why are we still getting only 50 dice for completing a board? Why are we getting only 25 dice daily IF that link gets sent out. There are so many problems with the game but they're solely focusing on the “glitches” of airplane mode or adding friends to get more dice. How about fixing the amount of bots that are in the game or figuring out how some people are on someone’s friend list but the other person doesn’t have them as a friend? With a company like this I actually don’t feel bad that people were cheating, they deserve to lose every penny that they scammed out of everyone. What is 8 dice an hour going to do? BFFR Scopely. A discussion section was created in discord by people that run the game but do they even read the complaints or suggestions?

1,2023-09-18 17:55:43,"When I first started playing this game, it was fun & competitive. It’s only been a few months & it’s no longer that way. There are so many bots, it’s almost impossible to win any tournament. The events require so many special tokens, it’s nearly impossible too. Also, the event wining requirements aren’t the same for everyone…in the last one, many people needed 2500 collars for a new token, while many others only needed 1600…not fair. I’ve spent actual money on this game, you’d think those people would get something in return, but no, just continual duplicate cards with no way to complete sticker sets/albums. Other ways to get gold cards are also nearly impossible, from the wheel spin that never lands on the gold or 4* packs to the weekly wins that have now been taken away. From the time you complete board 1 until infinity, you only get 50 dice…50 dice is nothing compared to what you’re wanting people to do. Free dice is capped at 80 a day, with 8 an hour…shouldn’t be a cap and should be higher than 8 an hr. I’ve never spent money on a game until now, and I’m regretful I did.

1,2023-09-08 22:28:03,"This game was fun however there seems to be a glitch where random people (or bots) who you are not friends with on FB or the game can constantly attack you and rob your bank. I’ve been getting attacked by what I believe to be a bot for weeks now. I am not friends with that account however they are able to repeatedly attack me and I am only able to revenge them once until it attacks me again. Same with the bank robbery, this account has been stealing money via bank robberies for weeks now and it’s never once shown up on my end for a bank robbery. There is no way to remove this account as I am not friends with it. There’s also an account who I am friends with on FB but not monopoly go who is constantly attacking my properties everyday and I don’t have the option to attack them back more than once. I cannot remove this person because we are not friends on monopoly go. This game game needs to include a block button for situations like this. It almost feels like harassment. Due to this I’ve requested my account be deleted but have had little no help with customer service. They make you go through a lot to delete your account.",Too many glitches!
4,2023-09-06 19:21:16,The game itself is really fun and addicting and you can play with friends and trade cards it even has its own Facebook trading group. The only thing I wish was diffrent is when you move up on boards it should be more than 50 rolls the higher level you are im on board 150 and it should be higher then 50 rolls since price gets higher. Another thing to add is what’s the point of having gold cards when you can’t trade them I get all these duplicates and you can’t do nothing with them. Another thing to add is it gets annoying when you run out of rolls and a billion adds pop up I get doing it the first time but when you use the rolls multiplier multiple times untill you run out of rolls and it keeps popping up 3-4 adds it gets old real fast. I also feel like for level 150 rolls should be higher then 80/80 maybe I’m used to another game called board kings which is just like this game but cheaper and easier but other then that it’s a great game just needs some tweaks,Fun but needs work
5,2023-08-09 00:54:32,This game is super fun and addictive but they make it impossible to get the gold stickers. I am in the facebook group and everyone is missing the same cards. I feel as though you’ll never get the chance to complete the album without spending actual money in game. There aren’t a lot of options or opportunities to get higher star cards. Also there are a lot of glitches. Such as when the mega heist buffer is on i will have times where i don’t get a single mega heist and it will show normal heist. I also will get crashes randomly where it will shut me out the game. And the amount of time it takes to refill rolls is a little ridiculous but you’re able to gain them in many ways when there are events hosted in game so i can’t complain too much about the dice. I do love how you are able to interact with other players landmarks and how easy it is to stack up money when you do have the dice.,Great game with some frustrating issues.
2,2023-08-18 13:49:31,"Once you get a bit further in game seems beyond rigged. If you start paying seems to only get worse. Never really get ahead bc the costs keep increasing at each level. And then they encourage trading in facebook group but have far too many scammers who offer trades but dont trade back. I just lost a precious 5 star card by someone not following through. There has to be some way the developers can make it so trades can only get unlocked if both parties submit to them? I dunno, but there are too many of us in the facebook ready to quit based on poor trade management on the facebook page, but you cant seem to complete all decks without trading. After this current card deck competition is done I’m done with the game. No longer as fun, seems to rigged, and too many gold cards that cant be traded.

4,2023-08-15 16:20:25,More dice needs to be given if I don’t get to have more for an hour. Dice needs to be given sooner than an hour especially if I am only getting 6 dice. That means that if I don’t win any dice during my play I can pretty much only play once a day. I do not like periodically checking just to see I have 6 dice and can only roll twice and I may not even be able to get more shields in those two rolls. Not to mention when I do 10 or 20 max and land on jail I never get doubles and am always paying. I don’t want to spend real money on dice and shouldn’t have to. When I get more dice I stay on the game longer. This waiting a full day for my dice to replenish so I can play for more than 5 minutes really makes me want to delete the game. And the free parking can last 15 minutes or an hour. How can someone enjoy the free parking extra when we have no dice in that time frame. Do better and shorten the time for dice replenishment or give way more dice than only 6 in a single hour 😡,Would be fun if I had more dice

They don’t just hit you for a little bit of money either they take 10+ million. Now I wouldn’t have a problem with this if we can rob them back or sabotage their boards but they only let you do bank heist on your friends. I’ve talked to several other players to see if I was the only one and every player with large sums of money all had this problem and they all said it was a stranger (aka a bot the game uses to make us buy something) and that they too can only do bank heist on their friends. So how is it that strangers can do bank heist on us? The other issue is the stickers.

The video clips I saw made it seem like I would be playing the classic monopoly but with animations for certain activities. However, this game takes away the feel of actually playing a board game or let alone being actively involved. This game is an Idle Monopoly where you don’t feel like your choices matter much. You just go in circles automatically accruing money, waiting until you have cash to put down for properties. You don’t even buy the board pieces.  Not to mention playing with others is just stopping on a Railroad and taking money from other people’s board.  Even after all this idling, this game is PACKED with money grabs. Everything seems to ask for money to advance quicker. There’s multiple events and tiers which will ask for money to either advance or to buy rolls on dices to continue. If you log in or run out of rolls, you will be spammed with different ways the game will ask you to pay to continue playing.

Back to the basic though, getting dice is NOT easy nor is completing ablums, you have to spend money on it which unfortunately not everyone is able to do like myself but in order to place high most times or get certain things or even dice here to there it does require in game purchases, unfortunate. my biggest request is that you guys as a whole do better to work on making it more fair for those who have been with the game and cant spend but would like to have a fair chance at mini games or dice . also please watch the groupchat they recommend on the game because they SCAM a lot!!! enjoy",Yall asked

In order to advance in the game you need new cards to complete albums and Monopoly won’t come off of them. You can’t compete in tournaments successfully without dice and the 8 dice you earn an hour get you absolutely no where. The prices MonopolyGO charges for the dice packages are insane for the small amount included in them. The wheel boost which gives you another opportunity to earn cards gives the same thing over and over again which is orange pack, green vault, very few dice or a little money which is worthless basically once you have all your 1-3⭐️ cards already.

3,2023-09-22 20:06:29,"Overall this game is very fun and addicting. I like to play it when I am going to sleep as a pass time activity. Unfortunately, the game does some things that make me question why I spend so much time on a rigged game. For example, when you unlock a mega heist - every time you land on the railroad they will give you a showdown instead of a bank heist so you can’t achieve the mega heist. The sticker packs will give you limitless amounts of the same sticker no matter the color of the pack-very deceiving. There is a gold sticker in each pack set and you can’t share them , they are almost impossible to get. As you level up there is no incentive, you get the same amount of dice (50 dice what are you going to do with that?) along with some cash that slightly increases. As you level up, the higher your level the higher it cost to upgrade property- and it’s ridiculous amounts.

Thanks scopely for a crappy game that used to be fun!! And trying to finish the sticker packs is a joke!! Then let’s talk about the gold trades they allow 😂😂 yeah it’s funny. I’m sure there will be tons of people that will finally give up on this game as I have and I devoted no wasted a lot of hours on this stupid game and I would spend actual money on it if I actually got something worth purchasing for a couple of dollars but I will not spend $30 on nothing!!,Worst Game Ever
2,2023-10-12 23:13:09,"So I am currently on board 187. The game itself is very fun to play. However there is a few things I’d personally like to see change. I think there needs to be a safe space for trading stickers, there has been many time on the official page that people get scammed out of their stickers. You reach out to the mods and in the rules they say they will be banned. This is not the case and you never hear back from them about it. Another thing is when you open up sticker packs they should make it a little easier to get cards above 3 stars. Also the trading limit only being at 5 should be raised and you should be able to trade whatever gold cards you want at least 5 times during the new stickers coming out. If you are rolling on a x100 multiplier everything should increase not just the money you get.  Also another issue I see is in the challenges they pair you up with people lower level than you, this make it very hard for people that are low level to even come close to first in challenges (ie they do not get more dice and have to pay to play).",Could Be Better
2,2023-08-31 13:42:08,"In the beginning this game was great. I played it every chance I got. I would never put my phone down, I was addicted. Now the game is deleted from my phone. I hate how you can never get the cards you need without trading. Some of the cards I had to trade for I never even got in a pack EVER in the game. I had 2 cards left that I needed to complete everything. I never got them.  I’m so fed up with this game. You HAVE to spend money to get enough rolls to complete challenges or build cakes, cars, etc.. I’ve spent well over enough money just to not even be able to complete all the sets. I don’t like the fact that you only get a maximum of 7 dice a hour. What am I supposed to do with 7 dice!? I don’t like the fact that when you reach 100+ boards you still only get 50 rolls. We need more rolls for that accomplishment. They need to fix the problem where when you land on a railroad you’ll get shut down multiple times before you get a bank heist. Especially if that is one of your daily objectives.  Ultimately I’m fed up with the game and it’ll never get redownloaded on my phone ever again.",Kind of iffy
1,2023-08-29 13:31:52,"I’ve been playing this game for a couple of months. For the past few weeks I have completed albums 1 through 14,16,&19. I’ve been playing for as long as the event has been going on, 2 days left and I still can’t get the last 8 cards I need because everyone I get a sticker pack I get repeats from packs 1-6 AND I ALREADY FINISHED THOSE!!! so monopoly please stop sending us repeated unnecessary cards and send us the ones we actually need. Another bug I’ve seen going on with my game is when you open the community chest and when you help someone else open it you’re supposed to get 10 rolls and I’m not getting my rolls when someone opens the community chest with my help. Another thing I also hate is I’ve excepted my friends that I want to play within the game, but why am I getting bank heisted and demolished by people who are not my friends? I don’t think this game is fair at all. And as to the stickers I don’t even think there should be a Facebook group to trade. Everyone is rude and everyone scams you from your cards! Find a way to make it fair ! Make sure the scammer can’t use a card until the other trader gets what they also need!!!",Waste of time
5,2023-05-22 23:36:55,"Growing up I used to not like monopoly that much as a kid because of how long a game took. But this game is incredible in every way! This game will make you want to just keep rolling dice and upgrading your city. This is super surprising because most mobile games seem to be boring and overall not fun, but Monopoly Go blows all of those thoughts out of the water! This did something I never thought a mobile game would be able to do, and that is having me excited to upgrade my city! But the thing that really takes the cake is that there is something for everyone! From strategizing how to spend your money to trying to go big while doing a bank heist! Even if you’re like me at first and think “How can this game be that fun, and I don’t even really like monopoly.” I used to have that same mindset but just give it a try and you will be utterly surprised of how much fun it is. #Thisgamesurprisedme",Incredibly addicting and surprisingly fun!
4,2023-08-08 06:25:19,"I do play daily. I have fun with it from time to time. However it’s probably the biggest money grab of any mobile game in existence. The game is based around these stickers. Not the gameplay, not the events not upgrading to new boards. It’s a grab to spend the most money possible to get these stickers packs. Then there is of course your luck. You have to land on railroads to play into the events. I know for me I spent 2100 dice to land on the railroad twice. You spend all this money to get these packs. To just get duplicates of stickers you can’t even trade (gold stickers). Or you just get constant duplicates of the same sticker over and over. They want you to trade stickers, but limit you to 5 a day. There is even a prompt to join their trading page on Facebook. If you want to be able to play the game to its fullest you need to spend money. There is no way around it. If you do play please watch out for the people that just trade to scam you out your stickers.",Money grab/stickers run the game
4,2023-07-27 01:28:38,This game has great potential but you guys really need to get some stuff figured out. For one there's been multiple times that the dice say one thing but my token does not move that many. Secondly you do not offer enough dice rolls and cash for board completion. At least have the rewards grow as you move up every few. Next the cards are ridiculous. I should not be having to spend money and THEN still get no new cards or getting multiple of the golden cards and not being able to trade them. There should be at least once a month or something we can trade golden cards. The cards really out of walk. You have people out here SELLING 5 star cards and less for actual $$$ that is absolutely crazy. The game also has no way of communicating with your in game friends for trading. Not everyone is linked or wanted to go through facebook when there are tons of scammers. Please fix these issues and I promise you'll have a ton of happier players.,Wonderful game but come on.
2,2023-09-24 14:00:19,"This game is rigged, people who aren't your friend can bank heist you for the BIGGEST amount of your money, actually they can take almost all of your money in one bank heist, and you can’t even get back at them, and always happens overnight. All the bank heists that I’ve got from my friends are for the thousands and maybe 1M, but they take over 70 MILLIONS from me, quite UNFAIR if you ask me because you can’t even retaliate against them, how come you can only bank heist your friends, but a total stranger can bank heist you?!?!? PATHETIC. Also I bought $20 worth of dice rolls with the first purchase bonus and after a few dice rolls my entire bonus disappeared, over a thousand dice rolls opportunities. Yes the game is fun but it is frustrating and I’m not willing to spend another dime on this game anymore for a total stranger to take all my money in one bank heist without me getting back at them and for my dice rolls to disappear after I bought them. Edit. And of course after contacting customer service they couldn’t do anything about how my bonus for first time purchase disappeared.",RIGGED
3,2023-09-12 20:25:52,"While the game is fun and has temporary satisfaction, it is very clear that this game was made to target people with addictive personalities. They make it so that once you run out of dice, they thrown a ton of “deals” and offers at you, mind you, you get a cap on your dice rolls and to refill without paying anything takes literally 24 hours. Now I am aware that it is a game, and you should play responsibly, but it is very hard for some to do. The game makes it almost impossible to actually accomplish the events without spending money, and I’m not talking $1 or $2 (because there’s nothing in game that cheap) I’m talking $20+ and you’ll be lucky to even land on the spots you need to accomplish these events, these event end every few days and you have to KEEP spending just to hold your position or get all the rewards within the time frame.. I myself had to delete this app because I was a slave to these in-app purchases! If you are like me, my advice is DO NOT download this app, otherwise, kudos to you 🤘🏽",***Warning for addictive personalities***
4,2023-09-10 18:35:38,"This is very ADDICTIVE game and I love it. But when it comes to the stickers it’s very annoying. With almost new packs of stickers I get it’s the same one. Very rarely I get new ones I need. Also I wish it was possible to have an option to trade in a certain amount of stickers to get the gold stickers or any other stickers we need. Not the pre-generated stickers.  And also the fact that when we complete boards give us something more than certain amounts of dice and money. Like for example if an event is going one give us stuff for the event. And if it isn’t any event going on give us more dices by increasing the amount we get. When it comes to replacing dices either give us more within the hour or shorten the time by a lot. It’s crazy to wait for an hour just for 8 dices to come.   Last, these past few days of playing this game I’ve noticed that it’s been lagging and or I’m not getting the right amount stuff I’m supposed to be getting.",Some possible updates
5,2023-08-25 16:15:40,"This game was fun initially but now after you get so far you don’t get the stickers you need nor chances for more dice! Do better Monoply Go!

Not fun when you can’t get what you want AND spend money too! Yep I’m over it! You lured people in and now it’s just a money hole ****update***This is pure sickening when you read screenshots where people will send you a sticker for nude pics of yourself!!!! 🤬 Monopoly Go do better!!!! I haven’t had a new stickers in days all dups that aren’t more than 3 stars! Spent money which is pathetic…..I can’t believe an they have done this to a game that has been loved and played by almost all generations!

2,2023-11-06 14:09:34,Enjoyed the game at first but it’s hard to enjoy with only 80 dice as max limit…why not just have it where we continue to accumulate dice every hour without a limit or at least a higher limit…the events are great but how can we enjoy them when one has to spend more than the game to be able to roll…not going to lie I have spent a couple hundred on this game but it’s not worth it when I’m risking my dice for a higher pot and one is not receiving back what I’m putting into the game…I like doing the albums but it’s hard to win the mini competitions when the hackers/cheaters are rigging game and one that actually putting in effort to win can never win a decent pack of cards to finish an album….also why once one spend $100 the game never shows the deals for $20 every deal is literally $100 on my account like I’m not spending $100 everything I play this game…like I said it was fun at the beginning but now Monopoly Go seems like a bill one don’t want to pay….do better I would love to continue to play but at this rate y’all are losing customers/players,Overrated
3,2023-10-12 17:50:47,"The core gameplay is fun. But there are some pretty scummy practices…   1) Every time you run out of rolls, and I mean EVERY TIME that you don’t have enough dice to roll at your current multiplier, there are at least 2 pop-ups asking you to spend money for more. Because this game gives you dice fairly frequently through gameplay; I’ve had multiple sessions where I have to press the “x” on the multiple pop-ups at least 6 times within one session. Did I mention that the “x” is in a different place on all three popups so you have to find it?  2) One of the many pop-ups asks for access to your contacts stating that it’ll use this to help add friends. It even incentivizes this with 30 dice. You don’t need my contacts information with addresses, birthdays, first and last names, phone numbers, emails, etc.  3) Kind of piggy backing off the last point, you are automatically opted in to selling your personal information. You can shut this setting off, thankfully but this is kind of gross to think of. Paired with my second issue, you can see how they can make some serious money off not just your data, but the data for other people that you provide.  With all that being said, the game is still fun. If you can handle hitting “x” on the popups that you see more frequently than your parents, and opt out of information mining (this includes not granting access to contacts or Facebook), then you should be golden. Fun game with blatant, gross business practices.",Pop-Ups Galore
4,2023-09-28 12:53:57,"I love this game, very addicting, have a bunch of family & friends playing but so many things that aren’t fair. You should be able to share gold cards with friends, even if it’s just 1 a week or so, the same cards kerp coming over and over, it’s tiresome. Not enough dice to keep playing unless you want to pay and that’s not fair at all. The mega heist goes away too fast & you go around the board do many times but just get shut downs not heists, same for No Parking, will hit that over & over except when the reward is available, can’t land on it. Pege needs to come up more and the special games should be longer than 4 or 5 days, or else not such a high number that’s almost impossible to reach. The game is definitely entertaining but the higher you get the harder it is to afford to increase landmarks because money needed is so high.

5,2023-10-08 15:35:22,"Hi, I love monopoly go it’s a cool fun game where you get to play with your friends and enjoy it and try to beat everyone else but sometimes there’s a lot of things that are wrong with the game like glitches or lag and it’s makes the game not fun when that happens. I’m going to list some of the glitches in the game. First they have a lot of animations in the game and that sometimes can make the game lag say if I wanna click to go build more things on my map but I can’t because I have to wait because I have to open the prizes first and then I can do that’s kind of not good because I just click onto the prizes when I want to and claim them instead of having to wait and also there’s a lot of animations so there needs to be less of that because it’s kind of making it lag and it’s just too much so thank you and I hope you read this so you can fix it.","It’s a good game, it needs some fixing."
2,2023-10-30 02:02:06,"When I first started playing, I was playing constantly throughout the day but the longer I play the more I think about deleting my app and telling others not to waste there time on it. You get 7 dice an hour, what are we going to do with that?! The more you progress in the game the more dice you should get an hour instead of making us buy dice that are ridiculously high, in todays economy who can afford that? The stickers we get from packs are always the same ones over and over we should get a new card with each board completed or at least every other one completed. The amount needed to complete events is so high and when you spin the wheel you get low numbers, if you are using 100 or 200 per spin you should really be able to complete these events but it’s like almost every time I land on some stupid number like 80 or 200? Fix this game and make it more enjoyable and not about always trying to get us to spend money (all the pop ups are ridiculous and infuriating) or I’m sure your going to start losing customers!!",Disappointing
3,2023-10-19 01:11:54,"This game is fun when the rewards match the hard work you put in. The challenges and events are the best part. HOWEVER, it makes no sense I get the same cards everyday for months and even when I go hard to win challenges I still only get the same ole stuff and you can’t trade Hold and the ones I have everyone have I have a group and sadly we all need the exact same cards and can’t help each other as we should be able to and we are from all over the world. It feels like you must be a billionaire in real life to have what you need in this game. Play faithfully but I’m stuck. I got my uncle addicted to this game and we all work hard to help each other but their isn’t anything we can do at this point but log in everyday just to collect rolls. We can’t collect stickers. I’m glad the other day they allowed Bog Booty to be shared I just wish there was more consideration for the game lovers who have been faithful to the game.

4,2023-09-28 18:18:13,"I’m real lying enjoying this game, however there are a few things that I do not like. 1st is the fact that computer players keep beating me in tournaments.I can’t help it if there isn’t any real players in at the time of the tournament to compete with me. There is no way that I’m in first place, I roll the dice land on an advancement, but fall back 3 places on the leader board. That is insane. 2nd it’s not totally RNG, because I can clearly see a pattern when rolling the dice. If I need to land on a spot, the game will make me land one spot in front, or behind that spot too often. Also when I have many rolls the game makes me miss landing on target spots more then when I have fewer rolls. I believe this is done so that I can’t accumulate rolls for free, which would make a person want to spend money to continue rolling. 3rd we need better ways to complete albums. I have mostly all albums complete but receiving the same cards over and over again is tiring and gets a bit boring.",Tournaments
2,2023-09-27 12:08:18,"I understand that the purpose of this game is to make money for the creators. No argument there. I don’t mind in-app purchases, but what I think is dishonest and unfair is that as soon as you make one purchase all of your other purchase prices go up. My husband and I started playing about the same time. I have purchased several small packs on my account, while he has not purchased any. Now all of my packs and options in the store are considerably higher than his with fewer dice and lower stickers—-even though we are about the same net worth. For example, on the previous set, his cost for a guaranteed sticker pack was $29…my cost for the same pack was $99!!!! Customer service support was not helpful at all and said that’s just how it is depending on how much you play. When instead, they should be rewarding people who spend in-app instead of punishing them. So until monopoly changes that, I will not be making any future purchases. You shouldn’t punish those who support you by making you pay more to get less.",Taking the Pay-to-Play experience to an all new low
2,2023-11-06 03:25:49,"Scopely came out with an awesome game. It’s fun and exciting especially the notion that you are competing with your friends and family. But why promote the game as family friendly fun when every challenge requires a purchase in order to be in the competition for a decent prize. The Album collection  is a JOKE. It is chuck full of duplicate stickers and I have went thru thousands without receiving certain stickers. The GOLD CARD trade is laughable, most times I can only trade stickers that I don’t even have. I will continue to play, but I have decided not to spend another penny while playing because no matter how much I spend, the goals are not attainable except for minor prizes. I understand the desire to make huge profits, but playing a game that feels like you are making no progress will teach you to keep your money in your pocket. Additionally, I feel that the game is full of autobots that encite action and promote purchases because “if I buy a few more dice, I might make it to 1st place”. Don’t fool yourselves.

When you do manage to get them you spin the wheel an every single time you get 40 points, 60 points, 80 points, you may get 1400 aday. That’s not alot when you need 75,000 points to finish. You hardly get the 200 points, 300 points, 1000 points. This game is very fixed. They want you to purchase & I just not going to do that. I was buying stuff until I started figuring out their stingy!  Also if your friends don’t help you their is nothing you can do. We lost two days of game play they hardly gave us any pieces to play with. Then they should make it, we can switch partners of ours are not helping at all.

4,2023-09-10 11:59:56,"I understand games need to make money to continue to stay up. The issue is “guaranteed” missing card packs do not always give guarantees cards needed.

I have read lots of complaints about this series being harder to complete sets, harder to get dice. Some fun is taken away and replaced with added frustration. I do love the game and it’s addicting. The issue is eventually if I feel like the only way to succeed is to spend. Well then I won’t be able to keep the game. The economy isn’t in the place where the average person has extra for a game.

3,2023-09-11 20:53:43,"Absolutely love the game, however per most free apps, it comes with in app purchases. At a certain obtained level/board level (around 100) it becomes almost impossible to advance in any aspect of the game without making purchases. My complaint is I have finally found a game that has kept my interest, but I’m slowly losing interest not being able to advance one board for up to two weeks at a time! I’m a broke single momma I can’t afford loose change even on a game! Also the special events are hard to accomplish in the 5 days given, if you aren’t purchasing from the app. If you’re a regular monopoly go user, 7 to 10 days would be ideal for those events! This game could use many improvements and changes for less fortunate! However overall it’s an awesome , yet addictive game!

If they actually cared about their fan base, they would do something about this but they make it obvious that they don’t, it’s only about money.  The sticker albums are so frustrating. They make it nearly impossible to get the stickers that you need and only give you duplicates of very low value cards or cards that you can’t trade (gold cards).   Lastly, the Facebook group that they advertise for reading stickers is nothing but a big scam. They allow people in the group to break the rules and don’t do anything when you report them.

5,2023-07-06 16:49:22,I’ve been playing for a while now and it seems that the game can’t catch up to the level that I’m on. I don’t normally build my town until I have enough money to build but yet it shows that I’m still on a town that I’m not on. For example. I’m on level 66 but the game thinks I’m on level 44. Also I was playing this morning a ranked fourth in a tournament and was supposed to be awarded 600 dice and it never gave them to me. No matter what I consider this to be one of my favorite games. It’s right up there with Coin Master. Whoever designed it really does need to update their software and fix the problem. Since the latest update yesterday it continues to kick me out of the game multiple times and an error message pops up. I’ve been up 500K three times and every time the game kicks me out I lose all my money. U know how long it takes to get that much money in this game? Awhile. Not cool,Game needs updating

Then it was about to let me claim them and then the game glitched and kicked me out. I did not receive the rewards I was supposed to. I would like these to be given to me or something. It’s very annoying.   TOO EXPENSIVE   I enjoy playing this game, but when your run out of dice, it takes forever to get dice. I have considered buying dice, but the prices are too ridiculous. I would consider it if the prices dropped, but not with the way they are. I am not in a financial spot to be able to afford buying dice at those prices, and I know a lot people that aren’t. I know the devs want to make money, but I think if you lower the prices more people would buy dice and other stuff.  PAY TO WIN  As I mentioned earlier it is not easy to get dice. If you want to spend lots of money, this is the game for you.  STICKERS  It starts off by giving you lots of stickers, but once you get a certain amount it takes for ever to get stickers.

3,2023-09-17 01:48:07,Even though it’s very repetitive it can become very addictive. Which is ok but some challenges it can take a while to reach milestones and sometimes it can start after you reach the first couple of them. Believe now they are trying to make people spend more to reach the milestones. It’s even really hard to get the stickers now even if you buy expensive packages. Then they raised how many stars you need to trade your stickers on there to get a lockbox which still doesn’t give you the stickers you need. Can trade on Facebook but won’t be able to finish lots of sets cause you can’t trade gold stickers which hold to get. Just spent maybe a couple hundreds in the past couple of weeks which was my choice and not complaining about it. Just when you can get addicted and use what you brought within in hour than want to buy more. So I had to delete because would rather games that you don’t have to spend that much to enjoy and not time consuming.,Can Get Really Addictive and Expenisive
1,2023-08-06 06:04:49,This game starts out fun but after just a little while it becomes more aggravating than anything! It’s not about the costumers with this game. It’s all intended to get u to spend ur own money playing their game. After so long of playing it’s hard to get rolls and the stickers u need to complete sets! All u will get is duplicate stickers. Then once ur even further to complete sets u must do it without anyone sending u any stickers so therefore I can forget about getting the stickers u need. I’m sure if ur willing to spend hundreds of dollars u may be able to get them. This game is so rigged and they have made sure that without spending money u will never get the stuff u need. I loved it at first but quickly began to see wat the developers were all about with this game! I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who don’t wanna spend money on a game because to get anywhere or get anything u need u will have to spend ur money. Thumbs down to the developers who made this game for not allowing people the chance to achieve the goals without spending money. It’s a scam people so don’t do it. They say it’s all fair gaming but that is not true.,Over Rated
5,2023-06-09 15:26:17,"I started playing a few weeks ago and I really love the game, however it is very annoying the amount of pop-ups that happen each time I open the game as well as complete a board. I don’t think it is necessary to have so many pop ups to purchase dice all at once like that, if someone wants to spend money they will. It seems like a trick for users to accidentally click and make a purchase. Also since the new stickers came out yesterday I am experiencing way more bugs, such as today my daily gift days 0s left to open but it will not let me open it. Yesterday I received a reward for 0 stickers… I think some changes need to happen because it’s frustrating to not only me, but so many users are complaining in the Facebook sticker trading group.

It’s such a money grab game now it’s not even fun to play. The most recent event I had 7,000 saved up and I still couldn’t complete it. Instead of being 60,000 it’s 80,000 to complete.

You would make more if you let the game be fun again and people weren’t so frustrated that they quit and delete the game. You’ve made the stickers harder to get. People won’t trade or want actual money to trade cards people need. People scam people all the time. The higher you get the less you get. It’s not fun anymore. I doubt you’ll read this . You haven’t listened to anything that people had to say up to this point. And have in fact made the game harder to play and enjoy. So for what it’s worth good luck. Avoid this game it not worth it.",Why make it so difficult?
2,2023-09-27 07:06:48,"I used to love playing this game. I still like being able to play with my friends. But it isn't as fun as it used to. The last couple updates have really changed things. I'm on level 123. It's taking a lot of money to build my map. I don't get as many rolls as I used to. I used to be able to play 20 minutes at a time, sometimes getting upwards of 2000 dice at a time. Now, I never get as many dice from events that go on. The second to last baking challenge they had I got really close to finishing. This last baking challenge I didn't get anywhere close. Every time I spun the wheel, it gave me really crappy rolls. I'm also really unhappy with the card packs. They are making it impossible to get gold cards. And I don't get cards with higher stars almost at all anymore, and when I do they are always ones that I already have. It has gotten to the point where you have to pay upwards of $5000 to get anywhere in this game. The creators have started monopolizing monopoly go, and it's just not any fun anymore. A lot of people are disappointed.",Used to be fun
1,2023-06-25 02:38:57,"This app deviates significantly from the classic board game, aside from the basic mechanics of rolling dice and moving around the board. While one would anticipate enhanced features inspired by the traditional game, the developers attempted to incorporate too many elements, resulting in a lack of coherence. For instance, the necessity of others' involvement to open the community chest seems unnecessary, considering it is traditionally a stack of cards in the physical game. Additionally, the purpose of stickers and the inclusion of railroads to steal and knock down other players remains unclear, although explanations can be found on the website. This departure from the expected experience left me rather perplexed. I had initially anticipated a traditional game with the added twist of playing with either familiar or unknown individuals. However, the app takes the concept to a different level, which, regrettably, didn't resonate with me. While initially enjoyable, the game tends to become repetitive within a week's time. Furthermore, the account deletion process has proven to be quite cumbersome, as I am still awaiting its completion.",Deviation from tradition is a disappointing departure from a classic board game.
1,2023-09-07 19:08:57,"Yes I love this game and it can be addicting however it does force you to spend money on buying things to keep playing! & when you do run out of dice you only get less then 10 dice per hour! I feel like the dice should refill the total amount every hour instead of just little amounts. This causes you not being able to increase your multiplier by much and not getting the rewards at a good pace.   The mini games they have ( cake bakes, building cars,) are so much fun ! But when you do get enough tokens to play those games and are relying on a wheel to see how many points can go towards those games, ITS RIGGED. I’ve had 500 of the tokens and increased my multiplier by 100 tokens per roll and EVERY TIME I land on the small numbers. I have yet landed on a good number. They only give you a certain amount of time to complete these items & yet you can’t ever get the points you need to finish … therefore causing you to go and spend more money to buy more dice to get tokens just to get little points. This game seriously needs a new update. We all love it but they could definitely fix certain areas!",Great game but many flaws
3,2023-08-28 08:48:20,So the game is fun and addictive. The big thing I have a issue with is the stickers. The group on Facebook just doesn’t work people are literally selling for real money and there is also scamming there needs to be something else to hold people to the trade maybe another app idk but the stickers need to be redone. Now with getting new stickers I think we all understand that it’s a chance of getting new stickers but at the same time when you open 10 packs and don’t get 1 new sticker to me that’s a little low chance maybe the rmg needs to be upped or mine is just terrible I’ll continue playing but please fix the way trading stickers works. And maybe put in the tos that selling the stickers for real money could and should get you banned. And for the last thing I really hate to say this but for people who can’t afford to buy more dice maybe have ads we can watch to get a few. Now I’m not saying that every 2 rolls there needs to be an ad I’m saying if we need dice we can watch an ad.,My opinion
1,2023-09-27 04:46:48,"Absolutely addicted to the game and love the game itself. Unfortunately I have officially deleted said game for multiple reasons. It’s too money motivated and is DESIGNED to push people into their wallets and I’ve never used the word rigged before but I truly believe that this game is rigged and unfair purposefully. Also, it’s very unorthodox to continue to give people 50 dice and maybe a hundred million when they finish a board and that amount never goes up for us even if the price to finish a board or get out of jail goes up significantly as we level up. Also, I get that you can only give so many dice out but waiting on 8 dice an hour that will be spent in a matter of literal SECONDS is kind of ridiculous and should also go up a little more significantly as we level up as well. This design will make you creators money for the moment but eventually (starting now) people are going to realize they have bills to pay and kids to feed and they aren’t going to be able yo get anywhere on this game and they are going to either forget about it or delete it. Fix it! It’s been a good run all! ✌🏼",Too money motivated and unfair
3,2023-09-05 03:39:27,"This game is no different than multiple other games on the App Store such as coin master, for prime example. However this game does it better, and in my opinion is more fun. I wish dice were easier to come by. There should be more daily challenges to earn more dice to increase play value. The biggest change I would like to see, is a way to see your friends cards. (If there is a way I’m not aware of it). It would be nice if you could just invite a friend to a trade, and it shows you cards they need that you have, and cards they have that you need, instead I find myself having to keep track of the cards I need and figure out what they need to make a good trade. This makes it very annoying to trade cards with someone if you’re not in person, or on the phone. If that feature or something similar was added, I would increase my rating to 4 stars. The only reason it’s not 5, is because it’s just another freemium game, like others previously mentioned.",A few changes I’d like to see
5,2023-10-22 18:25:22,"Listen, I’m pretty much addicted to this game. I love it, BUT y’all make it very aggravating. 7 dice rolls an hour… where am i gonna go with that? and max it out at 70 rolls? (at least at the level i’m at). It would be a lot more fun if we could accumulate more rolls in an hour or more in a day. I’ve already spent way too much money on this game.. again i’m addicted. Also, the stickers, why haven’t a received a new sticker in weeks?!! It would be great if you guys handed out stickers a bit more evenly. I have many many 1 star stickers that I have 5+ of, but I have not received a new sticker since who knows when. No one is getting new stickers, it’s like a bar fight in monopoly sticker trade groups when someone happens to have an extra 4 or 5 star sticker. Again, I love this game but it would be great if some of the things in these reviews could be addressed.","LOVE the game, BUT it needs some tweaks"
3,2023-05-18 13:19:41,"Ok I absolutely love playing this game, I play it a lot throughout the day, but it does have a few flaws. Number one is the dice it takes too long to receive just five dice, I think it should fully rest after waiting for an hr, and them when your rolling multiple like I do x20 or more, life you land on chance and it gives you 30 dice and at the bottom of the screen it shows our multiply but only gives you 30 it should multiply. Number two, when you are rolling at a higher multiplier it’s harder to land on the railroads so you use up all your dice trying. Last but not least the sticker collection, it does not give hardly anything it’s always the same cards so it difficult to complete even though you can trade cards with friends or on Facebook half the time nobody helps you and you can’t gift the gold card so why is it we are able to get multiple of them. The game would be amazing if these things were fixed so that’s why I give it a 3 star",Love the game but has some flaws
1,2023-11-07 17:25:02,First of all let’s start this by saying I was obsessed with this game to begin with. It was fun and an overall great game. After playing for sometime they make the game impossible to progress or earn rewards or to even have the dice to roll. People all over the game scam others out of hard earned stickers that took months to get. You have to spend a fortune to buy dice just to enjoy the game and they over price the packs to buy as well. Not worth spending thousands of dollars to get 50 dice and have it gone in a matter of minutes and never land on anything worth while. This game is a waste of time and not even enjoyable anymore. The earnable stickers are impossible to get and you never end up completing the sticker sets unless you trade and it’s too sketchy to trade because of people saying they’ll give what you need then running off without doing their send to you then the stickers that you do need to complete are the gold stickers and the chances of actually getting one you need is 1 in 100 million unless you BUY them yet again and they charge outrageous prices for that too.,Greedy
3,2023-10-31 06:32:15,So I love this game it’s very addicting and what not BUT the cons of this game is the duplicate stickers are getting so old. Even on the mega pack and it’s very disappointing how you get the first of every tournament and sometimes even purchase bundles to just get a duplicate card! And then to wait and hour for 8 rolls only. That’s insane.  I mean if we are some what getting similar to these other stimulation game like piggy go you might as well let us buy our sticker pack just like the other games are letting us buy our chest for cards. Because I mean we already see the update on more sticker bundle and trading so might as well just throw that in there where we can use our Monopoly money to buy sticker packs! It’s only fair if we are getting duplicate cards.. other than that the game is great and fun to only a short time until you run out of dice then tough luck! But overall it’s addicting and a great game to play. It just has his cons which something should be took at least in consideration !,Love it but…..
1,2023-10-23 13:40:47,"I am getting absolutely sick of playing mobile games, having an alright time, just to either be forced to wait hours for more rolls, or spend real Money. If you played pretty much any mobile game, it’s the EXACT same template. Easy, and somewhat fun gameplay with bright lights and lots of action to get you hooked. Once you’re hooked the game progression takes much longer or requires you to spend real life money to continue progressing to the next level. In addition to that, they dangle these sticker albums advising that if you complete them, you get more rolls. Funny enough, any sticker pack you get is almost always full of duplicates. Also, conveniently whenever there is a tournament or event, your piece almost never lands on railroads or needed event tiles whenever you have high multipliers on, but when you have none your piece lands on them like crazy. They have the skeleton of a fun game, but at the end of the day it is yet another pay for play game once you get past 10 boards. It’s predatory and disgusting behavior, and I think politicians should get involved in matters like these",Predatory pay for play
4,2023-08-18 14:51:18,So I play the game daily currently on board 92 but I have more suggestions for changes than anything... 1. Too many pop ups when u open the game it's like 5 pay for reward options then your friends standings and etc....it's too much it feels like it takes a good 2 mins of closing those before I can play....  2. Waiting an hour to get so few spins...that's dumb...I'm not paying for your spins if anything I've started to play less because that's just stupid I get you want money but give people 20 spins at least if we wait an hour...dumb rule  3. The sticker algorithm is also ridiculous and could use some tweaking. I've been playing for a good month and there's a goal to get to 189 stickers and I'm at 171...but for about 2-3 weeks I haven't gotten a new sticker...again I play daily....u can't trade gold ones and the monopoly trade group is full of scammers--the sticker trading needs some tweaking....there needs to be a way to trade gold stickers but also not complete a trade until both people have traded...like an option to view Whats being traded and accept before sending because I've been scammed out of stickers I sent people but they didn't send me the one they were supposed to.   4. The rare mini games frustrated me--I build three cars completely out of 4 and got nothing at the end..what was the point...  Overall the game is cool to pass time but there are lots of fixes.,It's alright
3,2023-10-03 14:54:40,I went to the link on MonopolyGO IG story and it reloaded my app the load was longer than usual but I waited when it came back on everything I did for my partners and I were GONE! All the puzzle pieces and dice GONE ! The stickers I had got gone I know all this because I was going to the group for trades so I screen shotted everything before that restart over 1.4B GONE ! 1.3k puzzle pieces GONE! 937 dice GONE! Also I didn’t get my past 4x100 rolls back I did before the restart . This is crazy people spend too much money on this game and time for things like this to happen I was already mad at the fact I couldn’t close my sets because I only needed gold stars and didn’t get any 4 weeks and still haven’t gotten any which was why I was screen shooting going to the trading group any way! THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND I NEED TO BE REFUNDED THIS IS NIT FAIR TO MYSELF OR ANY OF MY 4 PARTNERS IN THIS TOURNAMENT! People spend too much money on this app and after spending over $200 myself and not getting a fair game is ridiculous FIX IT !,Mandatory RESTART
3,2023-08-18 05:07:47,"This app was amazing at first (or so I thought). It does sort of force you to be more internet social for sure. However, there is no real advancement and that the disappointing part. 😞 Even if you pay money for dice and/or stickers, it doesn’t change the odds at all. I’m currently on week 2 if receiving not ONE new card. I’ve only received duplicates, or gifts from friends. The 7 dice per hour thing is absolutely absurd. Please make it 50, and make the board advancement reward 100. It’s more fair in my opinion. Also, I don’t understand why we HAVE to add friends, when strangers can play on your board as well. At least create an option for us to add the strangers, or block them. Lastly, give more stars for gold cards. It’s weird that both them and other cards are both five stars, but you can’t gift the gold ones. Make them worth more then.  This was a great concept, but please listen to the fan base before we all just eventually stop playing, or delete the app all together.",Disappointing
5,2023-05-20 01:23:34,"I am obsessed with this game and I highly recommend it! It’s fun, rewarding, and I can spend hours playing. There’s a couple things I wish would come out with future updates: 1. When you trade stickers through the Facebook group there’s a lot of “scamming” happening. I think the game should implement a system where both players have to attach the card before the swap is completed.  2. You should get more dice than 5-6/hour. A lot of people don’t have the money to spend on the game and it can leave you waiting all day to actually be able to play. It would be cool if you got even 2 dice every time you passed go.  3. Some of the sticker packs are impossible to complete without spending actual money on the game, it shouldn’t work that way.  4. This is more of a question but why would we receive duplicate gold cards when we can’t even trade/gift them.",Obsessed
3,2023-06-26 23:46:14,"This game has our whole family playing through multiple states. It has become an inside joke. Parents, siblings, nephews, in-laws, and if it wasn’t because downloading the app cost it would also be in our kids ($&-) tablets so they could join us.   I completely understand that you need to make money. As fun and addictive as it can be we have even paid for upgrades. However, giving only 50 dice to anyone past certain levels is ridiculous, especially when upgrading a building cost billions.   You need to consider balancing the rewards as people advance so the earnings when people land on those can afford the upgrades. If I am at level 10k and about 230+ (land development) why can you at least give the same amount of dice? If someone is paying for whatever are the offers why not let them also earn the cards they need more often instead repeat (gold) non-tradeable? The vault star exchanges are not even worth it. I traded 1500 and 500 risked good gold and even on demand cards to get nothing worth in return.    I reported a glitch delay in rewards and even your CS had to be proven wrong with me having to point out stamp timed. To then receive 30 dices as an apology. Look at the accounts of your customers, to better analyze and actually provide a satisfactory  resolution process. Specially to notice those paying customers.

3,2023-06-19 16:02:30,"So I’ve been playing for a few weeks now! im completely addicted! I do enjoy the game.  i will say, if you’d like to keep players like me addicted, make the dice easier to get, as well as some of the trading cards. It seems once you get soo many sets closed, you don’t get any new cards to continue closing the sets. All you get is the same cards over and over again. If you trade the extra cards in, you get those same cards you just traded trying to get something better! For the dice, you get 7 dice every hour? thats insane. At least give enough dice every hour to be able to play more than just a few rolls! Another issue I’m not to happy with is, you going to sit there and tell me all these doubles I roll the whole time I’m playing, but as soon as I land myself in jail, I dont roll a single double to get out of jail free? theres no way, I roll all these doubles every other roll, but can’t get a double in jail. Some bugs need to be worked out or higher dice rewards during the tournaments.",Monopoly go!
4,2023-09-23 12:04:46,"I enjoy playing monopoly. Sometimes I think it can be a little addicting. However, the game tends to be a little unfair at times. I understand the randomness of the cards you get but I don’t like how you cannot obtain a high card from a low star pack. In the last album you had a low chance of getting a high card you need from the lower packs. but 1 lucky pack is all you need. That has changed and you have to zone in on each star pack to get what you need.   My biggest pain point with the game is “bots” stealing all the money I have in bank heists. It would be more understanding if it were my friends doing the heist but it’s always a “person” I’m not friends with in the game. Shutdowns can be done on random people but heists are always on friends. So how is it that a different random “person” steals all my money every day? I think monopoly has a great game but the fairness needs to be fixed expeditiously!",The game is fun until it’s not
4,2023-08-26 00:24:00,"This is a great game and everyone has jumped on the bandwagon. Regarding the stickers I have a ton of the same stickers over 20 plus and the trading on the facebook group is not very good they post thing they have to trade but when you post what you need it crickets no replies. Why can’t you make it where we can trade with the friends that we play with. We have the opportunity to steal from their bank, destroy their property, pay them rent so why can’t we trade with them. It would be so much easier. Making a purchase does not give any new stickers the same one over and over again. Playing to pay and still not getting new stickers is not bad way to keep people playing. Purchased dice and stickers. Got 8 stickers each time and none new. Please make an update for the next sticker album to trade between the friends you’re playing with and not the facebook group as some are scams  Thank you",Great game but not very good for stickers
1,2023-09-03 17:04:25,"The game was cool at 1st .. I caught it about 2 months in on the second album , completed in about a week . Suddenly the game popularity shot THROUGH THE ROOF , the groups on Facebook even got huge && then it literally became all about money .

Don’t believe the bot looking profiles that leave nice reviews && comments believe me they are most def bots . They tell you compete in the tournament but they throw bots in the tournament so you buy dice to compete with it (I didn’t believe at 1st until I stopped playing for hrs && I’d just watch the tournament scores , even when I was in 50th place , the #1 would only move whenever I rolled && moved up).

Ya should switch the vault prices back to the original prices as before now it’s like triple we need 2500 stars just to get a pink vault that’s ridiculous.

Ya definitely made the game harder and all I know is I run out of dice so fast within a day but if I don’t play at all for a couple days to collect dice that isn’t enough either. Instead of keep gifting us stickers we don’t need we should be gifted with stickers we are missing. I will start a petition if the game gets worst.

2,2023-07-05 18:03:54,"I will say that at first I had downloaded this game for nostalgic reasons after being invited by my partner. It is immediately fun and captivating and I will admit that I did spend about $10 whenever hourly deals would come around. The boards are very creative and offer you the chance to knock down other boards to gain more income and even steal from the banks of other players. You can add friends into the game and trade stickers and help each other get to different goals. It is very addictive and admittedly hard to put down.  However at about 9 AM EST, several thousands of other members of the trading group that is recommended by the app, including me,Has lost our connection to the game and have not been able to get the game to load for more than 10 minutes at a time.

Said my friend robbed me for so much more money than it really was (I sat right beside her and saw how much she got vs how much was missing from my account). My advice is give people an option to watch ads for a certain amount of dice. Don’t cap the videos. Don’t put restrictions on it. 10 dice for 30 second ad etc. Literally no reason it should be this hard. If you’re thinking about downloading I suggest joining discussion groups and seeing what they have to say about how buggy it is because it really is buggy.

Unless you are willing to continually spend a lot of money good luck getting dice. There are no ads in the game so they make money by charging high prices for dice packs. The game allows you to earn up to 8 dice per hour and the cap is 80 dice. You can earn dice in events but it takes more dice to win the prize than the prize is worth. The sticker albums are a good way to get dice in theory but the practicality isn’t matching up.  It’s extremely hard to get 5 star stickers and gold stickers cannot be traded. The game continually gives you the same stickers in the sticker packs. Duplicate stickers can be traded or turned in for vaults. The vaults often give you duplicate stickers as well which defeats the purpose of trading them in. The official trading group is basically unmonitored.

2,2023-09-03 03:49:43,I was high on the boards In the 120s and then when I returned to the game I found I was down on the boards 112. And the multiplier was not giving the correct number and I never got any cards except a few here and there.  They need to rethink their game.   You might be lucky to get the winnings it says you get. If your out of shields you never seem to land on them until your mostly out of dice. The higher you go the faster the shields go down faster. Opposite of what they tell you. Then the money to improve the property gets bigger and higher. Basically making you wait and or buying their packages. I find this happens the higher you go. It’s a fun game but getting out of hand at this point. You have a better chance buying their packages for dice then landing on the board and scoring the points needed to gain any dice. Not sure if I’ll keep it and I’m seeing that if you delete the game they keep your avatar icon etc and use it. I know a few people who no longer use it and they still have their icon etc.,Update: Game has gotten ridiculous
2,2023-10-31 20:01:16,"Okay, yes this game can be “fun” for anyone looking to kill sometime and indirectly play with friends. The rest of this review is aimed towards the developers / publishers of this app. We understand you need to make a buck off this game. Overall it’s polished, the boards are creative, the events are engaging to an extent and there’s a fair amount of variety each week that keeps most people entertained. HOWEVER Why do we need to be bombarded with pop ups every time the game is launched or whenever a player runs out of dice? It’s overwhelming how often an offer for an in-game purchase appears. It’s clearly designed to give players just enough enjoyment before you throw an offer in their face. The dopamine triggers are all over this “game” to a sickening degree. Trust me, you’re going to make money off your product. You don’t need to display offers for players to spend cash every single time the game is played. Hats off to the software engineers who carefully programmed these triggers to function similar to a slot machine. The Monopoly Man would be proud.",Death by Pop-Ups
1,2023-07-31 01:34:34,"This game tries so hard to try and MAKE you spend money on it. I respect the hustle, but I’m not wasting my hard earned money on a game when the sticker packs are full of useless repeats and no new stickers at all. If there was a sticker pack that FOR SURE had only new stickers in it, I might would be willing to spend the money. Trading in your repeat stickers is also pointless since you’re rewarded with the exact same stickers you just traded in. And trading with other players is also pointless since everyone is missing THE EXACT SAME STICKERS. This game could be so much better and so much more fun if it didn’t take thousands of rolls to even compete in the events and get any rewards and if they didn’t gatekeep certain cards. This game is fun up until you reach a certain point and then it’s just annoying. Don’t bother downloading it and getting super invested in it. Oh and if you do waste your time putting in the effort to win an event, it’s a gamble as to whether or not you’re actually gonna receive your awards. And customer service does absolutely nothing to help","Missing rewards, useless sticker packs"
2,2023-09-17 15:11:00,"The game is great until you get up into the higher levels .Me personally, I’m at board 152 at this point you have to invest money into the game to keep building the new card album they came out with gives you way less dice then previous and the odds of getting the card you actually need are so small that the game is literally forcing you to pay out real money as the game lacks a feature to communicate with players on your board or see their boards. Unless fb activated also if you want any chance of winning any of the competitions on this game money, physical money is required and then you ask yourself after you spend all this money. What do you get in return the gratification of what level you’re on the excitement drains quickly after board 70 as the game becomes retentive, they have reduced payouts and the number of dice you can win even increased the max number of stars required to get safes. The is a fast way to loose real money into the guy who knocked someone else’s review grow up yourself",Money Maintenance & Algorithms Not realistic
2,2023-08-29 20:34:29,"When you first start playing the games it’s a blast. You can play for hours with not alot of dice. But as you get to levels round 3k and up the game doesn’t make any since. For example your building upgrades cost billions, you can only get up to 80 rolls, and everything in the shop cost the same with no extra dice for higher levels. The packs should coincide with your level so if you want to buy 100dollars worth of dice at a high level you should get at the minimum 10k dice. 3500 dice for 100 bucks is insanity at higher levels. Same with the 80dice limit. Can’t do anything in the game for free once you get to higher level because the limit for dice stays at 80 when it should be prolly 1-2k to be honest. Also how you can get 6-10 dupes of same gold cards and can’t get the one gold card you are missing is laughable to complete albums. That has to change and soon because that is just wrong. Should either beable to trade gold cards or you shouldn’t be able to get dupes of them.",Game needs to be reconfigured for higher levels
2,2023-08-13 16:03:42,"First off the game is fun and addicting. But that’s the first part. There are constant bugs so don’t even waste your time spending actual money for dice. Since the cake baking contest I’ve sent requests about fixing the issue of people I’ve removed from my friends list being able to still attack me back to back and that should only be able to be done by friends. Then there’s the issue of it crashing during a heist. You win and it crashes and then when you go back in and do the heist again, you don’t get the prize. The new car show contest is way harder than the cake one. Like it’s designed to make you run out of dice so that you have to spend money to get more dice to finish your car. Don’t get me started on the cards. I’m down to my last 3 gold cards needed to finish and out of over 10 pink packs, I keep getting duplicate gold cards of ones Ive had for weeks. Never a new gold card that I need and the pink packs are supposed to be supreme. The game has gone way down and I’d never spend money on this again.",Getting Worse!
5,2023-08-21 18:30:13,"Let me start off by saying I love this game. However, when it comes to collecting stickers, there’s not much room to get new ones. Also, if the gold stickers can’t be traded or used to get the chests, why are we getting extras? I believe the gold ones either need to be used to get a new card of choice (gold and normal) or it needs to be able to be traded.   Rolls need to reload more at a time. I have to wait an hour for 7 rolls when my bar max is 70. If I wait an hour, I want at least half of the bar to be filled back up.   As said in a previous comment, we need a reliable trading system. We need a trade limit and a gift limit. You can gift x amount of stickers but after that you have to make a trade one sticker for another. So no one gets screwed over as I’ve seen many times in the official trading group","Needs some improvement, but super fun"
3,2023-08-13 07:46:19,"I love playing this game as do a lot of people I know. However the frustrating part is trying to finish the album. For example I only need 2 gold cards to finish the whole album like a lot of other people I have talked to in the many Facebook trading groups. We can’t trade gold cards to get the ones we need yet I have so many duplicates of other gold cards. Yes we can save up stars and trade the duplicate gold cards in the vaults, however the time it takes to earn 1500 stars to be able to trade in the purple vault is pointless. I like many others have done this only to receive more duplicate cards. It would be nice if we could be guaranteed to receive a card from said vault that we do not currently have. I know this is possible as I’ve seen the purple and gold card packs that clearly say they guarantee a card you do not have. Come on developers this would be a nice change to the game that would give people more incentive to continue playing!!!!",Suggested improvement
1,2023-11-09 21:30:02,"The game is full of crap. First the one hour wait for 8 dice is ridiculous, second the 8 hour wait for another 10 to 12 is a joke, then there’s these bots that take all your money. If I can’t bank heist random people why are they able to bank heist me and take millions of dollars. Then there’s the duplicate cards. Completing a board is almost impossible because once you build your money up here comes a random person to take your money or you start building your city here come somebody random to knock it down because you don’t have enough money to finish building. I use to love the game, was on here all day but now I just stop by to grab my lil daily rewards, spin a few dice and get off and play something else. Lastly, when you finally finish a board we are given 50 lil dice. Every board finished we should earn more and more dice. But I guess because everybody complaining about the same things nothings gonna change until we all just find something else to play. I’ve reduced to only playing when there’s a partner challenge, that’s the only fun in the game.",Deserve zero stars
3,2023-11-03 04:27:46,I love this game it is so much fun it has become a game amongst my friends and family. Now to the complaints! First off is the amount of stickers you are able to share! Only 5 that’s ridiculous. If I want to share one or two stickers with 2 or 3 friends then I have to tell the rest of my friends that they will have to remind me tomorrow to send others! NOT COOL!  Also while we’re on the subject of stickers what is the deal with getting the same stickers over and over again! I can’t finish some of my albums because I can’t get any new stickers I’m going on 3 weeks of not getting any new stickers even when I have bought packages or traded in stickers for the chests I don’t get any new it’s not even worth trading them in! I’m am on the verge of deleting the game altogether! I know y’all wanna make money but if your not giving new stickers it’s not even worth it! Im gonna give it another week and if things don’t change I’m deleting the app and won’t be back!,Love the game butttt
3,2023-10-18 11:41:04,"I lost my game at my net worth at 3,675. My Facebook somehow when I logged in created a second game and started me from the begging. You can still see my old game but for some reason I can’t access it as monopoly go created a second game at the beginning as a new player connected to my one Facebook. I had to message support 9 times just for them to tell me there is nothing to do. They didn’t offer me any free rolls to help me jump my progress back to where I was. I literally had to hound them into giving me some rolls for my inconvenience as I have spent a few hundred on my old game and felt it was unfair to just tell me there’s nothing by to be done the money you spent was just a literal waste. They literally only gave me 135 rolls as if that really was going to help me progress anywhere in the game. You get more rolls with a 9.99 purchase in the shop. No where near a fair trade for the couple hundred I spent on the game just for it all the be deleted",Pretty Fun but Terrible Customer Service
4,2023-09-30 15:20:36,"Alright, this game is pretty cool. You get to collect money, collect stickers, build landmarks, bank heist, knock down landmarks, collect cool tokens and shields, etc. I play this game every day just trying to keep up my stuff. The only thing i hate are two things. 1. The rolls will run out! They take a while to fill up but when you just keep rolling…its crazy. You start with 2,000 and go down to 5 in just 5 minutes. Lol you just want to try get the challenges done or collect money. I like to build my rolls up but sometimes i get crazy. Now 2. THE STICKERS. Gosh…you collect SO MANY OF THE SAME STICKERS!!!!!!!! when you just need that one sticker or those few stickers to complete a set. It’s almost feels impossible every completing them alll!!!!! Out all this whole game, the stickers frustrate me the most. Plus the facebook group isn’t always helpful..people are stingy with their cards.   Other than that. Its a pretty cool game.",Make you want more
1,2023-07-28 11:07:39,This game is fun at first but once you start getting higher up in the levels the game starts doing you so dirty. I’ve spent so much money on this game and I get soooooo close to milestones just like I am right now and it makes me hit spots that do nothing for me and make me waste all of my dice. This game is about to get deleted off of my phone. I send invites to my friends have people download the game it doesn’t even reward me doesn’t reward me half of the time AT ALL. This game is fun at the very first but of it and then just becomes and headache. OH AND the trading group for cards it has on Facebook is TRASHHHHHHH nobody ever wants to help anyone out. There’s scammers. I’ve done nothing but help others and gift cards and you know what help I’ve gotten? NONE. It’s a game and people are stingy this game cheats everyone who plays in and I will not spend another penny on it because it’s not worth it at all. So many people are about to delete it. About 9.8k people were just talking about it a few days ago. Take it from me. Don’t even waste the energy or space on your phone until this game starts doing people right.,Waste of time
3,2023-08-21 12:42:07,"I like the game. There are a few issues they should change. Gold stickers seem like a pay wall. You should be able to trade them at least once a week. The varying pricing of offers and what you get in them is ridiculous. On my account it has higher prices with less items than my husbands account which is a lower price with more items. The repetition of boards is a bit ridiculous. Why have so many boards of you’re just going to repeat designs? The worst part of the game for me is actually the leveling system. You get free dice from leveling a few times before level 2,000. After that you don’t get more dice from leveling until level 4,000. I am over level 8,000 and have not received more dice from leveling since level 4,000. It takes time to level up so high because the price of building goes up significantly. You should reward your players for that. I do like the game and the concept but a few changes could make me love it.",I like monopoly go
2,2023-07-15 21:14:55,"I’ll start off saying, this app has been great and addicting. Not too much pressure to buy in-app purchases as long as you’re patient. The ONLY not great thing will be the customer service for this game specifically. In-app Customer Support states 24 hour turnaround but that’s false. There continues to be no responses in close to a week. After reaching out to general Scopely customer support, tickets are not read and are just redirected to use in-app specific support even though the ticket states that there hasn’t been a response and your ticket is closed. All around fun app, just really needs a better handle on Customer Support. Game saving via Login with Apple is very broken. Device upgrades will make you lose all progress at this time. After upgrade your game will be logged in as normal but your entire stats are reset and it creates a brand new account. You aren’t even able to log out and try again. When turning off in settings, the game doesn’t check and still has you logged in. Good luck!",Great app but Customer Support is rough
2,2023-09-19 20:49:15,"The game is fun and can quickly become an addiction to play. As you advance it becomes ridiculously expensive to complete a board and more times than not after you’ve worked hard to make the hundreds of millions it takes to be able to complete the board you’ll be robbed of majority of your earnings by a game robot if/when you leave your board unattended for a hours.   The game cycles the same 5-6 friends for you to bank heist and when those same friends heist you their earnings are nothing detrimental to your progress, a couple 100k, to low millions. However, someone that nowhere to be found on your friends list can come and take millions and even BILLIONS from you before you ever had a chance to use it.   I’ve written the customer service team more times than I can count, as soon as I mention this error and provide screenshots, they always close the conversation have yet to get back to me. It makes what was once a very fun and entertaining game very hard to want to play.",Once was fun but now frustrating
5,2023-04-18 11:47:57,"I don’t understand what rolling doubles does. I thought it was supposed to give me another free go but it doesn’t. Also, five rolls every hour is absurd that should be changed to maybe 10 an hour would encourage more app usage. Another thing, stop giving me three pop up offers after I finish my rolls! It’s annoying and it happens every single time even if I get an extra roll from full shields or rolls from jail. There’s also no information to know which building to smash for the most money and why, or why some buildings have already been demolished by other players and what demolishing them again does. Lastly, how does the dice work? Is it not standard probability with 6,7,8 being the most likely and 2,12 being the least likely? It would help a TON knowing if they are completely random or there is some strategy behind the dice.",Doubles??? Rolls???
4,2023-08-19 17:58:43,"This game certainly gets you hooked early on, and I do enjoy playing it however the lack of dice available without having to pay for them (which I think is bizarre) is sad. I know about the 25 free dice you can get daily on instagram, the daily free treat gift on the app, the free gift every 8 hours in the shop and the quick wins each week but the actual rewards from the game play is lame. Dice should accumulate at a faster speed or the quantity of dice accumulating in the hour should be higher.  It seems the only way to get anywhere with the dice rolls is by using the multiplier however since the car show event ended, whenever I use the multiplier it seems that the rolls land me on spots on the board that do not provide any rewards that help me advance in the game.  The sticker album is also a joke. I’m getting the same 1 or 2 star stickers over and over. I’ve got the last 9 albums left to complete and all my real life friends that I trust not to take a sticker without giving a sticker are needing the same ones to complete albums… kind of ironic if you ask me. We are on different levels too.  I’d rather pay & purchase the game once and be able to advance in the game and play consistently without feeling like the only way I will advance will be with an in app purchase than get “deals” for packs of dice and cash that don’t last.",Potential but failing.
3,2023-08-03 17:43:17,"This game is fun, but it teeters into developer greed when they refuse to increase your dice payout when you get to higher levels. They only give you 8 dice an hour, up to 80 dice, which at the multiple availability of 5 can a lot of the time not be enough to even buy one house at a higher level.  The properties are not ratio’d properly to achieve what you need to with the amount of dice you receive. Also, the game hoards stickers and does not give out 5 star stickers in proportion.  I have all of my stickers completed except for gold 5 star stickers.  If it gets to the end of the sticker challenge, and I have not received those gold star stickers (which only the game can provide) I’m done, because what’s the purpose it the game is going to hold you back from necessary resources. (Such as they do with the dice). Sure the game is addicting, but developers can do a better job and evening out the playing field based on levels and the necessary tools to overcome them.",This game is fun BUT…
1,2023-07-05 17:53:20,"This morning (7/5) when this new “cake” challenger was introduced, this app has been glitching out. I spent 50$ this morning to get the promotional pack of dice that included 5000 extra on top of the 1250. Every time I try to log in it’s producing an error or telling me it can’t login via Facebook. I’ve updated and STILL nothing. I have a screen recording as well of this. I also have proof that I was in 1st place for the “Golf” tournament and because I can’t log in, I can’t redeem my reward which was 1500 dice, a pink stick pack, and several million in Monopoly money. If you all want to add new features that’s fine, but it becomes a problem when I’m paying money and can’t access the application at all. At this moment the app will not load past 30%. I’m extremely annoyed and will seek this money back if this isn’t addressed soon.   Update: after “CHATTING” with support now that I can FINALLY access the app, it’s going to take 5 days for them to review my claim for the Gold tournament even after submitting proof via screenshot that I was in first place when the glitching started.",This changes things for me
5,2023-09-18 20:28:39,I used to enjoy playing this game but with the changes that have come about with the new sticker album doesn’t add up. Too many duplicate gold cards that you can’t do anything with. I’m in 3 trade groups plus two with family and we are all looking for the same stickers. I completed 2 number 1 spots in the tournaments and still got duplicate gold stickers. You don’t get enough dice to get what you need without paying for it. This games has turned into a money scheme. I reached out to customer service for dice I won but was taken away each time I rolled and never heard back. The money you win in the heist is less than what’s put into your account. It’s no longer fun anymore and everyone is complaining about the same things. Once I finish donating my stickers I’m uninstalling this game. It’s not fun to play anymore.,No longer fun to play
2,2023-09-14 23:48:16,This game has so much potential but it’s just too frustrating for longevity. Getting 8 rolls an hour just to use them all in 30 seconds is ridiculous. Each time you finish a board you have to spend more and more (monopoly) money to finish the next one but you still only get 50 rolls when you complete. Having to click through four different attempts at getting us to spend real money just to get into the game is annoying. Having 11 duplicates of stickers when you still need over half is lame. Even worse is getting duplicates of gold cards which you can’t trade/gift those anyway. The vaults when you spend stars should automatically give you new ones not 4 of the same stickers you just traded in. All of the dice you win for completing sets has significantly diminished. If I don’t complete all these sticker packs this time around I will honestly probably delete. Which is sad because it’s been fun to play with my friends and even strangers! I hope things change.,Fun but needs improvement
2,2023-05-02 16:10:54,"Hello I am reviewing this as I am super frustrated. I am Inlove with this game and play it religiously with a couple of my friends. However I haven’t received some of the rewards for my Facebook friends who joined and when I reached out to customer service I was told that someone would get back to me within 24 hours. That was WEDNESDAY of last week and today is Tuesday. So almost a WEEK and still no communication. I have messaged customer  service SEVERAL times and still no response. Very very unprofessional to say that I’ll be contacted within 24 hours and it’s been a week. Update your system to let people know that it’s going to be weeks before you get back to them. I am ready to quit playing over the fact that customer service can’t respond in a timely manner that was stated to me.   It’s unfortunate, as I said above this game is so much fun and I really enjoy playing it with friends. However, when I’m don’t receive what I should be given, it’s discouraging and makes me not want to continue playing.",Customer service issues.
2,2023-09-19 21:27:24,"I’m at the point in the game now that it costs me $200 Billion to complete a board and even with a few thousand dice it’s hard to level up. And now with this new album having one gold sticker in every set and the dice prizes for finishing sets being cut in half it just isn’t fun anymore. I save money up to upgrade my boards during wheel boosts and somehow I end up going down to 0 an hour or so before the wheel boost starts. Just the other day I had $600 Billion when I went to bed and I woke up with absolutely nothing because one person who isn’t even on my friend’s list stole every penny from me, but people who are on my friends list have only ever stole $1 Billion at the very most and that was during a mega heist. Once you get to higher levels you can’t do anything unless you have thousands of dice and even when you do have thousands of dice you can’t do anything because all of your money disappears before you get a chance to spend it. And customer service is a complete joke","Not bad, but needs work"
4,2023-08-01 02:21:28,"So I got this app last night and have been playing a lot. Basically its nothing like the original board game, you just roll and roll on this board and earn money to build landmarks in different cities, once you level up all of the landmarks you move to a different place. You can shut down their landmarks and complete bank heists too.   You can also connect your contacts to the app to add everyone in your contact list that has downloaded the game and connected their phone number. But I have no idea how to even add other people on the app.   I also got this app after I had watched an ad on another game (I have so many 💀) and it showed the game like it was the actual board game and I was so excited. I was disappointed that you cannot play the actual monopoly game live with your friends on this app. Instead, you have to purchase the Monopoly app for five dollars. Its not expensive but im still disappointed that on an ad it showed it as a live match and in return i have an app thats nothing like the old board game I love.   If you are thinking of getting this app, just know that you dont play any actual games and its not really like the game. Just purchase the other monopoly app that is truly the monopoly game we know and love.

3,2023-09-08 14:42:35,"So for context I’m almost level 6,000 which takes a pretty good while to get to so I’ve been playing this game for quite some time. It’s pretty addicting and enjoyable. However you get to a point where unless you want to keep climbing, you’re going to spend money. Yes you can play the game without spending money of course, until you get to a point where the rewards don’t scale well with your level, everything gets expensive, and the 80 rolls you get every like ten hours feels worthless. Once your dice refill after a long time, you hop on, roll them in a matter of seconds, and then you’re left with nothing else to do. They also have have daily competitions with rewards and you climb by landing on certain tiles, but let me tell you, if you aren’t spending on the game, then you’re not placing anywhere in the top 20’s of that tourney. Hope to see some changes in the future with dice scaling accordingly to your level.",Fun for a while but then

My complaints are there are way too many glitches and I’ve even paid for dice packs and have not received them. I’ve complained to Apple, they denied each and every one of my complaints. No refunds at all. Complained to Scopely, no refund. Every time you complete a board, you only receive 50 dice after spending millions of dollars. 8 dice an hour is a joke. Completing any challenge is a joke. The card packs gives duplicates of all cards, especially the gold cards that you can’t do anything with. Buying dice and card packs are way too expensive.

5,2023-08-10 13:43:00,So I’m really not big on playing games on my phone. I decided to find a game or two when I got my new phone so I chose this one because it was popular. I LOVE it. I got my mom playing too and we have a lot of fun. I was hesitant at first because the board game of Monopoly is pretty boring and slow.. but this is nothing like the board game. I highly recommend to just try it out! No ad breaks where you have to watch that lady go homeless and freeze to death with her child (so annoying no longer funny as those ads have been playing for years and years now).. try this game out. You don’t have to spend any money to get fair gameplay. Some games you have to spend money just to get a fair chance but not here. If you don’t like the game just delete it. I recommended playing the game with at least one person you know tho.,LOVE THIS APP
2,2023-10-10 02:57:49,"I’m not sure why we are forced to play monopoly with millions of people at the same time.  I thought this game was limited to your Facebook friends list but apparently not.  Big waste of an opportunity, people are constantly playing this game; cheating,  no matter the time of day it could be four am and here comes 80 attacks on your landmark often from the same person ironically not on your friends list and have no idea who they are.  There’s also no chat function so it’s like there’s no way to ask who these people are.  I do not want to play monopoly with half of the world at the same time.  Since I joined I have counted more than 643 people who aren’t on my friends list on my board.  I stopped playing for months cuz it was just that annoying.  This game probably won’t be around much longer, they’re more interested in monies than fixing anything.

3,2023-09-27 16:07:23,"After playing for a while, I’ve notice in order to be able to achieve rewards/tournaments you are left with minimum options as a player who doesn’t want to buy dice. The rewards have dwindled to lower amounts of dice.  Rent frenzy, money, extra dice count have taken the place of rewards; cutting out the dice you would have received a month ago. I find this update useless, money as a reward is silly. Money will be aquired no matter what with dice rolls. The stickers are nothing but duplicates and rarely something you need. The whole quality of the game has gone down with little incentives to keep playing and more pressure to buy dice to play. Went from maintaining a large amount of dice in the thousands to struggling to keep dice in the low hundreds. After the update, everything changed. Found myself playing less because the rewards do not replinsh the dice used to get them, barely giving back anything to the player.",Pay to play game

There’s a lot of places that are really fun in this monopoly game and plus you get to battle people really fun you get to see people that you know you to make friends and less you get to steal peoples diamonds.

Are you getting up with her family or friends and yeah but anyways, if you’re reading this, yeah I downloaded it because it’s so fun and maybe you will get to be with me",So amazing
1,2023-07-27 01:50:27,"This game has great potential but you guys really need to figured out some of the kinks. For one, there's been multiple times that the dice say one thing but my token does not move that many. Secondly, more dice rolls need to be offered and cash for board completion. At least have the rewards grow as you move up every few boards. Next the cards are ridiculous. I should not be getting multiple duplicates especially the golden cards (which can’t be traded) and not receive any new cards for weeks. There should be at least once a month or something we can trade golden cards.  You have people out here SELLING 5 star cards and less for actual $$$ that is absolutely crazy. The game also has no way of communicating with your in game friends for trading. Not everyone is linked or wants to go through facebook when there are tons of scammers. Lastly the glitches in the game are ridiculous and I lost 100’s if dice which were in my rolls due to a glitch making my app malfunction. Please fix these issues and I promise you'll have a ton of happier players.",Frustrating but Love it

4,2023-05-28 01:29:18,"The game overall is good and has very good mechanics, however if the game is going to push the facebook group on you then there needs to be a feature that holds people accountable in game. For say a trade to happen both players should have to lock in there cards before the trade is accepted because in the facebook group chat there are countless scammers making new accounts daily to scam stars. It is so easy to do this and makes the game frustrating when you think someone is going to give you a card for either stars or your card and then they block you steal the card and it’s over for you. No way to get it back or report that player because it’s in the name of “gifting” this system is messed up and allows this. There needs to be two separate things a gift button and a trade button allowing players who aren’t scummy to trade with players to complete sets.",Gifting/ “Trading”
1,2023-05-09 04:11:23,"This isn’t actually Monopoly this is basically just Dice Dreams/Piggy Boom but a lot less challenging. It doesn’t feel like there’s much of a point or challenge to this game. And honestly it felt like I was battling with the same 5 people/possible bots over and over which again makes this kind of game pointless. For games like this to work actual people need to play with you which means adding a global/multiplayer mode if there isn’t already one would strongly benefit this game as you would have actual players playing it instead of bots. Seriously, people hardly use Facebook anymore (most games dropped having to connect to Facebook for a reason, just saying..) and that shouldn’t be the only way to get more players to play with you. Adding a global/multiplayer mode would at least make this game feel challenging because there will be actual competition to battle, not just the same 5 people who are more than likely bots anyway. So that’s my thoughts on this, the game isn’t for me but I may revisit it if a global mode is added.",Pointless without a global/multiplayer mode
1,2023-09-07 22:14:19,"This game was ok at first, a good way to pass time and connect with others. Then I think scopely got money hungry or something. They completely changed the game to make it to where you absolutely have to purchase in order to win anything at all. I made a few purchases, was double charged on one of them for $106. I have contacted support numerous times and they absolutely refuse to help at all. Most of the time they dont even respond at all. So today I started looking through my billing to dispute the charge and realized that I have been double charged on several occasions. This is absolutely unacceptable. DO NOT HOOK ANY CREDIT, DEBIT, OR BANK INFORMATION TO THIS APP. They will rip you off, then not respond at all. I had to screenshot everything over and over just to prove to them that their game is glitching and ripping people off constantly. Then they will respond like “oh we are aware of the multiple glitches and purchase issues, we are sorry, instead of refunding you or giving you your actual rewards here is 25 dice”.

1,2023-06-18 16:25:02,"I was honestly pretty confused when I first played this game, I had gone through about fifty rolls and I didn't see the point. You don't get to make strategic choices or get rewarded for any skillful actions, it's just roll the dice and do one of the three different things that can happen. Your input in the game is nothing more than pressing a single button until you run out of dice and you can be encouraged to pay for more. The absolute most you can do is when you land on a train station. you can either get a “shutdown” where you get to tap on another players building and get money, or a heist where you just tap on some vaults and get money, only for you to go back to your board and press your one button until something mildly interesting happens. The only sense of progression in the game is building your own small city of five buildings which you pay to upgrade so that you can eventually do it again in a new area. Your choice to n what building you upgrade has no effect just like practically everything else you'll find in this game.",Zero gameplay

2,2023-10-20 01:08:01,"The algorithm is flawed. You get way too many duplicate cards for the amount of money you have to spend to actually enjoy the game. If you earn free rolls, you will land on the jail tile more time than not. I was unfairly targeted on the trading cards Facebook. Even though, I always traded fairly and I never scammed anyone. It started when one of the admin or moderators blocked my responses to trade requests. I screenshot and posted it. Then, out of the blue, as soon as I logged in at 11:30 at night for the first time that day, and tried to respond to a trade request, I was blocked for 24 hrs. It was the night before the gold cards dropped so I was blocked from posting for the entire day. Things like that make me HATE the game. On top of that out was virtually impossible to reach customer support. None of my chat requests were ever acknowledged which makes it easier for the online folks to do annoying things like block me for no reason. However the graphics are super cool and it is overall enjoyable.",Unbiased Opinion
1,2023-09-28 19:00:45,"I enjoyed this game at first but now it’s terrible. The new sticker pack is absolutely ridiculous. The amount of repeats I’ve been getting is insane. Barely any gold stickers (even 1 star stickers), and still no four, five, or six star stickers.  This one person that I blocked on Facebook YEARS AGO has been able to repeatedly attack my board, but I can only attack him as revenge. How was he even able to come across me in the game in the first place since I have him blocked on Facebook?  80 rolls is simply not enough to make any real progress in the game. It’s also laughable that you only receive 50 rolls when you complete a board. Especially when you get to boards 100+  The amount of times the “special” deals pop up is absurd. At least 4-6 pop up as soon as you open the app then they come up again when you run out of rolls. It’s ad overload.  The game won’t even load today so all of my landmarks are destroyed and all of my money is gone. No telling when I’ll be able to get back on. Today might be the day I delete it.","Fun at first…now, not so much"
1,2023-09-11 07:14:30,"This game is broken. This sticker season is horrible and will be the cause of a significant drop off in the number of people that play this game.

The moment the daily tournament is over, I immediately begin to get bank heist abundantly now that I missed out on the cakes. I don’t like being cheated and everything is different right now. I’m attempting to finish the last cakes for for friends but definitely deleting this game after this event. We use to get 100 dice or every fb friend that joined. I know people that still receive it and I’ve had at least 30 friend to join since I stopped receiving the reward.

Since they were no a friend on my side, I was not able to target them back or remove them.  This incident forced me to change my strategy. To keep this person from shutting down my landmarks, I decided not to upgrade my landmarks until I had enough money to complete the board. This worked marvelously for a little while until someone else who is not a friend on my side had a bank heist against me and stole almost everything I had saved up. $921  million in one bank heist. In addition to this, when I had a friend over playing the game at the same time as me, they had a bank heist against me and stole $56k, but when I got the notification of their bank heist, it said they stole $11 million.",Scam
3,2023-07-14 19:08:54,"I find this game, highly addicting to play, it’s a wonderful game when you have nothing to do in your day the features you guys have on here are decent. My only issue is and I know there’s others who probably have the same issue and that is she would be the stickers situation… I understand you have to get nine stickers per album to complete the album, but do you know how hard it is to get those stickers??? well, of course you do ya made it,,, but honestly once you get to a point in the game with the stickers your stuck,,, and what I mean by that is for the past two months every sticker that I have been receiving our stickers that I’ve already got, it’s extremely hard and rare for us to get “new stickers“,,,,, Ya need to update the game for the stickers, I feel like the higher the map you get on the better of chances you have to get stickers you actually need and not doubles, I’m on map 70 n I’m getting nothing in my stickers",UPDATE THE STICKERS

Absolute board manipulation going on as well. You will land on the four corners over and over and over and then once the tournament or event is for the four corners it will be like pulling teeth. Waaaaayyyy more duplicate stickers and require 1000 more stars to acquire the big vault. Man there’s so much I could go on about but the kicker is this.  The game was down for 12 hours today. For technical difficulties and every single player being locked out of the game, bots destroying landmarks and taking over positions in the tournament we got a measly 200 dice, and sticker packs full of nothing but duplicates. For a game that made millions over night it sure is crazy how much you don’t mind screwing over the players that earned you that money.

The dice do not increase with the levels. The dice only load by the hour. If you want someone to play, load the dice in 15-30 min increments. If you switch targets, you keep getting the same suggested target until you attempt a shutdown. Support always asks for pictures but if the game is progressing forward, how are you supposed to provide a picture. Who memorized their game ID?! Landing only on corners for rewards is insane because then you never land on corners once that is the requirement. Landing on utilities for rewards is insane because then you never land on utilities once that is the requirement. The tournaments are really stupid because you can’t swap out a partner who maybe quit playing. Additionally, the spins for the point value do not make sense either.

There is no reason why you only get 8 dice per hour.  Why can’t I buy dice with in game money.  I get so much in game money with is almost pointless.  You only get 50 dice when you finish a board.  You should get the same amount of dice as the level of the board you finish…finish board 105, you get 105 dice. Top 2 spots in events should get a guaranteed new card. Heck too 3 really should.  Can never get 1st place because the people sending 100s or 1000s of dollars always have that spot.  A good equality game can players can get the good stuff with skill, not with real money.

It just says that on my screen, (iPhone 12) let me tell you a story, so my friend and I, we’re playing together, and I got a mega heist on he/she and I got the three gold bars with a times 50 and it said that they went bankrupt but then I told them and then they said they didn’t, but overall great game!",Good game!

We should be able to get another gold card that we already have if we can’t trade it. Than the rewards for completing a board your dice prize doesn’t go up which I feel it should increase. The money prize goes up but the dice prize has always been 50 dice which is ridiculous especially since what really makes the game function is the dice. One time I got frozen in a shut down during a challenge and was unable to complete the challenge because of it and missed out on a lot of prizes, including dice. Last sticker sets we got bigger prizes for the completing sets and now they have decreased it and made it harder to complete sets. This game is so frustrating.",Scam
2,2023-08-11 13:46:53,"This game was fun for a while, but after you hit a certain “Net Worth” the game completely changes. The “Tile Events” and “Tournaments” become harder to obtain. You either roll between 1-2 numbers higher or lower from the tile you actually need to land on. You’ll go through some many dice, before even landing on the “said” tile. When I’m real life you probably would of landed on it a few time. I feel like they change the probability on the dice for  the “Tile Events” and “Tournaments”  When it’s a “Tile Event” and you need to land on the 1 of the 4 corners. You’ll barely land on the corners, but when the “Tile Event” changes. Now you need to land on “Community Chest”. You’ll notice you start landing on 1 of the 4 corners and not the “Community Chest” as much. The event dictates the probability of the rolls. When is shouldn’t be that way.

It makes me feel bullied and not want to play this game anymore because of it. I don’t know if the monopoly support team would even see this but if they do, i wish they would make a block/report button because a removal button just isn’t working.

Second is the stickers in the current sticker season I have now unlocked the last lockbox for extra stickers (2,500 EXTRA STICKERS) and i still have not gotten a new sticker, one star, four star, golds etc since maybe the third or fourth week of the EPIC MYTHS sticker season I understand that it should be difficult to complete every set and you want players yo trade with others but it gets ridiculous when no one is getting a new sticker for months it seems",Ad Pop Ups and stickers

CUSTOMER SUPPORT is non existent, I lost my account a few days ago and trying to get it back is such a hassle.

The packs were hard to complete, but possible and the rewards were worth the work put in. Now, the rewards are significantly less and the odds are near impossible to complete sets so it all feels a little pointless. I honestly would spend 2.99 or whatever here and there for rolls before this update but now even those prices went up and you get less rolls. Not only that but the odds of landing on anything worth while is even less now. I’ll go through half my dice before I even land on anything.

3,2023-10-15 21:23:31,Y’all are taking the fun out of the game!!! I’m at board 187  so I’ve had a lot of time to critique.  What’s the point of giving us the same duplicates over and over again especially for the gold cards when they are so hard to come by ??? Another issue I have is why is the game so expensive??? $10 plus tax for $180 dice ? What do u expect us to do with 180 dice ??? If we’re gonna put money on the game atleast give us packs with a decent value where we will have enough dice to reach somewhere in competitions. Another thing is why when we complete boards we keep getting 50 dice? I think the further we get in the game the more dice we should receive after board completion especially because the boards gets way more expensive and harder to complete hence we should receive higher rewards.   If nothing changes I’ll definitely be deleting because I’m getting really frustrated with this game !!,Too expensive
3,2023-06-03 13:04:46,"When you first start it’s really enjoyable to play. However, after a certain level, it makes no sense to roll less than a 20 multiplier because it will take FOREVER to level up. Dice take way to long to build up and to find, and again, the limited amount you can build up to hamper rolling anything higher than a 5 multiplier.  When you spin the wheel, the multiplier should be applied here as well. You should get more dice/money for every board level you go up. Dice should be applied when your net worth goes up. Why can’t we trade gold cards?!? This is dumb. Everyone I know only needs gold cards to complete sets but we can’t trade these among ourselves.  The shop options are way to expensive for the little amount of dice you get. $5.00 for only 80 dice?!? Come on. Like I said, after around level 20, rolling less that a 20 multiplier doesn’t make sense, so for $5.00 you only getting 4 rolls!!  🫤",Great start but gets frustrating

You can not contact any players on your team to get help or help them.

The engineer team is definitely working on overdrive here, as well as support and PR , which I have to appreciate. However, as someone in tech, this game should have never been marketed heavily / introduced to the App Store before all kinks were fixed.  It’s very clear that the sheer number of players has overwhelmed their server and there team which has led to COUNTLESS bugs/glitches/issues. Now every app has these, but there’s so many, that once something is fixed, they must have an array of others to fix. My game is consistently glitched and fixes don’t come for days. This will continue to be a complete snowball effect for the app and truly don’t think there will ever be a solution unless the game / app is completely revised from the ground up.   Additionally, while I understand it’s a money trap, like a lot of apps…. People have become hooked on this game, and recently it’s been very clear that the creators are prying to make more money off of their users in hopes (from what I can think) is to make enough money to hire more or better back end engineers to make the game better, but in turn is making it UNBEARABLE for people who don’t want to spend money to even want to play for the last 3-4 days.

So first what I saw was that when like I stole money from the bank and they owed me money literally there was a man and women they were both naked I could literally see the woman’s breasts the man was kissing the women’s breast and shoulder he even licked her booty and her under part too they where on a bed lying down together the women was moaning inappropriately and their name was SEX PLACE like obs witch means obviously that was whey they looked like they where really sexing and second of all that was a facebook account so you guys can’t allow this cause then maybe people will start doing INAPPROPRIATE THINGS 📢 listen up kids I suggest that you show this to your parents before you even download this app like I’m going to delete this app because of what I saw like the time is 4:17 today and it is Sunday October 8 like obs . ❗️⚠️💯 this is 100 PERCENT TRUE about what I was saying and if you don’t believe me then see it for yourself like I saw that at level 63 read this parents children and teen.,Inappropriate picture for account.
5,2023-09-10 14:29:14,Alright I’ll be honest the game it’s addictive but the rolls goes out so fast then I don’t even know that if half the players are actually real players and not bots another thing I feel like only you friends and family should be actually to knock your builds down or do the bank heist every single time I grind to save up money soon as I load it Im back at 100K after I spent all night grinding get to 200 or 300 mil it’s worthless that you have to actually worry about other people who don’t even know attack you well no anybody that is a real player can attack your builds but when it comes down to bank heist only friends and family it’s not fair I can only do bank on heist on friends but these people I never seen or heard of can just rob me blind,Fix the game to actually make it better for the new players
1,2023-09-23 10:39:14,"This game is definitely set up like real life!   We buy the packs that says guaranteed missing sticker and guess what you don’t get it you get a duplicate of one you already have. You only get 8 dice a hour and that’s dandy for a low level as it stands with me I’m such a high level it cost billions to build so it’s impossible to come out ahead between the attacks and heist from bots. Yes this game is such a scam they can’t leave it to players robbing each other they need to add bots to try to force your hand to spend money on dice that’s ridiculous prices! I play 1 x a day where I was spending literally all day on it. So I’m glad with this latest sticker pack and update I’ve realized the lies they say of fixing the issues is total lies. It’s worse I’ve gotten more duplicated gold cards than I did the last time. Oh I also got 1 monopoly buck when the game was down a whole day, I also didn’t get credit for packs I purchased yet customer service thought 25 dice was it?

2,2023-09-23 08:48:53,"I played this game for about a week. I have to admit that it was fun at first. However there are so many frustrating things about it. First, you can’t even get into the game without X’ing out of 4 or 5 ads every single time. So annoying. Next, the wait 8 hours thing for more rolls is ridiculous along with the few rolls you get every hour. This doesn’t seem equitable with the level. The whole waiting thing was just a downer. Then, I would get up every morning only to find out my properties were attacked or all my money was heisted overnight! I never felt like I could get anywhere because as I advanced, everything became so expensive and I couldn’t gain any ground. The game overall seemed to be very cut throat and that’s not the kind of game I thought it would be and I just ended up deleting the app and requesting my account to be deleted. Games aren’t supposed to be frustrating and there are too many less frustrating games out there to invest time in this one.",Fun at first
2,2023-08-30 19:56:17,"This game is SO MUCH FUN. But, unfortunately, that’s part of the problem. Starting out you’re just playing willy nilly and it’s all sunshine and rainbows. But if you want to do more than just mindlessly roll dice until you run out, over and over again, it becomes a different game.  Trying to progress in events, especially the sticker events, is practically impossible unless you 1) have tens of thousands of dice or 2) pay real money. This game is another gacha system that gets you addicted early and quick. It then tries to steer you into buying all kinds of stuff by making it hard to complete goals/events without doing so.  If the developers would back off the cash-grab tactics and make the gameplay and reward system more balanced, this would be one of the best free mobile games of all time. But, considering they made $135 million in 4 months off people who give in and make these in-app purchases, I don’t see that happening. Unfortunate but also capitalism.",Starts out fun but then…
5,2023-09-27 17:02:51,"Listen, I started this game a while ago because I loved the monopoly board game as a kid. I found it to be fun and kept playing. Recently Scopely has made so many changes in the game.   I WOULDN’T RECOMMEND!!   The game has made it harder to get dice, complete sets, compete in tournaments, get through milestones, receive stickers you actually need, use extras to open vaults, and so much more!  They have become very greedy. It has become all about them making money instead of their players and actually allowing us to play the game without having to spend tons on money. In addition, as you level up and buy bundles (if you choose to do so) they bundles get more expensive each time after making a purchase. My bundles start between $70-$85. The dice within the bundle goes way too quickly for how much is spent. I literally cannot even afford to play this game anymore and get no where with the 80 dice the game gives that takes 10 hours to get (receive 8 dice per hour).   Everything earned in the game is taken away over night by their cute little bots implemented in the game. How fun, right?!   I would’ve recommended this game months ago. Now, I’d tell you it’s not even worth it and to find something better to play.",Wouldn’t recommend
3,2023-08-29 00:14:42,"This game definitely deserves 5 stars, but there are a few things it needs done. Increase the dice limit, and reduce the timer. And make a better trading platform. Why not make it to where you can enter an agreement through the game to trade from 1-5 cards, and you could request specific cards, and one both parties view and accept the terms, they submit the cards and the trade goes through simultaneously. Like you click their profile and click to request a trade. Then you click the cards you want and wait for them to request what they want. At this point you’ve probably been talking to them through comments or messenger about what you both have and need. Once they submit their request, you view it and either accept, or decline. And you wait for them to accept or decline. But the trade doesn’t go through without both parties accepting the trade, and no one gets scammed.",It’s Worth Five Stars If Fixed
5,2023-09-12 18:30:17,"This is the most addicting game (in a good way) that I’ve ever played. I normally get a new game app and delete it after 2 weeks. NOT THIS ONE! It has a death grip on me and I’ll never delete it. When I first downloaded it I thought it would have been just like the board game. Honestly it’s far from it but it’s still so amazing. I love trading stickers, the partner tournaments, and the whole 9 yards. HOWEVER, please make the gold cards tradable for the last 24 hours of the album OR don’t give us duplicates of them at all! It drives me nuts to have all these extra stickers I CAN’T trade. AND give us more dice rolls per hour. It’s driving me nuts! I don’t have anything to do at work but play monopoly go! and I would love to NOT run out of dice as easy. Anyway over all great game just those couple suggestions!! Thank you!",Sticker problems
5,2023-11-02 14:13:04,"Love the game! A couple of suggestions would be to scale up the rewards for completing boards. Boards are costing more to complete but the rewards remain the same. Also we have a private group of twenty or so that play and trade stickers via text messages. It would be nice to have the ability to trade stickers or communicate with other players in the game. Speaking of stickers, no one in our group has been able to collect all 189 stickers, even with trade. There are stickers that are just not being put out by the game. Also, you should be able to purchase the spins to play the partner games. I would also like to echo complaints about the pop ups. They are annoying. I’ve purchased die rolls but I’ve never been influenced to click one of the pop ups.",Scale up the rewards!
4,2023-10-28 23:04:35,"I love this game!  The game itself is so much fun, but it is also one of the stingiest I’ve ever played.  I know these games exist to make money but this one is awful.  Way too much money for way few dice.  And the sticker thing is a joke.  They are worthless.  You always get ones you already have.  They encourage trading but if your an introvert, forget it.  My close friends and I tried to trade but we all have the same ones and need the same ones.  I’ve been playing for quite a long while and never have even seen an offer for a fancy shield until yesterday but it was the top 7 winners in a contest with everybody.  No way to win one without paying your life savings to get that high up on the winners circle.  People just can’t afford this game these days.  It needs to give way more benefits for the prices they charge.",Addicting & Fun but too expensive!
1,2023-08-24 03:47:19,This game is very addictive but like others have said it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get stickers you need in the later on sets especially the golds since they can’t be traded. After you run out of rewards from those sets it’s impossible to win any of the challenges since you don’t have any dice. I have three stickers left and they are all gold. I have been stuck for weeks trying to get these and even after spending a ridiculous amount of money on the game I just continue to get so many duplicates including golds I already have. And even when I get packs including blue/pink/purple they are all duplicates. The vault is also a joke if you are going to trade 1500 to open it you should at least get a 5 star or gold sticker you actually need.  Also you would think the higher you level up the more dice you should get. getting 50 every time is nothing and don’t even get me started on 8 dice an hour.  Honestly don’t know how people have even completed the album if you are stuck on golds. I have had no luck my my sister that just started playing already has the golds from sets20-21 that I am missing and have been trying to get for forever   everyone sell stickers or trying to trade is just ridiculous especially with the amount of scams  I also see everyone posting about the offers that you can buy and for some reason mine always cost more than theirs. That deal that promises a missing sticker my sisters offer was $29 while mine is 59,Disappointed
3,2023-07-10 14:17:00,I got 4 partners but still couldn’t complete the last part of the event cause one of them did nothing. I tried my hardest to complete there part putting in almost 40k points but i lost out on the grand prize of the event because one partner couldn’t pull their weight if i could have dropped that partner and switched i could have gotten the 5k dice rolls i was trying to get but instead i just used 1500 dice trying to complete it myself and now im out of dice having to wait for more which is literally the first time since playing. I feel i got screwed and i had no way to fix it. The partner that didn’t pull their weight was one of the highest on my leader board and is constantly playing to because they were stealing and collecting rent so they just were not doing anything to help our event. This game needs to either stop with the parter events or add a way to drop a partner who isnt doing anything.,Only issue is the partner events
5,2023-08-27 18:26:33,I’ve been playing this addictive game since June. I’ve actually spent real money playing. This is my problem. When I purchased I reached out to customer service because the money was taken and I ever received the rewards. Never got a response. Then it happened again. So the second time it happened I wasn’t expecting a response and immediately requested a refund from Apple at the same time. Don’t know if they saw that but they actually responded the second time. Still have not received a response for the first one and I’ve reached out to them several times to no avail. As much money as they are making I’m sure they could care less about the money I’m spending or am willing to spend. I’m just trying to understand why pick and choose who to respond to.,Frustration
3,2023-11-01 17:17:46,"This shouldn’t be a surprise considering the environment games and entertainment are heading, but this is a carbon copy of games like Coin Master and others but with a Monopoly themed facelift. Spin the wheel (roll the dice), build your village (tycoon), collect cards (stickers), attack other players and take their money, yadda yadda. It’s repetitive downloading different games while getting the exact same experience. Currently there’s also an issue where no matter what I do the game will not allow me to play. I roll, build, do anything, then the game pops up an error message and restarts while wiping any builds or earnings I get. Oh, and there’s a flaw in the gameplay as well. When you land on “Go To Jail” in Monopoly, it’s supposed to send you to jail without passing go, whereas in this game it just keeps you in the “Go To Jail” box while you roll dice to possibly make bail and earn extra dice, making the actual jail space useless.",Not special

On top of that if you are buying for packs you get nothing but duplicates for your money. How is it 2.5 million people in that group and everyone needs the same cards or to finish the same sets. Please update this, make gold cards tradable, add a extra pack besides the purple because that gives us nothing. Maybe a gold pack that gives us at least 2 new cards.

But I love that you can share cards. I hope they can let us share dice. That would be really cool, and it would help with people that want to play with their family and they don’t have to wait for dice. Or we can invite friends to our board and let them play with us and we can share dice. I would really love that.

Another thing that would make the game more enticing; allow us to go to our friends boards just to view. Hear me out I’m in the military and I have gotten a lot of my friends who I’m no longer stationed with into this game with me it would be cool to be able to look on their boards and see the progress their making on building their cars, or cakes (the events you’ve had previously) screen shot it and text them the screenshot asking why they are abandoning our cake/car etc. Makes the game more engaging and would subsequently increase the amount time people spend on the app. Just an idea.

Get several duplicates of gold stars that can’t be traded.  Give more dice and maybe people wouldn’t have been creating their own.  I’m all about fair play, but with your price packages and the very small about of dice you get, there’s no way to continue the game.  You complete first board…you get 50 dice. You complete boards all the way up through 359 where I am now and still get just 50 dice.  You increased everything except the number of dice we get.  It now cost me over 25M to get out of jail, and about 100B to complete a board.  This game must be run by the government.  Dice are our wages and don’t increase while everything else does.

1,2023-09-14 11:38:12,"In the beginning I definitely enjoyed this game. It’s fun and can be addictive. I’ve gotten over 10 people to actually starting playing because I genuinely loved this game.  I typically never purchase anything in apps - especially in games. But I’ve spent well over $200, which for me is INSANE. I understand that yes, it was my decision to purchase things within the game. But for how much I’ve spent I do expect more. Yesterday I wrote to MonopolyGO with my feedback. This morning I wake up and I’m missing 7 billion  dollars and dice in the game. Retaliation? Not sure, but feels more like it was on purpose. If you download this game, just expect to love it and eventually disappointed. If my concerns go unaddressed again I will definitely uninstall and inform my friends of issues and they more than likely will uninstall because I NEVER make reviews. So for me to actually leave a negative review and be a “Karen”, that takes a lot from me. Especially because I work in the world of 5star customer service.

2,2023-08-03 15:38:32,"The game has potential but has A LOT to work on. Early game is fun but the longer you go on the amount of dice and money does not keep up with how much everything costs leaving the game to be frustrating and not very playable.  The stickers are also a fun challenge but duplicate gold stickers without the ability to trade them is asinine. Either let them be traded or don’t give constant duplicates of the same 4 gold cards. I understand not being able to trade 5 of them a day but if we could trade 1 gold card OR 5 normal that would be good. Or even just 1 gold card a week. The amount of pop ups is ridiculous for a game that is making a ton of money. This is a micro transaction heavy game and you will be reminded of that, every single time you run out of dice with 4-5 pop ups to buy dice. It’s even more annoying that you get those pop ups while you still have dice that are just a smaller amount than your multiplier. It takes FOREVER to get dice and even then you don’t get much to actually play to the extent you want.  Wheel spins don’t match your roll amount so when you’re rolling 20+ dice and you win 5 dice it does nothing for you. Completing boards and getting 50 dice won’t even give you the full amount of rolls you can have later in the game. Those also need to grow with you.

I’ve never had the option to do a bank heist with a random player, nor have I’ve been given the option to steal the large amounts of money I’ve been hit for.

1,2023-10-09 18:56:25,Talk about cash grab-This game is fun until you get high up on the board and the price gets so high to build landmarks it takes forever to finish a board. It takes 8 hours to build up free dice and then you can only build to a maximum of 80 dice if you’re far enough on the board. And that takes 10 hours. The other free stuff never changes and the sticker packages are also just repeats. Don’t see how anyone would ever finish the sticker albums by the deadline. They aren’t going to give you a sticker you need until you spend a fortune on dice and you might get one. Although the landmarks get ridiculous to build to move up you still just get 50 measly dice when you complete a board plus the boards are repeat boards you’ve already built before earlier in the game. It is a cash grab game for the makers as much as they charge for dice packages.

For example, there is a toy tournament where you buddy with someone to finish a toy. Well you need to spin a while to determine how much it will work on the toy and I have never received such a high amount before.

Today I opened the chest and landed on the 50 icon and then glitched and said i had no service when I in fact had service and when I went back in did not give me what I originally landed on. To say I’ve reached out and no responses since last week on my issues is saddening especially when the game has stolen money from me.",Issues
5,2023-07-25 11:09:14,"I think this game is one of the best games out of the market, I find myself playing it every night after work, I’ve been playing this game for a good while now and there’s one thing that stands out to me as an idea that may make everyone a little more happy in terms of obtaining stickers, making a window every now and again (like 6 to 12 hours) where you can trade gold stickers, and maybe making it a little easier to obtain the stickers you need, maybe a system where you spend stars from stickers you have gotten to buy a card you need, I play this game every day and grind it but it still seems like I’m not going to be able to get my stickers in time before the event is over and I’m a little disappointed, still a great game overall",Great game (few suggestions)
5,2023-11-03 18:38:18,Monopoly go has benefited me in so many ways that I can’t even describe it my life ever since I started playing Monopoly go has expanded drastically. I’ve improved friendships and created more bonds that I ever had before. My high school experience wasn’t great until I started playing Monopoly go and I owe everything I have monopoly go do you know ever since I started going? People started hanging out with me talking to me inviting me to places that I’ve never been and you know I really didn’t have that opportunity until I downloaded this app and I thought it was stupid everybody talking about monopoly go this and monopoly go that but all I wanted to do was to go out with people and I believe go gave me that opportunity so thank you monopoly go and I hope this game thrives,I owe this game everything
4,2023-07-22 16:07:05,"The game is fun. I don’t like the way you have to add your fb or your phone contacts to get friends. I added my Facebook but not my phone contacts so I’m still unable to do certain things. A lot of people play so it’s fun interacting with them. I’m still currently trying to add friends without releasing all my information. Every since I downloaded this game I have received tons of weird, emails, text, and calls. So this lets me know that it is not safe to add my phone contacts and they are selling your information. Beware of the calls, text, and or emails I believe that it is a scam. I wouldn’t Recommend adding your payment information to this game for safety reasons. Besides that it’s a lot to do I’m still learning it but I can see it has the potential  to be very fun! Change the way we add friends and stop all the spam calls and text!!",Newbie
2,2023-07-10 22:41:32,"Not sure if this has happening to anyone else but here’s my issue. I opened the game this morning and it said I had to download the new update to play, so I did, got on the game and it started to update my cakes but then said there was an error and it restarted the game. Not sure if you got any prizes or anything from the cakes you did complete, or the extras that you tried to complete. So it restarted and when I was able to get on it there was no cakes. It took them completely away. Hours later I got on it while at my mother in laws just fine. Almost 2 hours after I get back home I try to get on the game and it keeps telling me error. It won’t fully load the game. I have tried over 10 times and still get error. I’ve shut the game down and reloaded it but same thing. My last resort is to delete it and redownload it. But will I lose my money, tokens, dice that I already have? Who knows till I try right. So here goes deleting it to redownload. Not happy",Error
2,2023-07-07 12:04:23,It kills time but like any other app its scammy and meant for you to spend money..i racked up over 300 mill just  playing when im bored and got 229mil taken….you can choose who stuff to knock down but you can’t choose who to steal money from…now this wouldn’t bother me as the fake money does nothing for my real life but i mention it because more than likely it was a bot or account thats not actually ran by a real person… the goal there was to keep me playing just like when you low on dice and all of sudden you got a free gift to keep playing or you see tons of ads…anyways I realized it was killing off my brain cells so I deleted because its a endless of nothing the levels go well past 100 like it just goes and goes whats the actual point? So yea i think why people think its more fun and why it go so popular is of course social media and the fact you can play with fb friends…its decent but once you snap out you’re going to play less and less…,Kills time
4,2023-05-24 04:07:01,I love this game. It’s had me obsessed since I downloaded it. The bank heists are so fun and shutting down my friend’s landmarks is always a guessing game if I’m gonna be blocked or not! It’s great. The only thing I don’t like about it is how slow it gets sometimes. I am on board #14 and have 6 rolls every hour. But those rolls are gone in 10 seconds and then I get off the game because I’m bored and can’t do anything. Then I forget about getting back on in an hour and I know it’s making me okay the game less than I would if there were an option to watch ads for dice or an option to ask for dice daily for friends or sending lives to friends like a lot of other games do that connect to Facebook. Overall I say this game is really fun! Just getting cut short on turns every time kind of takes away from the ultimate fun.,"Great, but slow moving sometimes!"
3,2023-11-01 16:44:11,This game can be fun. However the complaints are real. I’ve read other reviews. They really do make it hard to receive any new cards. I think they want you interacting and trading with other people. That’s fun and all. But the ones who do have the cards you need. They sell them and not trade. The app keeps saying error and restarting my game. I’m always in the middle of getting points. It doesn’t save my buildings when I upgrade. So my money gets returned and is available to be stolen. There’s to many problems to name. But I’m seeing I’m not the only one having problems. I contacted customer support and they’re not helpful. Their article even says people are compensated for the trouble. But it’s been investigated and handled. I have not been compensated once. They also cut you off from typing and you’re only allowed to pick their options. Ya they need to get better.,Customer care is horrible.
3,2023-10-24 16:02:34,"I really enjoyed playing this game and would spend unnecessary amounts of time playing! But now  it seems nearly impossible to advance or get many dice to keep playing. I don’t get enough dice to be able to increase my multiplier, meaning I can’t win larger rewards, so now I don’t get anywhere quickly and never win or have the chance to win competitions. When I do get more dice, I seldom land on tiles that give rewards to keep winning. It’s just become lame and repetitive with no advancements now - what’s the point? The same 1-3 star stickers are given over and over, with so many missing 4-5 star stickers (especially the gold ones) so those packs are impossible to win. You only get higher stars when winning competitions- which you can’t do with so few dice and never landing on high rewards.. an endless sad cycle. Likely will stop playing very soon… it was fun while it lasted.",Was fun but now…
4,2023-09-28 19:29:52,"I’m not exactly sure what the problem is, but I can’t get my app to load. I can’t even get on and I was close to winning a competition!!! I lost first place the other day because of a glitch. Then my complaint with the game is, I’m not getting any new cards ever! I roll through thousands of dice to win them and nothing to help. You are making it to hard to get dice. Trade all the multiple cards for dice. Also can we make like a trade deal. Maybe be able to buy rolls with the Monopoly money if you run out?  I also think that the higher the level 50 dice for a complete board is nonsense. I’m on level like 115 and I think at this level of loyal playing 50 dice isn’t enough considering how much it costs to build on each new board. Please fix. I love the game but I don’t want to be frustrated. It’s what I do to chill out…",Glitching and won’t load
3,2023-08-27 01:52:33,"The game was very fun at first. I enjoyed competing with friends and the whole concept. After about two weeks, the game got frustrating. The stickers are increasingly hard to get. People are actually SELLING them on the Facebook group, which is outrageous. You only get seven dice per hour, but in order to win the mini-completions…you almost always have to roll with a multiplier, which diminishes the amount of dice you actually have. I went from having an excess amount of dice to no dice at all. I refuse to spend money on dice, and I can’t even level up because every time I get close to buying a new building, I’m bankrupted. Many other games, like candy crush, give lives every 15 mins or so. Why can’t this game give us like 20 dice every 15 minutes? I’d actually stick around…I’ll likely be deleting because it’s doing nothing but frustrating me at this point. Back to candy crush I go…",Fun at first
4,2023-07-07 23:24:28,"Game kept crashing today! Have been cheated out of a sticker pack as well as money from doing a shut down. This is disheartening especially because I spent money to show support in the game and although the game is fun, making sure it works properly is critical especially when users are spending their hard earn money and challenges are timed. Not giving up on it yet but would like those issues resolved, will update review when and if issues are fixed. Have screenshot to prove issue and made sure game is updated to the latest version and still having issues.  7/7/23 Update the game has been repair and they gave out rewards for those who were affected by the glitch as compensation. Giving the game a 4 star rating and hoping there no further issues moving forward.",Game crashed a lot of times today 7/5/23
5,2023-09-27 00:53:23,"I started playing this game because I can never get anyone to play the board game. I have been playing for a few months now and it seems like as the time goes on the amount of dice u get has decreased rapidly and forget about getting any new cards cause it just hardly ever happens anymore.  My game has glitched a few times leaving me with nothing but losing dice, money not received and sometimes I don’t get the prizes with the contests. I have decreased the amount I play cause I’ve lost some interest in it cause it’s almost impossible to play with such a little amount of dice and the game glitching. I thourghly enjoy playing when I do play but it’s short lived cause I can’t keep dice or get enough anymore. Not everyone wants to spend money every day buying dice to play.",Love the game but….
2,2023-10-20 13:51:05,"The game was so fun and a pleasure to play when I started… Then it got popular and everything changed… Prize amounts changed and that is if you can get them!! I’m convinced the game has bots that “play” hard to grab top prizes and make players play more and spend money. The stickers are absolutely ridiculous now. I can’t get new stickers to save my life and they give less stars now so trading them in is more difficult. Properties cost too much money to advance to next levels and if you stop playing for the day, the amount of money that others can steal from you goes thru the roof (I stopped playing one day and had 30 billion. Went back to play and ONE person stole all my money. That was the last straw) This game got popular and the algorithms, prizes and play changed and I think it’s to drive up play so people buy dice. No thank you. Should have kept the game play and prizes the way it was when it started. ✌🏾✌🏾",Not the same… fun while it lasted!!
1,2023-09-28 18:52:51,The game is rigged… they only give u 5-8 dice and hour… do tournaments but only give you 1 cookie etc fr however many times u r multiplying by… Ive watched this game cheat u outta collecting thing then when u complain absolutely nothing happens… the dice given is so short i gives me a 10 seconds to play then im omw to somebody else’s game like Matchington where i can play all day win rewards with out having to spend money. After gettin so far into it like me it starts to take a billion jus to build one landmark… how long do you think that takes giving you 8 dice an hour lol… waste of time when there are plenty other games I can literally enjoy all day… then they give u duplicate gold cards u can’t trade… last even of sticker I only needed two gold cards to complete the whole album that only monopoly can give for a month in a half all they did was give duplicates and I was never able to win the tournament… it was atp right there I said I’ll never spend another dime on their game again… waste of time n my opinion,Dice
5,2023-10-06 11:19:05,"I started playing about 1 month ago and I just wanna say, I LOVE this game! It’s fun, it is easy to understand, and it is a game I will play anytime I’m bored. Plus, with the amount of events that are always going on, it really hard to run out of things to do! The only problem I have is kind of just a me thing because I don’t like not being able to play after I run out of rolls (yes I know the they regenerate) But overall, great game and would recommend for people who get bored easily. Or if you just wanna play for fun! I also like how you can send/receive cards, it makes the game fun. And when your goal is to complete all the sets… it makes it WAY easier.  Thanks to whoever made this game for giving me a FINALLY good game that I play daily. 10/10 you should try it.",Really good game!
2,2023-09-07 21:26:50,Saying this in the nicest way i possibly can but straight up you guys are idiots. First with this new album you nerfed the rewards all around and made it harder to get dice. Which is completely stupid because getting dice is what keeps people playing the game. And now you guys cap the friend limit for getting 100 dice to just 10 friends making even harder to get dice. Completely stupid. Most people don’t have hundreds of dollars to spend on the game so they can get dice. Oh and made it harder to complete sticker sets by including a gold card in each set. You would think that would entail better rewards but nope guess what you guys decided to give less for completing a set now. All around extremely stupid decisions by the developers. Hopefully you guys realize this when you lose a bunch of people playing the game. Only reason giving 2 stars instead of 1 because i think its a great game but its being ruined by stupid decisions from the developers.,Idiots
4,2023-08-17 00:00:39,"This game is very addicting. I have lots of fun playing, but it’s getting too expensive and the rewards are not worth it anymore. Going up levels, the dice reward is only 50! You give more money, but no dice. The dice should be increasing if not at every level up, maybe at every 25 or 50. Also, a lot of people play this game, we should be getting the same rewards as everyone. I saw a post where there was a technical issue and they received 100 dice and a pink sticker pack. I only received 40 dice. How is that fair?? Also, all the offers should be the same for everyone regardless of the level we are on. Also, as we level up, it’s the same boards. We need new boards. This game could be great, but there are many inconsistencies that need to be worked out.","Love this game, but it’s getting too expensive and the rewards are not worth it."
3,2023-11-04 23:05:06,I really have enjoyed playing this game for a few months but honestly they make it really hard to get anywhere without buying stuff once you advance to a certain point. It’s gotten super slow moving and I’m kind of losing interest. I don’t feel like spending a fortune on rolls. I joined back up to Facebook just so I could trade cards on their “group” they keep pushing on the game but I can’t even get them to accept my request to join the group because I am new to Facebook or prefer to keep my profile private? So that was a bust too. There has been a couple of fairly major glitches. One kept knocking me back a whole level or two and they makers just sent me a few tokens or something I didn’t really need which was super annoying. Not enough to get me back what I lost. But overall there hasn’t been a ton of glitches and it is pretty fun for a bit.,Great for a while
3,2023-10-09 13:11:24,"I really loved this game until a glitch on Oct. 2 reset my game wiping out 30 landmark upgrades between 2 boards, and lost everything I did on the partner event. I filed 4 bug reports over 4 days in which they took my email, and told me to wait 24 hours on the first one. On the 3rd one, I was told restoring could take up to 5 days. I waited. The customer service is a bot that takes the same info every time and tells you to wait. I never was given a bug report #, never got one email nor was able to follow up on the reports. That glitch didn’t just affect me, but affected my partners in the Toy Build event. If I continued playing and my game was restored, I’d lose everything accomplished in the build and my partners would lose, too. If the customer service was an actual person and there was follow-up, I’d give 5 stars.",No real customer service or restoration after a glitch resets your game
5,2023-04-13 00:04:07,"This game is very fun on many ways, 1, it always keeps you distracted. For example, I felt like I was going to throw up in a car, but I pulled this game out and I have completely distracted. 2, you always have something to look forward to when you wake up. If you are like me, you will know that you are constantly running out of dice, and have to wait an hour to get 5 more. Overnight when you sleep, the dice will keep stacking and you’ll have full dice by the time you wake up in the morning since it counts even when you aren’t on the app.   There are things I would change though, I feel like an hour to get 5 dice is way to long, maybe consider turning it down a notch to maybe 45 minutes? Please consider this. Thank you for reading this review.",Why this game is good
3,2023-09-28 21:29:46,It started out great but now it just seems like much thought wasn’t put into the progression of the games. Once you get further in the game the prizes and rewards don’t match the progression. For every board you complete you get 50 rolls and a few million which does no good when it costs billions to upgrade landmarks and you collect money from the rolls. Even the new sticker system doesn’t make sense some players won’t be able to complete the sticker albums because the gold stickers are only given out to people who win the tournaments so if you don’t get first place in the tournaments you don’t get the gold stickers you need. Even the compensation for the outage today didn’t compare to what people lost due to not being able to play. I lost more money from my board being attacked while the game was down than I got in compensation,Not really sure if I like this game anymore
4,2023-09-16 19:15:21,"I think we should get exactly the amout of shields we collect. I collect like 20 but if someone hit me one time, i lose one. If i get hit 3 times i lose all of them and is unprotected though i collected 20 of them. Also the sticker albums great but i think the amount to fill them should be lowered to like five. Other then this the game is great. Edit: something I’ve just became aware of is that people have come up with this strategy where they stop building builds so no one can knock down their land marks. instead they build up their money until they can pay the whole board off and level up while their still knocking other people’s land marks down, but no one can knock theirs down because they don’t have any. I think this should be stopped some how because this makes the game unfair and less fun.","Love it, but! Plus a problem."
4,2023-08-11 12:05:36,"I mean it’s a fun and simple game but too simple . You only do 2 things and that’s railroads which is fine . The main issue is you only get 6 roles a hour and can only hold like 60? You roll 5 times and your out of 60 dice so you get to a point where you don’t even get to play the game , it’s super hard to get the best card packs and even when you do it’s 10x harder to get a decent card out of them so I’ve talked to a lot of people and if it wasn’t impossible to get some of these cards where they make us beg on there Facebook app only to get nothing from other ppl then it would be perfect . Shouldn’t cost a arm and a leg for a 5 star card ! And make gold cards able to do something ! There absolutely useless in this game why do we get so many gold card dupes but can’t trade them or do anything with them lol",Decent but not perfect
1,2023-07-07 15:02:46,"Game was great, basically a better version of an old game called BoardMasters, and this game has no ads. However, since the last update the game is unplayable for me. Every few rolls I get an error and must restart the game and sign in again with Facebook. This happens so often that the game is virtually unplayable, sometimes it’s every time I roll the dice. Annoying, if this bug gets fixed I’d rate it 4 or 5 stars  Update: But was fixed. STILL ONE STAR. Well well well the bug was fixed however when the bug was fixed I and many others lost ALL EVENT PROGRESS some people missed out on THOUSANDS of dice because the devs don’t know how to play test their game before they release an update and the devs compensated us by giving us a measly 25 dice and a blue sticker pack… that is nothing! Try turning that 25 dice into the 600 I lost or the 2000+ that others lost! Terrible way to compensate for a game breaking bug because the devs just want people to keep buying micro transactions and get a few extra dabloons in their pockets.",Great game… until…
5,2023-11-07 15:36:48,"Ok, I gotta fangirl about this game for a second. It’s addicting, it’s fun, it’s competitive, and it’s beautifully designed, but that’s not just why I recommend playing. The real reason is so much better than that: the developers ACTUALLY LISTEN. In the last two updates, they’ve added to rewards, made the process more smooth, and overall made the game more fun to play. If you look at past reviews, more than half the problems they complain about have already been fixed by the amazing update team. For all the people who are saying it requires spending money, I’ve been playing for three months almost daily and haven’t spent a single cent. My heart goes out to the awesome team working on this game, and I definitely recommend downloading",BIG REASON TO PLAY THIS GAME
5,2023-06-13 01:10:50,"Addicting game that’s easy to play plus it is fun to go back and forth attempting to destroy your friends landmarks and there’s a tournaments you can compete in to earn a large amount of rolls . I’ve played a lot of these types of games like coin master, dice dreams, etc. and none are as clean looking or monitored for hacking/exploits but there are elements in those other games that could be incorporated. With that being said, There needs to be something else to spend money on besides paying fees or upgrading landmarks and more ways to earn rolls. Maybe a mini game cycle for when you land on free parking or just visiting for example but if this game wanted to differ from the rest it would try to feel less pay to win like all those other games. Still a great game!",It’s missing something tho…
3,2023-10-16 19:38:36,They give you 8 dice an hour. You will always land in jail until you need the corners for points. Bank heists are ridiculous. They take all your money but the other person only received a small amount of your money. The cards and card trading are a scam. They make you jump through loops to delete your account. You have to X out of 4 promotions constantly. Daily treats go missing sometimes and you never hear back from support. It costs trillions to upgrade properties but the amount of money or dice received will not be to make advancements in the game without spending money. Spend money and you can roll 1000 🎲 and not land on any tokens or bank heists. They want you to spend more money on 🎲. I’m cool with buying boosts for my board. Don’t get me started on the robot 🤖 scam! With all of this and the scammers in the trading group. I’m deleting my account and dusting off the monopoly board.,Money Grab
3,2023-09-12 18:43:37,"You shouldn’t get duplicates of stickers you can’t trade! If you’re going to give multiple of the same gold card at least make it so they’re tradeable because otherwise what’s the point? Especially with this new album having a gold card in every set. Saving them for the vaults 9 times out of 10 is useless because you never get a new sticker.   The game is fun, but make things more achievable for people who can’t spend money on the game. You (game creators) can make money off letting people watch ads for rewards. I did buy an offer that came up last week for $4.99 because it had 2 sticker packs. I did not get 1 new sticker. If you are paying real money for sticker packs there should be no reason you aren’t guaranteed a new sticker.

2,2023-10-16 21:21:57,This game was fun until you get to about level 100. Then it’s no longer fun! And the recent update turn this game into crap! You can’t roll enough to keep up with all the people taking the money from us! It used to be the heists didn’t come from your actual money but now it does! I have went to bed with almost enough to close a landmark and woke to a zero balance! Screw that! People can stack you with so much aggression you also wake to all of your shields down and landmarks are dust! You hand out ice so meagerly it’s ridiculous! I can’t win contest anymore because you put me in a category outside all of my friends! I win nothing now!!! NOTHING!!!! Can’t get ahead with my sticker collections wise you just keep giving me the same old tired stickers I have!!  So I am thinking I will stop playing! And with me will be the other 10 family members I play with plus their friends and so on!  Fix this you greedy jerks!!,Great until level 109
2,2023-09-24 13:05:12,"I loved this game . I played for hours , even spent a little money on it and actually sent it to my friends because i wanted to play with them .

Not even within a week maybe a few days all of my bank was taken from me in big chucks from bots stealing hundreds of millions in the night while i was sleeping to wake up to my game drained . It’s just a game at the end of the day but how discouraging after playing for a while going through boards actually enjoying something for it to all be gone in a few day by BOTS . I’m almost completely bankrupt in the game even while trying to catch up during the day ! Anything that i earned back during the day was taken plus more at night. It’s impossible to keep up with and many of my friends have given up on the game already and i might be following soon if the bots problem doesn’t get fixed .",Loved this game … until the bots started coming in
2,2023-09-20 22:31:09,This game started off fun but quickly became repetitive and greedy. Obviously they want you to spend money on Dice but they won’t get a dime out of me. That means I have to wait an hour to get a measly 8 dice. Unless you use a multiplier you won’t get any 4⭐️or 5⭐️cards. You’d be luck to get any Gold⭐️ cards either. Finishing your boards becomes repetitive and boring as in they’re all the same only the price rises more and more. The cards are the biggest issue as I only need one gold⭐️and 4⭐️ card to finish a set but for the past 3weeks have seen nothing but the same 1⭐️cards over and over. It’s all about getting you to spend your hard earned money to advance and finish your card sets that you won’t be able to do unless you spend spend spend. I guess I won’t be finishing my sticker album because I’m not buying dice. Neither should you. There’s better things to spend your hard earned $ on than this greedy game.,The fun wares off fast
2,2023-09-08 13:06:27,"Monopoly has long been a beloved board game, but recent developments in the digital realm have given rise to Monopoly Go, a virtual version that has sparked controversy among gamers worldwide. The reason? Unfair gaming practices that are eroding the essence of fair play.  In Monopoly Go, the game's original charm has been overshadowed by a slew of in-app purchases, pay-to-win mechanics, and microtransactions that favor those willing to spend more money. This shift towards a ""pay-to-win"" model has left many players feeling frustrated and disillusioned.  Gaming should be about skill, strategy, and competition, not about who can spend the most money to gain an advantage. The essence of Monopoly was always about strategy, negotiation, and outsmarting opponents, not about who had the biggest wallet.  As concerned gamers, it's time to take a strike against Monopoly Go and demand fairness in gaming. We can voice our concerns through social media, online forums, and by supporting games that prioritize a level playing field. By doing so, we can send a clear message to developers that we value fairness, integrity, and the spirit of competition in our games.  It's time to stand up for the principles that made games like Monopoly great in the first place. Let's advocate for a return to a fair and balanced gaming experience, where victory is determined by skill and strategy, not the size of one's wallet. #FairGaming #MonopolyGo #GamingJustice",The game is rigged!
2,2023-07-11 16:03:00,"It’s a great game with a great concept. However recent bugs & issues have made it annoying to play. It kicked you out. You wouldn’t receive all of your rewards. It would shut down in the middle of a bank heist or a shut down, when it restarted it would just send you back before you landed on it. When updating landmarks it wouldn’t always place the houses on the board. You continuously receive the same stickers in a pack. So to progress you either have to beg people to trade or drop some real money to buy dice and star packs & even then there’s no guarantee. You only get 8 dice an hour which will not get you far at all. Again, you have to spend actual money to enjoy this game & it adds up pretty quickly. Lastly, bc of the bugs rewards were sent to players to make up for them but not everyone gets these rewards. I’m not sure how they were selected but it doesn’t seem to be fair to every player.",Good game but has issues
3,2023-06-05 11:25:37,The game is fun well rather it was fun the first 30 boards it’s very repetitive every board is exactly the same you get 50 dice for each board sure you may get a little more cash but you also pay more if you land in jail you get 1 or 2 new items for you board every 100 points rather stars you’ve collected you should be able to use your money to buy more dice or stickers for your albums because asking people in the group gets you nowhere also one of the more annoying things is all the pop ups when you run out of dice or enter the game the options are clearly on the left said of the board we don’t need a constant reminder that’s those options are there or even to have a choice to turn those notifications off I really do love the game but it needs more options more fun I will continue to play I play several times daily but please add more stuff,Gets boring
5,2023-08-10 05:23:03,"i have a few opinions:   1. i do not enjoy the wheel. there isn’t even an incentive to get it because 15 rolls is nothing in this game.   2. constantly getting the same stickers over and over is frustrating. i get it’s supposed to be hard but having 2 gold stickers that you can’t even trade is just ridiculous and pointless.   3. the wait time for rolls is extreme. again, i get the “if we make them wait, they pay for rolls” honestly it just makes it more annoying and less likely to play (but i have horrible self control so)   4. ALL of the beginning things you have to close to just start rolling is too much. 2 is enough.   5. too many things on the side of the game in general.   6. i don’t completely understand what you’re supposed to do with the things on the side (which is probably user error, but there’s too many to even try and figure it out)   7. finally, i think not being able to send rolls is weird. i feel like if social and community is what you’re after (based on the last update that explains the facebook group and blah blah) sending rolls to friends is a great idea! it could work just like the sticker sending.",NEED to be able to send rolls as gifts!
2,2023-11-03 05:17:29,Game has glitches and crashes entirely too often without proper compensation for inconveniences. Game conveniently crashes multiple times during last hours of tournaments preventing you from completing objectives. These tournaments are important as they are the easiest way to obtain packs that can give you missing gold stickers of higher stars. Other way requires you to get 2500 starts worth of stickers to turn in for a card you don’t have. Other events have the potential to give you a gold pack if you win which isn’t easily done because you are competing against people who buy a ton of rolls to complete events at the top so if your lucky you won’t get put in a lobby with pay to play people. This is why tournaments are so important for people who don’t like to pay to play but they conveniently have game crashes that prevent you from completing them to earn the gold packs for missing gold stickers.,Not worth the time
1,2023-10-30 04:33:07,This game has the potential to be great but the creators continue to make it worse and worse. They set this game up to where if you want to be able to play you have to spend money(I am not one who spends the money). It has gotten to the point I don’t play all month just to save my dice for partner events and then they’ve gone and ruined the partner events. With this Halloween one they’ve made it nearly impossible to finish. I usually go in with 7k dice and am able to finish the events with a decent amount of dice left and I went into this one with 15k and I’ve used roughly 20k and I’m not even halfway to finishing this event. I will never understand how they have nothing but complaints on their fb pages (and other platforms) and continue to make it harder and less enjoyable. I think this was the last straw for me and I will be deleting the game. Hopefully y’all can start giving your players what they ask for cause the measly gifts and constant terrible changes aren’t doing it.,Trash game.
1,2023-10-04 09:38:19,"The game seemed fun at first. That feeling fades away quickly. Was great for a week or so. That’s when it became overwhelmingly apparent that in order to get ahead you’d better cough up some cash. Absolutely bombarded with in game purchase ads. The  Then there was the missing dice fiasco. I’d gotten over 400 dice rolls. I exited the app for twenty minutes and when I reopened the app they were all gone. I did not leave it on auto, I dismissed the app and reopened the game to find what I had EARNED was now missing. Support was absolutely no help either. They couldn’t even verify me after I had given them all the information they asked for, which included my game ID. Like, how do you mess that up? Needless to say I asked for a full account deletion and removed the game.

You get the same ones EVERY time!  2. I hate that when you get shutdowns, it moves your building to a lower level. I went to bed last night and was at 20/30 for my building levels and woke up this morning to my score going down to 0/30 from shutdowns! And that’s with all 5 of my blocks there. I have people that just attack me constantly so I’ve been stuck on this board for forever. I’m getting sick of it and am debating on deleting the game. I feel like friends shouldn’t be able to go to your board multiple times in a row to shut down! 3.

3,2023-08-20 14:00:53,"if you liked rolling dice in the board game, you’ll love Monopoly Go! they practically give them away. i love the idea of the multiplier, which considerably increases the rewards. you and your friends can build and destroy to your heart’s content, and the races and plinko (Peg-E) are terrific. the only turn-offs are the constant ad pop-ups that are also icons that clutter your screen when you’re trying to play. we get it, you want us to spend money, but it’s bordering on begging and is a major drawback; and the trading cards are a joke. they give you months to accrue cards for larger prizes, but they deliberately withhold the cards you need, forcing you to ask to trade with other players, who hoard their extra cards or want real money for them. there are even cards you can’t trade for some reason.

I’ve noticed that it’s always an account with no real picture or a name just some generic looking (almost “fake” if you ask me) kind of account. And it’s never someone I’m friends with also, like I can never do a heist on that person who just robbed me I only have an option of robbing my friends so how can this account I’m not even friends with steal so much money from me??? Make it make sense !! There’s no way to search and find this “person” so I just have to accept it basically and move on. I’d like for Monopoly Go to better explain this.

2,2023-07-06 22:50:32,"After you get so far on this game it begins to show how rigged it is. I’m the beginning everything is super smooth not rigged at all but after you reach around 3K net worth you begin to see patterns, The albums for example when you get so many of them say 160 out of 189 thinking your gonna complete it they never give you a new card again. Another example is the bank heist. You always get the money and never the rings or gold I showed my girlfriend my phone and said I guarantee you I’ll get the money and didn’t even look and selected the money ones. This game wants you to do certain things like pay wise and I don’t think that’s fair especially after you do put money into a game and it still shows rigged tendencies. These developers are rich from this app and I can’t win a album for 15k dice and an lion I don’t want to go on Facebook and trade why do I have to do that that’s unfair and bogus so 2 stars for now till I see change",Good game but

It doesn’t matter how high on the boards you get, you still only get awarded 50 dice for finishing them and barely enough money to start your first board on the next level. It’s taking me weeks to complete boards because of the amount of money they cost. I get the same stickers, always. I had 90 days to finish my sticker albums, but now only have 21 days left and I haven’t closed a sticker pack out in over 4 weeks. You can trade ALL cards- making it nearly impossible to finish these sticker packs out. I’m really disappointed right now- they make this game impossible to play (without spending a ridiculous amount of money to buy things in the app) and most of my friends have quit playing… I am thinking about also quitting at this point :(",Upsetting

This has happened for sticker packs that  I’ve received via game play, turned in duplicate stickers, and even worst that I’ve purchased  The game’s algorithm is either broken or intentionally set to put players in the position to spend obsessive amounts of money to attempt to complete the sets which is unethical and wrong and I would like it fixed immediately. I will not make any further purchases as it seems the game owners are exercising greed before its customers. The worst is when you buy the packs and keep getting no new stickers.

One of my partners was recommended by MonopolyGO and I know they are playing because I've been heisted by them, however they have not scored a single point in the car game. Someone who actually knows their partner said it happened to them as well and their partner was participating but no points registered. So obviously there's a glitch. There are only 5 wheels on my board and you can collect 1 at a time, yet it takes 20 wheels to spin the wheel of points once and more likely than not you are to land on a low point spot. As a matter of fact I've noticed several times that my wheel will speed up as I approach the 1000 point spot. I've reached out to support on different platforms without a response.

The replies were generic, when they did reply. They said they would compensate me with a gift and they were very sorry. And the gift ? A few dozen rolls and some one star stickers. They basically ripped me off and won’t address my issues. Beware. Don’t waste your money. They don’t care. I’ve waited long enough to post this, I’ve given them plenty of time to make it right.

1,2023-09-28 14:24:04,This game is absolutely ridiculous! I loved it at first but now with the new album we keep getting same cards over and over again and every single pack has a gold card that it’s impossible to get unless you win first place and with bots it’s even harder to win first!!! Dice refill is ridiculous 8 per hour?!!! You can even play with 8 dice and get anywhere! I am on level 320 and it’s still the same rewards as someone who is less than 100! We need higher rewards for higher levels as cost of building goes up and up! NOW THE GAME WONT EVEN LOAD and is having glitches and shut down and says I have a bad internet connection! I contacted customer service and it took them 45 days to respond told me I would be getting a reward gift and NOTHING! So I contacted again and now it’s been 10 days and NOTHING!!! Fix it!!!

4,2023-09-01 09:04:21,So starting this new album I’ve notice extras YAY!!! Thank you this seems to be much better as far as I’m getting cards and less duplicates I did notice with the album they added on one set (SET 13) a token so that was pretty cool but LESS dice each set but now every 5 boards you have a chance of winning new cards Thank God and the wheel die seem so useless now Great updates im excited to play! ONLY down part about this is STILL you have to wait so long to get dice to play an hour for 8 dice maybe 30mins the longest only because then you have to wait 8 hours just to get 80 dice to play and then it goes so fast because you can’t just roll 1 dice you won’t collect anything so you actually usu it up 80 dice in 10 seconds that you have to wait hours for LOWER THE WAIT TIME and then maybe the game will be perfect !!!,UPDATE on the UPDATE lol
1,2023-08-31 23:42:01,"I did the recent safari sticker album and spent sooo much money thinking I was “getting ahead”. HA. I probably dropped over 200$ easy on it and got all the way to like 178 stickers out of 189 needed with over a MONTH left of game play before the challenge ended. I got TWO new stickers in ONE month and that was also again spending more money. The game is addicting but it’s a waste of money and it pulls you into “gamble mode” if you are hooked on trying to win big.   My opinion, only play with what is given to you and definitely DO NOT give this developer any of your money until they make winning a challenge a little more feasible without squeezing you of your money. Over 200$ is wayyyy worth 15k in rolls and fake money. Smh. So irritated. I will not waste a single dime on them again and I definitely almost deleted the app. But if I leave it alone for ALL day I actually have enough rolls to make it worth 10 mins of playing so that’s all I use it for now.

I love Playing Monopoly Go, but what would make this game fun is having the ability to allow friends that are paired through Facebook to borrow from each other. This would be a great feature and would really make the game even more interesting. I would also suggest that for the stickers we should also have a notification feed of who traded stickers with us.

3,2023-08-05 18:29:27,"This game is very addicting. Like everything there are pros and cons.  A few things I don’t like are:  1 hour for 7 dice is a little crazy to me. I feel like it should either be less than an hour or more dice for the hour. If you know, then you know that 7 dice gets you nowhere. (Even if you wait half of the day to be fully loaded, 80 dice doesn’t get you anywhere especially when you are trying to get rewards from the mini games)   Can’t trade gold cards. This is fine but the game should not give duplicate gold cards when they cannot be traded anyways.   Customer service I don’t think exist. I’ve wrote customer service a few times and they have not answered.   I’ve used discord to receive dice because like I said I’m addicted to the game and wanted to keep playing but once you are dice capped, the game can become very frustrating as dice are hard to come by.  I saw a review that mentioned we should be able to watch ads to play games or something but I feel like Monopoly Go just wants you to spend your money on the game with little reward. I don’t need to look at the “offers” every time I open the app.   I can’t complain too much because I’m constantly on the game 😂 but I feel like there are ways to improve the game to make everyone happy.

I had a somebody take 45 million from me and we wasn’t even friends and it happened twice! You can’t even bank heist strangers all of mines have been friends.

On top of that the dice in the shop is expensive for so little. Second, add an option for teams or groups. It would be cool to have different teams battle it out and the teams with the highest points gets stickers, dice and money. Within those teams you can request dice, trade stickers and make new friends. Lastly, the stickers why can’t we purchase those alone in the shop like we can dice and money. Instead we have to buy them in a pack with money and dice. Making it much harder for us to complete our sets. Can’t really trade with people, because most of the time you’re getting scammed.

I was already spending a little here and there but I stopped all together once this little charges started racking up. It felt as if in order to really play at all I had to spend real money. 1. I was on board 220 and still receiving the same fifty dice per board completion. The monopoly money pay out rose but not even enough to cover one landmark upgrade.  2. After toiling to complete the previous album collection I lost all my extra stickers and was required to start all over again to complete the collection once more.  3. Then we get the new sticker collection and learn that they drastically decreased the rewards for each album.  4. The new collection is also significantly harder to complete as they’ve included at least one gold sticker in each that you can’t trade for. So you’re driven to buy the sticker packets in cash.  5. The amount of rolls you can earn every 8 hours cap out at 80. You only earn 8 an hour. That’s not even enough to really play the game.   I’m incredibly disappointed in the development of this game.

2,2023-09-02 12:29:07,"Finally got an update for this game and all y’all did was speed up the movement of everything. But kept these continuous, annoying pop-ups to buy more stuff. Can we get an upgrade that rewards us more than 50 dice for finishing a board? Why am I on board 100 where it cost well over 100 mill just to finish one section of the board but only receiving a pinch of die. Or maybe a not so predictable algorithm? Like clock work if I land on Luxury tax and roll again I’ll land on Income tax every single time without fail. And that’s just one example. If it cost over half a million to get out of jail then the prize for rolling doubles should surely be better than whatever you roll plus the multiplier. Also these challenges are completely rigged.

It’s a straight uphill battle with little to no give from the algorithm or game setup itself  You get maybe 8 rolls an hour with your max being 80. It takes a stupid amount of time to replenish rolls that it’s nearly impossible to complete challenges in a timely manner. You have to complete challenges fast and all the way through to get the good prizes but it’s impossible to get there with just 80 rolls replenishing every 10 hours.   The idea of collecting stickers was a blast until you’re down to the last 10 and the game gives no mercy to your lack of rolls and how far that takes you. It was a week before I got a new card….. they want you to beg in a trading group where people scam and put a monetary value on these stickers . Honestly the game draws you in to have fun for maybe 2 weeks then they expect you to spend $20-$50 in order to buy enough rolls to remotely get you anywhere near rare sticker packs in challenges.

For example, having a way to request cards from friends in the game would be much more convenient than the convoluted Facebook trading system. Also, there should be a way to turn of pop up deals when you run out of dice; perhaps make it with things like daily rewards to incentivize keeping it on as a reminder.

Make gold stickers tradable like even if it’s just one a day or something like that it would help. If not then make it to where you can’t get dupes of gold stickers it’s a little annoying. 2. Beef up the way you get your rolls back it’s getting annoying having to wait so long for my rolls to refill and by the end of it whatever event I’m trying to do is basically over and no reason to even try to catch up. 3. I understand this is a free app so the pay for things there need to be in the game but other than buying the rolls the first time there is no incentive to continue to buy them which I think can be worked on a little bit. Other than that honestly a really good way to pass the time.,Fixes
3,2023-09-01 20:06:28,"The play, the style, the levels, all are detailed and set up great. The game does have its repetitive play but the events and friends help it not get stale. The biggest and most frustrating thing about this game is the constant pop ups to buy extra dice or money. The moment you log in you are prompted to buy different packs 3-4 in a row. Every time. Once you get low on dice you get 3-4 prompts to purchase dice to keep rolling. The share/ referral of friends to get more dice is very misleading. If you select it will send, en mass to all of your contacts immediately. Both text message and Facebook if you allow. The scaling of price and “hot streaks” you get sometimes with bonuses are all classic “slots” tactics to give a gambling like activity.

4,2023-07-10 20:01:43,"I love this game, there’s something about it that draws you in. My only 2 complaints is that once you get to a certain point with stickers, you get stuck. I’ve joined the trading groups on Facebook but it’s the same 5 cards that no one has that are in high demand. My other complaint is that there are bugs that make you lose out, for one example, my partner on the cake building game wasn’t receiving the work I put into it. It showed as 0 when I really put 26k+ points into it. She gave up on her end and she didn’t receive the gifts on mine- therefore we both lost more opportunities. If you play the game then you understand that you have to succeed in the mini games and sticker collections to play. I wish they would fix these issues as I’m losing my desire to play.",Fun and addictive but stuck and bugs
1,2023-07-08 00:22:20,"The game is fun to a degree. You really can’t get anywhere unless you spend money as well as trade in your stickers, but even that is ridiculous. I have been scammed out of stickers on Facebook.   I have completed the album, and your game should reset the album with new amounts. Well mine hasn’t it’s been 5 days, and when I complete a set I have to contact customer support to send them a screenshot of the completed set. I am waiting on dice from 4 completed sets. They do not respond in a quick manner. Then they tell you they sent you something, guess what there is nothing there.   I don’t recommend this game to anyone. Unless you have a boatload of money, and patience way to many bugs in the game. Not to mention, they do not respond to their customer service, was on a chat for over an hour. Finally, left my email and phone number for someone to get in touch with me, to make this right. I’ll change this review when they do.","Don’t waste your time, unless you have a boatload of money"
5,2023-11-05 05:39:13,"Love the game but there are so many bugs (which get fixed) but I do spend money on this game & the bug that irks me THE MOST is the Mega Heist. Mega Heist has a timer on it, yet it only works once& in order for it to work again (while the timer is still on) you have to exit the game and open it back up. AND when I go to report the issue- I go on the website-click on the game-click on contact support and then all it does is take me back to the original website smh. I’ve tried to reach out on Instagram& tried to ‘report a bug’ on the App Store. I have screen recordings of the game while I’m playing where it’s not working properly. It seems like the only bug that hasn’t gotten fixed. I’m losing out. Love the game tho✨","5 star, bad review"
5,2023-11-03 02:10:42,"Ok, I love this game. Number 1, it doesn’t false advertise! In the ads I have seen they were actually the real game, unlike some other ones. Number 2, the concept is great, with different maps and things to collect it makes things harder to get off ;). As I do think this is a wonderful game I have one tiny suggestion, stickers. With some of the packs it’s impossible to complete it bc you have to join the Facebook group. Sometimes that could be an inconvenience for some people whom don’t have Facebook and/or can’t. Other wise it’s a wonderful game and people who say the rolls are to much waiting, just level up and get the upgrades for them ;-;. Thank you for reading this review and I hope you have a wonderful day/night :D",Developers rule!
4,2023-08-31 19:51:41,"Monopoly Go! Is addictive game. It’s pass the time and even better when played with family and friend. I was introduced to this game about 2 months ago and has been hooked on it every since-to the point I was spending money. I give this game a 4 stars because the wildlife challenge just ended. I only needed one card, which two of my families members had and couldn’t trade because it was a gold card. I understand you can’t trade that , but I wasn’t even given the option to buy the card. Through out the whole time playing I would get the package deal to purchase guaranteed missing card, but the minutes I need it it no where to be found. This was disappointing and should be a way around that. Anyway. I had to vent. Hopefully this will change. I’m headed back to Monopoly Go! 🎲",Addictive
1,2023-10-01 01:48:38,"It’s all fun in the beginning when you getting all new stickers and maybe completing a couple of the album but the fun stops there. The game quickly became so stressful because all the sticker packets you have been getting are all duplicates. You will go on for weeks not being able to complete any of your album. The game suggest you to join their Facebook group page and trade for stickers or ask for help but most of the people on the group are greedy and scammers. What makes it so horrible are they reset your dice after 8 hours with only a little bit of dice to play. With that, you will definitely won’t be able to compete in any tournaments or completing any of the goal. The only way to compete in the tournament are by making in app purchase of their dice. This is talking about hundreds and hundreds of dollars you will ending up spending. Even with that spending, you will still not be able to complete any of your album. This is such a joke!",This game is a joke!
1,2023-09-08 01:45:26,"I have been playing this game since the end of the last album. The last album was great, the dice amounts for the sets were reasonable and they were achievable. Now it’s like you guys want MONEY in order to be successful in the game. It’s sad because the game is actually a fun game. It loses it’s appeal when you can’t make progress due to the fact you only get 8 rolls an hour. The amounts you have to reach to obtain the goals are ridiculously high and unobtainable unless you are spending hundreds of dollars to achieve. It is sad that you guys have resorted to ripping off your customers to make money. Then this album you put a good stickers in each set and lower the dice amounts that you win. As if getting the gold stickers weren’t hard enough to get. Then you can’t even trade them, that is insure! At least put a trade restriction on golds. If you get 2 extras then you can trade 1. Raise the dice amounts for the completion of set, reduce the number of gold stickers, make achievements achievable!",Horrible!
2,2023-08-05 18:39:32,"I played and played multiple times a day. The dice rolls being 7 in one hour is ridiculously low. That won’t get you a shield sometimes. I hate the cards, they are super hard to get. I’ve played other games with the same concepts as this that were far above and beyond funner and more addicting because you actually did something. This game has no point. Why am I waiting an hour to play for 30 seconds and have no progression or anything of substance? I just have a new board to complete, there is no purpose and once you complete the boards they start to repeat. I don’t see the point. There is no mini games or anything to keep you wanting to play. You roll dice and move. Just play an actual game of monopoly… I deleted it because I was tired of watching my board get destroyed because I couldn’t get enough dice rolls to protect it with shields and I played as much as I possibly could. Not worth it.",Deleted within 1 month
1,2023-07-27 01:30:58,Brittanee Collins This game has great potential but you guys really need to get some stuff figured out. For one there's been multiple times that the dice say one thing but my token does not move that many. Secondly you do not offer enough dice rolls and cash for board completion. At least have the rewards grow as you move up every few. Next the cards are ridiculous. I should not be having to spend money and THEN still get no new cards or getting multiple of the golden cards and not being able to trade them. There should be at least once a month or something we can trade golden cards. The cards really out of walk. You have people out here SELLING 5 star cards and less for actual $$$ that is absolutely crazy. The game also has no way of communicating with your in game friends for trading. Not everyone is linked or wanted to go through facebook when there are tons of scammers. Please fix these issues and I promise you'll have a ton of happier players.,Y’all gotta do better
5,2023-09-06 14:30:01,"I am addicted to this game. Many games now a days have too many ads. Not this one. Not a single add has popped up on my screen while playing. Even if you don’t spend money on the game it is easy to complete and play. I enjoy playing with friends and can be very competitive when breaking down each others boards. Though I can get heated when they break my board over night. The game includes stickers to collect and different board pieces you can have. I enjoy the different “events” that take place too! Like right now me and my boyfriend can work together to build a cake! The only thing I would recommend changing or updating is the fact you can only use your facebook, or apple ID to create an account.",My uncensored thoughts.
4,2023-09-25 17:30:15,I absolutely love this game but it’s only getting 4 stars because I’m starting to think they refuse to fix a glitch on here that I’ve seen many many many people complain about like I don’t know if this is a glitch or not but I don’t see the person who keeps attempting to shut me down or is shutting me down in my friends list and then once I got to the revenge page to revenge them but their land had nothing on it and it wouldn’t let me attempt to shut down or shut them down but they keep doing it to me it’s quite frustrating because It’s a game where you should be able to do it back to them cause I don’t have that problem with no one else!! So I’m starting to think the game developers got something to do with it because that ridiculous!,Glitches or whatever they are
1,2023-09-22 13:24:55,I played the choco baking partner event and was able to complete it but yet it did not register that it was completed. With ten minutes left before the event ended my last partner and I had 400 points left to get to finish our cake. My partner was able to get those last 400 points for us completing out the event. He got all his rewards just as well as my other partners. He even sent me pictures showing it was completed. But once the time ran out I never received any rewards. So I’ve tried multiple time to email customer support hoping they will help with the situation but they don’t. At first I absolutely enjoyed playing this game but now just the thought of getting back on aggravates me knowing I’m missing 5000 dice plus other stuff. I’m leaving this review to let others know of y’all’s unprofessional ways of solving problems in your own app. Thanks a lot scopely for all the time wasted trying to complete your event for y’all to just throw a slap in my face.,Fix your problems
5,2023-08-17 22:56:17,"I have read about 20 reviews that talk about the official trading group being scams.   We have created a safe space with a set of rules that have essentially wiped out scammers. I know this probably sounds like a scam itself, but I don’t know how else besides the Instagram or Facebook page to reach people to grow our group. Our group is called Monopoly Go GIFTING only.   The game does need to strengthen the rewards for people and allow players to build more dice at a lower time frame. If you only get the 80 in 10 HOURS!! Your play time is done in 2 minutes. For a game that needs its players, it is sure getting short playing time. But if they are all about the money, then I guess it works. You get addicted and then you want to spend money.",Gifting Group
3,2023-11-07 13:43:38,"Don’t get me wrong this game is fun and addicting but unless you’re on 24/7 and you’re buying rolls, it’s so difficult to win tournaments due to all the bots. Last night i went from 5k to 8k and took first place. Next morning a bot with a stock monopoly go profile picture, passes me by 10k. From absolutely no where. All the other people below me moved up maybe by a thousand or two but going from nowhere on the board to 10k out of nowhere is infuriating, especially when you used all/most of your rolls getting your place. To top it off this bot passed me up like 4 hours before the stupid tournament finished so i have to watch as a bot who can’t even use the prizes, wins my rightful place. Not only that but the amount of duplicate cards is ridiculous going weeks and card pack upon card pack before ever seeing another new card.",Fun but tiresome
3,2023-10-26 16:13:34,"I love this game, it brought my love back for monopoly but i have concerns that make me want to quit all together. Every time I open the app, the pop ups are very overwhelming, if you are just going to display them on the side of the screen why do I have to see them every time. Especially when I run out of dice, it is too much! Also these cards, i HAVE NOT received a new card in weeks. We have all these card events and I get nothing. I get purple and gold packs with all old cards every time. Why work so hard to get these packs with no rewards in the end. When i get a bonus and I do x50 or x100 for example or anything over x5 I never land on the community chest, tokens, or whatever I need to complete the event, but rest assured if i do x1,x2; it will give it to me and I never complete anything. I just feel like its set up for us to fail!",too much and rigged
1,2023-09-27 08:46:10,"Never downloaded a game soley out of spite for their ads, I understand they might not be responsible for tapjoys terrible broken system, but such a well established company shouldn’t be doing business with such a shady company that other giants like warnerbros are canceling out from their apps. The ads constantly glitch, freezing, requiring me to have to close the ad which makes you still have to watch the ad and be active in it, for 30+ seconds. I can’t watch or listen to anything in the background or have pop ups in the background because if you hit the mute sound button the ad literally freezes on purpose to make you have to restart and redo and that’s a major problem for games like need for speed that you only get a few times every day to watch an ad, how I wound up here. If your game was worth playing you wouldn’t need to stoop so low. Waste of data. Garbage concept. Lazy design. A couple someones need to lose their jobs",First time for everything
1,2023-09-24 13:54:03,If I could put negative stars I would. This game started out fun but has become terrible. They’ve rigged everything where it’s almost impossible to complete any event or tournament. Which you have to win to get cards. You start with people who aren’t even in you’re ranking. You can be leading then from nowhere someone who’s not even on the list comes in leading by 10k and goes up as you go up which is impossible to do in such short time. They don’t want you to win. You can’t get the stickers needed. The prizes have decrease the prices on packs to purchase have increased with little to nothing. The wheel boost never lands on that one sticker you need. You can’t land on corners when you need to get the event pieces. This whole game chests worse than the real game at home. Customer service never addresses your issue nor compensates you for mishaps on their part. I and many more are on the verge of deleting the game it’s not worth it,No longer with it should be -5 stars
2,2023-09-01 18:23:20,After playing this game for many months I have come to find it’s no longer fun. I needed one gold sticker for 3 months and never received it because you all wanted me and others to spend $50 on it. NOT COOL!!! Firstly everyone doesn’t have that kind of money for a game that’s suppose to be for fun and also it’s not gambling so why am I spending money . And then there’s the capped dice wow really !!!!!! I see all this is now is a money machine and no longer fun and 👍🏽 to those players who still play and spend I feel you if you feel it’s worth but but those who was in it for pure fun and maybe a peace of mind for a few hours in the day it’s not okay. And lastly I’ve reached out to “customer service number ours times there have been several glitches and many times I did not receive my prizes gifts and whatever else and still no respond. So good luck to y’all who don’t see what this has become about .,Not fun anymore
3,2023-07-05 11:41:51,"The game is great. I honestly don’t even mind spending money on it and I have spent a good amount. It’s fun, relaxing but challenging at the same time. I gave it three stars because WE NEED MORE TRADES, five trades a day isn’t nearly enough. Either add more trades to the daily limit or cut down the reset time. We also need more rolls, I don’t think the refresh time is adequate at all, mainly as we increase levels. The board landmarks, jail and taxes become super expensive but the dice number is the same. Extremely frustrating!!! To the point where I don’t feel like playing at all anymore even tho I’ve spent hundreds $. But I still prioritize the trading part. I personally think trading is the best part of the game and I participate a lot on the official Facebook group, but it’s extremely frustrating for players to wait so long to be able to trade. I really hope you guys fix it.",WE NEED MORE TRADES!!!
3,2023-10-10 10:35:00,"I just wanted to share a little. I’ve been playing for a month or so, and I think I have the knack, or I think. One thing, the Epic Myth game, now 52 days left. I keep noticing that I keep getting the same cards over and over. That makes you not want to play. The last week I have not received any new cards. Not even when you get a reward no new cards. Very annoying, doesn’t make you want to keep playing. The shields are confusing. They only last or are activated while you are on screen? Once you close the game anyone can attack your game? That doesn’t make any sense, because you can be on a roll and have 1500 spins. Once you finish your land is up for grabs? There should be some kind of time limit for all that time you put in. Just a thought. So far I’m playing, and these minor things need attention. Thank you…TeeTee",Monopoly Go Player

Give us bad cards out of cards packs , charge ridiculous prices for packs (which i will never spend money on this game idk why people do so) then atleast make the game fair .. i notice during mega heist i will either never touch a railroad through the whole time or when i do ill get 5-6 shut downs in a row instead of a heist …. You also dont seperate people who blow their whole bankrolls with people who play for free . If you pay you win in this game . The leaderboards are packed with people who have shown in the officla group theyve spent near thousands .

3,2023-09-10 17:47:00,"So, the game is fun but it’s also super frustrating when the trading cards given as prizes are always repeats and a “gold card” is required to complete a set of stickers for more prizes. Of course the gold cards are IMPOSSIBLE to get and there aren’t enough for everyone. Forget trading for one, because they’re not tradable, although you can collect more than one. IF you are ever lucky enough to get two of the gold cards you can’t help anyone else out. What’s the point of awarding extra golds if they can't be traded? That takes away from someone else getting it and progressing through the game. Dice rewards are far and few between and require tons of dice rolls to earn them. So it’s basically pointless, you waste all your dice to earn dice. Extremely counterproductive.  Some people actually pay REAL money to get more dice like WHAAAAT!? This is a game. Nope.",Frustrating
1,2023-09-11 14:59:16,"This game is fantastic, overall have enjoyed playing it everyday for a few months, can be hard to get dice and there is a constant spam of pop up ads to purchase dice (which are insanely expensive for how little dice they give). It hey have recently made a lot of changes which are very anti consumer, changing how you earn stickers which is how you can earn bonus dice, facebook referral links which could grant extra dice is now limited to your first 1000 dice then you can never earn more. The packs of stickers have some near impossible odds, and when the season comes to an end they are so greedy you can buy basically a package that will guarantee one missing card which is so greedy and predatory. This game has so much potential to stay good for a long time, but most apps tend to end far sooner because of developers like this who choose greed and Nicole and diming the player base over choosing to support them.",Greedy developers ruining another otherwise great game.

One thing I don’t understand  is why you don’t get more dice from completing more and more boards. It would be a good incentive and make people want to keep playing the game if they got a little more then 50 when you complete a board,the higher up you go the more dice you get. Also why does it take so long to get a new card for the albums  I can play for hours and days before I get one. As far as I have gotten in the game  I shouldn’t have to use all my dice and not get get anything .

Even if/when I do spend, I still can’t get enough money to build up my board. If I can’t build up my board, I can’t really get stickers. I barely get dice, 80 dice does absolutely nothing for me at my level.  I was excited for the updated sticker album, just to be super disappointed because you’ve lowered all the dice rewards and added a gold sticker to every pack. I honestly feel like the higher you are in level/boards, you should get better rewards. 50 dice for completing a board and 80 dice every 8 hrs is absolutely ridiculous and a joke. I also feel like you make the rewards pretty much impossible to get. Like I have to collect 800 tiles to receive 900 dice.

3,2023-07-24 22:56:41,"1. The sticker algorithm is terrible!  You can play for WEEKS and never get NEW stickers. Once ( if you're lucky) you get a gold sticker - you all of a sudden,  get multiples of that and you can't trade it or give it away!  You spend money or use all of your rolls to try and get the pink packs - of course- no new stickers, more duplicates.  2. As you advance levels... You would think that the number of rolls would increase the same way the money /real estate increases instead of staying at 50 for each board.  3. The tournaments/events require far more rolls than the payout. You can't possibly expect ppl to pay $99 for rolls that still won't get you to the end of the events.  4. Waiting an hour for 7 out of your possible 40-80 rolls is horrible.  How can you be expected to play if you're waiting 6-10 hours for a full bank of rolls.",Great game but problematic

The game has no sustenance, it’s the same thing over and over again. The only way to move forward is to spend days trying to complete a board, unless you get a lucky streak. Those don’t happen often. When you run out of rolls, they immediately force you to look at 3-4 different purchase option tabs that pop up. The entire game is slow, the animations take forever because they want to make it seem like there’s actually a game. There are competitions you can partake in to gain benefits, but the game is designed to force you to spend money to win. They don’t even try to hide the fact that in EVERY SINGLE one youre competing against bots who automatically stay at the top unless you spend a ton of money to beat them.

5,2023-05-18 03:05:33,So this game worked perfectly no issues until the update then once the update was completed  it just stayed frozen you can’t play or push any of the buttons the background some time loads black and the little people move around but h can’t play the game like I said before the update I was playing with no issues and yes I have uninstalled it reinstalled it and forced closed the game app still doesn’t work and it’s not just mines it my husbands phone /game as well wish they just go back to the game before the update was made you so stars are based on the game before update 5 stars now after the update I’d say a 1 star so once the app is fixed and I can play it again I’ll give it 5 stars,Love this game but has major issues
3,2023-09-28 19:21:17,"this game could be better if they gave out more dice per completing board and daily task and every 8 hours. you have to wait eight hours to get eight dice, which is ridiculous. I believe that should be a lot more than a dice every eight hours should be eight dice every hour or if you’re gonna do eight hours there should be 64 dice at least. as in now, I think this game is more about collecting money to get more dice than about the players having fun. and also with the add in Facebook friends, it seems like the meter stops at four and does not let you go beyond that which is unfair when you added over 10 you should get those dice but it does not give it to you and then I also don’t think you should be capped on this game because there’s no other way to get dice.

I won’t  use the Facebook page to share stickers either, since I don’t trust Facebook with my information.  The event ends in 11 days and then there will be new album stickers to earn and trade.

I will be in the middle of getting prizes or a shut down and after the error message occurs and restart multiple time I just give up and close the game.

You open 50 packs of stickers and not get one new sticker. Why is that? And also, why can’t we trade gold stickers? I only need 3 more gold stickers to complete this album which is album 2, and I can’t for the life of me get those stickers. Would be nice if we could trade gold stickers. Over all 5 star game. It brings strangers together to work together and that’s the beauty of it. There are some bad apples in the group though and we should have a report option as well.",Addictive
2,2023-05-14 14:11:56,"Let’s get this out up front. The game is a blast. I could play this for hours, if I was rich and that’s the rub. It is way to expensive to play for extended periods. It suckers you in with a lot of free rolls when you start but after you use them, you have to wait an out just to get 5 rolls and that’s assuming you don’t power up your rolls at all, which is the only way to make significant money in the game. It’s another game that’s extremely entertaining but you just can’t afford to play a lot. And that’s unfortunate.  **update** as you play, you start to see how shady this game is. You often land on shields when you don’t need them and the free dice are fine but when you don’t have any, it’s not uncommon to roll over 50 times and not land on shield once. How unlucky that you can hit jail multiple times during this stretch and that’s one tile. Unfortunately, it’s pretty obvious that the dice aren’t random.",Very fun but very expensive
3,2023-10-29 20:26:00,"For starters I just want to say that I absolutely love this game and I am addicted to it. However, I’ve been playing for about 3-4 months now and I’ve come to slowly hate it the more I play.   For starters, it takes too long to get dice. Waiting for 7 dice every hour is ridiculous. The price of dice is ridiculous. I’ve spent at least $100 on this game and it’s hard to win a tournament, let alone a partner event. On top of that it’s even harder than that to get the stickers you need to complete a set/ album.   Each event requires more and gives you less. There are bots on this game that make it impossible to win/ compete. It’s very sad for a game that I love so much to become so stressful and frustrating. It takes the fun out of everything.   Also, if you’re trying to trade for stickers; it’s too easy to get scammed. You can lose multiple cards trying to get one and there’s nothing you can do about it. This game is money hungry and even if you spend money , you have a hard time.   As much as I love this game, if I don’t complete this partner event after all my hard work & money spent, I have no choice but to delete and never play again. Please do better monopoly! People can barely afford food. This is ridiculous.",Great game & Super addicting but cost too much
2,2023-10-29 16:33:13,"Overall, the game is definitely playable and somewhat enjoyable, even for free players. I knocked off 2 stars because of the volume and placement of pop ups selling in game items for real world cash. Nearly every time you open the app or run low on dice or Monopoly money the game throws spammy pop ups to buy more. This would just be a nuisance on its own, but the sleazy part is that the button on the pop up to confirm a purchase lines up with the button you press to roll your dice. If you’re not careful, you could easily accidentally purchase something you didn’t mean to purchase. I knocked off an additional star because it’s fairly clear that the outcomes of “random” events in the game (dice rolls, spinners, etc.) are at least loosely controlled to keep you engaged and push you towards buying things to get the reward that’s often dangling just out of reach.","A bit spammy and a little sleazy, but playable"
3,2023-09-28 15:02:08,"The game itself is so addictive And enjoyable however, there are rewards you get for logging in daily. I’ve been doing so for 4 months straight but when i get the big award it doesn’t give me the origin 2 that i was supposed to get. It’s a scam. Then there’s times where it picks and chooses when I’ll get “board rush” I’m constantly rushing my boards one time i rushed 4 boards and did not get any “board rush”.   Today, while i know there is a strike on the game I try to log on and I keep getting ERROR! But I’m sure once i log in all of my shields will be gone. I had 600 dice and somehow not one time landed on a shield which I only had 2 of on the board which isn’t right.   The stickers. In two weeks I have accrued 1500 duplicates. Multiple of my boards are empty because I’m not getting any new sticker. Then you can’t trade gold stickers but somehow can get duplicates of those. I don’t think this game is created for people to actually beat the sticker packs because the 2 times I’ve played the sticker challenges I always get stuck where i need 7 stickers for over a month and then it restarts.   Not to mention there have been times where I roll a specific number and the game will move the piece less spaces. Monopoly count your mfn days😮‍💨😤",Addicted and Disappointed
4,2023-09-20 16:56:31,"It was fun! I started out playing. We shared cards. We talked about the events and how we were doing. Building the cars was fun. The cakes were ok. Peg-E came around to give us something else to earn rewards. But recently, the game has fallen flat. Basically, if you aren’t paying the play, you’re not going to play much.  Dice are hard to come by. Landing on the right square happens less often. Earning very much on the community chest happens less often. I feel like the game just went downhill with all of the other games. The developers just want your money. I can get behind a game that you might spend $5/month on. But this game doesn’t even make it worth it to spend $20 on it.  Because you would need to pay more ten minutes later. No thanks. Not worth my time.",Started out fun
2,2023-09-08 22:42:38,"This game is a huge money grab and the creators are definitely scamming its players. For example, the rewards that you win throughout tournaments for completing shut downs and money heists are not only small, but sometimes, they don’t credit them to your account at all. This causes you to lose even more in the game if you’re a person that strategizes and plays during certain times to get the most winnings. It’s also considerably and noticeably harder to land on certain tiles while some events are active. I’ve been missing at least 4 rewards in the last 2 days, contacted customer service each time just to have a record of how many times I haven’t been rewarded but still nothing. They only ever gave me 70 dice 1 time for not giving my rewards and I believe that was for everyone who plays the game, which is fine but I also think it’s only fair to compensate per lost reward.",Money grab
1,2023-09-06 09:06:55,"It got worse, I waited a full five days after I spent my money to be compensated. Missed out on 2 tournaments and only have been missing one sticker for a week. This morning I wake up and I haven’t been compensated properly I was missing 30M, 180 rolls, 12 sticker packs and they compensated me 2 packs and 130 rolls that’s it. Absolutely DO NOT spend your money, after this happened I noticed a lot of people are saying the same thing! I know it’s the big hot addiction game right now and I can’t wait for this company to be tossed to the side like they do their PAYING customers!  Update 9/6  Provided evidence to support of what I purchased and what I was compensated with and they told me that it’s basically too bad and they have already properly compensated everyone affected. Even though I have screenshots I included with the improper compensation. I deleted the game. I DO NOT suggest anyone spend actual money with them. And I’ll be telling anyone who will listen to delete.",Came to update my review
2,2023-09-28 18:48:01,"So the app doesn’t work at all today - “maintenance” as Scopely claims or in response to the planned boycott over app issues?  So this will prevent me from getting the daily quick win prize for the week, as well as missing out on the 220 dice in the pick up event.  I’m still getting notifications from the game but can’t log in to see what is happening… is my bank still being heisted and my shields & landmarks shut down by bots even though I can’t log in to play???  Highly likely.  Since the new album started there have been multiple times when the gifts earned in the tournament so not activate (most often mega heist, cash grab and high roller) - so I end up wasting dice and not getting the reward for it.  It’s a known issue and yet they still haven’t fixed it.    Recommendation - don’t waste your time and money on this game until Scopely fixes these known issues.",Fun game but way too many glitches
5,2023-10-08 01:26:55,Ok I have a few suggestions and if y’all use them I want to get paid lol just kidding. Using the link to share invite doesn’t work please fix. There should be a chat where you can chat and share pictures with your friends to ask for and send stickers directly with the people you play with. I was only playing with people I know and monoply allowed others on as well. I think that is cool. However after level 100 the rolls per board should increase and please stop giving the same sticker sets back to back. Also I dislike the update you all did with the sticker sets taking away as many rolls and there are many people playing it forces some of us out that doesn’t want to pay,Cool game
2,2023-08-15 06:03:33,At first I loved the game. I was ahead of my whole family. I would spend hours and hours on the game. I’m level 2427. And I still haven’t gotten all the cards. I keep playing every day. Whether it’s 2 times a day for only 80 dice after waiting hours and hours for them. Or I get all hyped up because I finish something and get like 400. But with me being my level I don’t think I need to wait almost 3 to 4 hours for just 80 dice. And the card algorithm isn’t good at all. I haven’t gotten a new card in about 2 months. But I still play almost every day. Yeah I get higher cards are more rare. But playing everyday for about two months with no new cards??? I mean come on. I’m about ready to delete the game. My entire family(about 10 people) can’t trade cause we all need the same cards. Can y’all please fix this or something. It’s getting way out of hand and I just wanna delete the game,Cards and dice
2,2023-08-03 01:01:12,"I’ve been playing this game for a little over a month now and I’m realizing that a lot of the mini games like the tournaments or events were you have to land on a tile are way too high stakes. It takes way to much effort for very little rewards. I’ll use the current event as an example: I have to collect 1,200 cotton candies for a reward of a little more than 600 dice? That’s crazy. Not to mention, you can only really complete any of these things if you play all day every day because they’re only available for a day or two, but that means you have to spend money for more rolls. I get it, this game is supposed to be a cash grab for the company but at this point I can’t even enjoy it. Another this is that there needs to be better sticker rotation. I haven’t gotten new stickers in weeks and haven’t been able to complete any albums since I’ve started playing.",There needs to be some changes
3,2023-07-29 01:35:06,"Fun and entertaining app but Are friends really playing against each other?  The app doesn’t seem to actually reflect what is happening with others on the app. Me, fiancé and other family have added and played with one another. We realized that when it states someone took money from us or shutdown our building, it doesn’t actually match what the opposing player did. The leaderboard is out of order and has higher ranking net worth’s listed last on list instead of on top. The railroad shut down also does not show the accurate board that the person is on. And why are multiple images of people listed on different buildings on my board that I don’t know and are not friends with me? It’s just confusing and feels like I’m solely playing against an algorithm and not friends.","It feels like playing against an algorithm, not friends?"
1,2023-07-27 02:10:00,This game has great potential but you guys really need to get some stuff figured out. For one there's been multiple times that the dice say one thing but my token does not move that many. Secondly you do not offer enough dice rolls and cash for board completion. At least have the rewards grow as you move up every few. Next the cards are ridiculous. I should not be having to spend money and THEN still get no new cards or getting multiple of the golden cards and not being able to trade them. There should be at least once a month or something we can trade golden cards. The cards really out of walk. You have people out here SELLING 5 star cards and less for actual $$$ that is absolutely crazy. The game also has no way of communicating with your in game friends for trading. Not everyone is linked or wanted to go through facebook when there are tons of scammers. Please fix these issues and I promise you'll have a ton of happier players.,Do Better
2,2023-10-29 21:35:48,When I first started playing this game I loved it I even had my friends start playing but the longer I play the more ridiculous it becomes. First why only 80 dice? Or when you complete a landmark you only get 50 nobody can do anything with that amount. I understand this is a business but this game is robbing people blind or the one’s who actually spend me I will not spend another dime and a lot of people are saying the same thing as me. Everyone looked forward to the partner event but more people are frustrated with it because the game is rigged can’t land on the wheels and people are blowing through their dice to get it but gee thanks for the very little amount of dice we get after waiting hours for it.  Nobody is getting new stickers just the same ones over and over it again. I’m so close to deleting this game and I’m not the only one. Greed will shut this business down,Greedy
5,2023-10-29 18:00:33,"Why or why can’t they make anything easy.  I know being alittle challenging is good but when you get so many sticker of the same thing is dumb.  I traded in 2500 stars and didn’t even get a sticker that would complete any one of my sets.  So disappointing,  I love to play the game but I can’t afford to pay and play.. I have bought extra dice but never gets me anywhere but with more stickers that I don’t need Why do you only give so many of certain ones You make it to where you have to roll 5 or 10 dice each time to even advance with higher dice rolls.  After this set of stickers probably won’t be playing if they can’t make it less frustrating  Every time you pass go you should get extra dice instead of cash   Nobody is ever struggling for cash we all need dice  Or give more dice somewhere else on the game that everyone has a chance to get  Right now the only one that can get extra dice is the one that roll 5 or 10 at a time  So frustrating to be left out every time cuz you just can’t keep up  Make it more enjoyable for everyone not just the ones that can afford to pay you all","Monopoly dice, stickers"
3,2023-09-28 06:42:22,"Right off bat this is a stupid easy game to pick up. My toddler watches me play all time and can figure it out. However, the things that I don’t like stand out more. Number 1, definitely feels like RNG systems are in play here. That sticker you been hoping for awhile now? Your chances of getting it, is made easier by using real money to purchase things to earn it. You blew thru your dice in 5 minutes? Then here spend a few bucks to get more dice back. Sensing a pattern? From the word go, as in opening the app, you’re bombarded by ads to make purchases. You have to click out of 3 or 4 different screens before you can play. After your dice is spent, or in game money is spent BAM more ads. Honestly, if i was hounded by ads so much I’d give it another star. The fun stuff is great. The not so fun stuff really hurts. Yes even for a mobile game.","Fun, Mindless, and Nagging"
1,2023-09-20 19:02:26,"The game used to be fun but with the latest updates they seem to have installed bots to compete against us in tournaments. They have turned the game into a money sucking slot machine instead of a game. The bots wait til the last 5 min of tourneys and jump into first place out of nowhere. Also playing with multiple people, the attacks are different. I attacked someone with no shields, my sister, and she had plenty of leftover landmarks. My mom also went to attack at the same time and she had none, they’d all been destroyed. Somehow people or bots have managed to attack me 10 times in 1 minute, literally. That should be impossible due to having to land on railroads every spin without any heists. I’ve taken screenshots. The game cheats it’s players in an attempt to make them spend money. That’s unnecessary because I was spending money anyways just out of the fairness and loving the game. Gold packs are impossible to get a new gold card in. No point in spending money now.",Beware of bots
4,2023-09-02 18:32:13,I really like this game but I wish there was more to it than just building and rolling dice etc. But most of all we need it so we can trade dice! I have talked to my friends who play monopoly go and read a review that agree that we need this! I feel like we could have more updates to the game than just events. I also think that the time to get dice is a little to much I think that it could be at least 10 minutes. My friend has this problem where she has gave somebody a card and the other person promised to give her a card she needed and they never did so I feel like we need a thing on monopoly go where we can report those things! If you were reading the reviews to see if you wanted this game I would recommend but this game isn’t for everyone.,It’s okay.
1,2023-08-26 23:28:08,"Like most games it’s very easy and fun at the start of the game just after a couple hours you eventually run out of gameplay you didn’t have to wait one hour to only be able to play for five more turns before you have to wait another hour this process continues over and over making the game less desirable more and more deeply it, no matter if you have family or friends that can increase the games fun by just a small percentage but in the end it still comes down to waiting for your turn which is always in one more hour you are continuously attacked and lose the money that you earned making it nearly impossible to play the game this game really wants you to purchase morals which are extremely over priced for the very short period of time that you actually get to play. I do not see this to be a long term game this game will not last very long most people will give up and delete the app",Only a few hours of fun
2,2023-08-16 23:36:06,With 14 days left in this sticker album it is infuriating that it seems impossible to win the last 3 gold stickers I’ve been trying for weeks to win to complete my slumber. I’ve spent over 300$ and opened over 100 packs and keep getting duplicate gold cards that are no use to me. I’ve turned in 1500 stickers twice as well and didn’t receive any new gold stickers. I’ve come in 1st place in 3 tournaments and also didn’t receive any new gold stickers. The game is becoming less enjoyable with the feeling I won’t complete this album over 3 stickers I’ve been trying for weeks to get. I will say after completing the monster truck game i won a gold sticker {why I only need 3 more} but now that I have it of-course after not being able to get it for weeks it now is appearing in packs and I have duplicates. I’ve been investing time and money into this game and get nothing in return.,Unfair algorithm

Scamming, on the other hand, is going to get a lot worse if something isn’t done about it. Maybe an in game trade? Like a visual trade showing what card is being traded and it won’t go through until both check boxes are checked stating that the other person has put in the correct card… that would be a great idea..I remember playing a game on Facebook called YoWorld way back and that’s how the trades worked. Also, why are we getting duplicate gold stickers if we can’t trade them? It’s annoying working hard to win a purple pack and getting a duplicate gold sticker and another duplicate four star stickers.

3,2023-06-19 13:28:42,"This game is very fun. Its a great way to waste time if you’re bored or waiting on something. Especially when you have plenty dice. But my problem is that im on level 3,123 and im still getting 50 dice for completing boards which is the same amount as someone who just started the game which i think is unfair. I feel the higher the level, the more dice you get for getting to higher levels. For example levels from 1-1,000 should get 50 and then from 1,000 up, we should get a little more like 75 or 100 maybe to keep us motivated in playing the game.   The stickers are a huge problem because i get a bunch of sticker packs every time i play and all i get are duplicates. Its very annoying. I have to share stickers in order to complete my sticker packs. That also discourages me about playing the game sometimes.",Completing boards and stickers
1,2023-11-10 10:51:08,"The thrill of the game ended a while ago for me but I love the building tournaments with the partners. I have some questions though and I know I’m not the only person that feels this way. Why do we not get any new stickers? You said come first place in the tournament we do it’s the same card. Why is it you can sell me a card and give me the card I need to complete a set but if I win it it’s a card for a random set that’s no where near being complete? Why can’t we do anything else with the money? We should be able to buy cards, buy pieces and even the shields. Why is the refill dice so slow and low? We don’t mind spending money to play but when you reach the higher levels it gets harder to make and spend money when you only give boost like we just started playing the game. I can honestly say this is the first time I did not even play the game this week and I see it’s a nice prize at the end but the game is losing my interest.",The game
5,2023-08-06 04:40:18,"The game is super fun! No annoying ad pop up! Yes it does ask you to spend real money on the game but it’s not really necessary, the longer you play the more dice rolls and money you will earn. I started winning hundreds of dice rolls just in the 4th level! The funnest part is seeing friends or family playing the game and doing bank heists against them or trying to shut down their landmarks. Definitely my favorite game so far! I’ve even got my husband hooked on it and we try our best to steal as much money as we can from each other🤣 100% recommend playing this!

Now since the update the game belongs in the garbage. You can no longer progress unless you spend money. If you decide to spend money the items you’re buying are insanely overpriced. The bugs, glitches and crashes are out of control. Customer service is absolutely abhorrent and non existent. They’ve added so many bots into the game that you can no longer win tournaments.

It is really disappointing to have these different glitches that happen when you are using up your stickers and all of your rules.

1,2023-10-13 10:53:16,Been playing a few months now contact customer service is a joke I been contacting them over a month now about mega heist and high rollers no showing up when I win it. The last event the Toy event glitched I lost dice and progress then a day before the event ended I found out I was partnered up with someone who had 4 people and I wasn’t one of them But somehow he was on my board and was my partner. I was upset because I spent over $80 buying dice and packs just to win the Toy token to finish my row of tokens. Customer service finally sent something but it was 35 dice 🤣🤣. Didn’t have the courtesy to email me or write me. Just sent 35 dice like I’m bothering them. So I quit I been playing candy crush for 10 years and never had a problem with glitching I’m guessing they need to go across the water and take a few classes in how to run a business. Cause candy crush would never. Until they make it right I won’t be playing.,Feel cheated
4,2023-07-27 15:02:12,So I absolutely love this game and really want to give it all five stars except there is one feature that really needs an upgrade. There are many ways to get money and rolls. You absolutely dont have to spend a dime to play and move forward. But the trading cards system is flawed. The cards at higher levels are almost impossible to get even when spending money and it seems like everybody is looking for all the same cards it makes it hard to trade and then you have no guarantee the other person will honor the trade. People are scamming and even asking for money. I suggest they make a change where you offer a trade and the other person offers one back so there is no trickery going on. If they can fix that this game would be 100%,Really love this game but….
2,2023-09-20 23:44:35,"The reviews for this game must be from new users. The game is extremely fun at first. Feel like you can almost play at any time you want throughout the day. Later on though, nothing makes sense. You get so little from the community chest that it’s not even worth doing the annoying mini game, the 20 rolls you get here and there as prizes do absolutely nothing for you. The fact that the prizes for completing boards doesn’t increase is crazy. Once you hit max on everything like daily rolls and rolls per hour, there’s nothing left to gain.  Lastly, this season of albums is SO bad. You can tell this company is greedy. Every album needs one card that can’t be traded and every album gives you a lot less of a reward than last season. Use to love this game, but after a week of nothing but last place in the events and just enough rolls for 5 min of fun, I’m over it.",Game gets worse
3,2023-09-01 04:07:31,"Let me start by saying I have had so much fun playing this game and have spent a small fortune. I have 2 accounts. One I have spent over $1000 on. I completed the albums twice and honestly if I would have spent more money I could have completed a third time. Having 2 accounts I was able to trade myself stickers when no one else could or would. The other account I spent exactly zero dollars on. I could not even complete the album one time. Those elusive 5 star and gold stickers. I was very excited for the reset of the sticker album season but now you have to have a non tradable sticker for ever album and the rewards for completing each album is drastically lower. So less dice rewarded, less chance of stickers, more money you will have to spend. I guess they got greedy.🫤",Could be amazing but all they want is your money.
5,2023-06-07 23:50:46,"Love this game and I actually have been spending a lot of money on it - which I never really allow myself to with these kind of phone games so that says a lot.    Though one major issue I have is - I've searched for an option to just pay for the game but there is none and so I'm stuck having to escape out of approx a million different pop-ups everytime I run out of dice. I cant understand why the developers dont just have a version where you pay for the game, pay for the special offers or extra die and leave it at that. At least I'd like the option. Would gladly pay for the game but will have to uninstall now because I cant deal w the pop-up ad situation. Kind of sad cause I love the game.",Great game but
5,2023-09-20 21:27:05,"Let me start out by saying I love this game! It’s highly addictive and the thrill of it all gives you this high!   There is definitely areas that need some improvement like having to wait a full hour for 8 dice is irritating. Let alone the price of buying dice and bundles is outrageous! I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game.   I’m on board 265 and over level 11,000 but having to wait and to keep getting 10+ of the same sticker is ridiculous and not being able to complete the albums let alone only be able to trade only 5 daily is ridiculous. Let alone the daily and the 8 hour gifts of 18 dice?!?! Then let’s wait another 8 hours for 15 it’s like what’s the point?!",Disappointed Daily Player
4,2023-05-31 19:09:23,"This game is such a fun and refreshing take on the board game. The bank heist, knocking down ppls monuments be able to build your own boards however. Theres isnt much customization yet and once you complete a board it basically becomes irrelevant. Not only that but you run out of dice so fast bc in order to progress quickly you have play at a higher multiplier bc the monuments are so expensive. We should be able to watch videos for more dice. Also when you run out dice theres nothing else to do. There should be other mini games that you can play to accumulate more dice or maybe even play a quick version of the original board game, where all the building are divided up or may e something entirely different. Its a great game but it needs more features!",Fun and Captivating but….
3,2023-10-29 15:10:22,"I use to love this game and had my family play. The higher level we played the more we noticed we never get stickers we need,( even sending each other stickers), to complete sets with higher dice counts. Also, if you pay for packages and specials you MIGHT get a sticker to complete a set. I am so tired of Pop Ups. I understand we will get a few pop ups but it’s kinda of ridiculous to get 4 opening the game, 3-4 when dice run low.   POPUPS All THE TIME!!!!!  A positive thing about the app is I like the graphics and game itself. It’s pretty cute and addictive. I just hate all the technical aspects it come with, especially constantly wanting me to interact on social media. I’m not active on social media like many others. Hopefully things get better or I will go ahead and delete. Good luck public and happy play time.",It’s okay I guess.
4,2023-09-08 18:48:26,"My game continues to freeze, during rolls, after starting and during wheel spins. Half the time I don’t even believe that the “rewards” I’ve “collected” even deposited into my account due to these freezing moments. I have to constantly close out and restart my game. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled thinking that just might fix it but nothing. Maybe it’s just the current update? I havnt had issues until recently, Not really sure what’s going on, I have pictures and screen recordings as proof if there’s anyway we could get this situation fixed that would be awesome!

3,2023-09-15 13:12:44,I don’t know a game that’s better at being addicting or promotes itself so well besides the fact they don’t want anyone playing. Due to the fact that every time you are close to beating an event that you have been doing fantastic on once you are one spin away from getting a drastic amount of rolls (for free without spending any money) the board becomes scripted and you will NOT hit the item to finish your event; therefore it is just completely obvious it is a cash grab (not the good kind either lol) what other phone game do you know that requires you to wait the equivalent of a work day to get a maximum of 80 spins? I won’t even go on about how scripted the sticker collection is as much as I like this game it is so completely obvious all they are after is money (which is normal I get it) instead of a player base,Addicting as ever but
4,2023-06-28 02:52:51,"I absolutely love this game! I have never written a review on an app before. I genuinely enjoy my time and spend money willingly and non-regrettably. The only thing is, I wish there was a way to report players on this. I am a part of multiple monopoly go trading groups for the cards and have been scammed multiple times. Now whilst I know that it is a possibility that I will get scammed, I wish I could report the player so others don’t get scammed by the same people over and over. As a player who does spend money, helps other players out by trading cards and is involved in the community as a whole I would love if some sort of accountability was encouraged. Please take this into consideration as I know I am not the only one with these thoughts. Thanks and game on 🤗",Report option
2,2023-07-05 22:41:16,"As soon as you log into the app you get 3-4 pop ups that try to get you to spend money. Then god help you if you run out of rolls bc you get those same pop ups each time that happens. Ignoring all of that, the game doesn’t incentivize you to move up boards. You basically just level up your board to max, then you go to the next board which is the same but a different city. It gets dull after a while. They occasionally add a plinko mini game but take it away after a few days. This game doesn’t give much and asks for a lot. Not to mention it encourages you to login through Facebook to even access community chest for the data mining. At the very least, if you are bored and like to just roll monopoly dice on the same classic board, it does that. The art on the boards are also decently nice. Overall, definitely not worth the money and not 4.9 stars.",This App is insanely money hungry
1,2023-10-30 13:25:16,"This is fun but the only way to actually win tournaments or events is to spend money. There’s times like right now where the rolls are insanely hard to come by, and there’s a huge event that they made wayyyyy harder and no one was expecting it to be so hard. I only need one more sticker out of 189. So I literally do not get rolls from anything other than waiting every hour to get a measly 8 rolls. Or I can get maybe 50 rolls a week from giveaways lol! The events do give out rolls but you need rolls to compete. It’s a sham, this game right now is a joke and they have cornered a longtime player into a situation where it’s so boring  and pointless to play I’m starting to drift away and play other games. I have reached out to customer support on other matters before I have never heard back over months went by since. The DEVS should pay attention but I’m sure they are making enough scamming people into paying for this game.",Dev’s need to listen to feedback
3,2023-09-28 13:03:47,"When I first downloaded this game I was so excited because all my friends were playing and the build a car or truck with a friend was going on, plus the other everyday stuff.  So basically exciting because winning rolls, cards and having fun with a friend.  Then it was over and then NOTHING and it got boring.  I was hoping the next season was going to be better because EVERYBODY was complaining on reviews about the same stuff which is  NOT ENOUGH ROLLS,  GETTING REPEAT CARDS (so can’t complete sets),  not getting gold cards,  can’t trade gold cards do have.   PLEASE FIX all the problems and do more of the fun stuff like the car and cake competitions.  That’s all we as players are asking for because the game started strong but your failing now.

1,2023-09-22 04:21:10,"I’ve only been playing for about 3 weeks. Yesterday I HAD to do an update and I’ve been having problems since. I couldn’t play at all after the update and eventually uninstalled until I could reinstall hours later. I can finally play, but whenever I click on the icon of the coin with the M on it, the entire game basically freezes. So…..I don’t know why I’m collecting the coins and every time I try to find out the game freezes. Thanks for the good for nothing update!   1 day later: That update has totally ruined the game for me. It now sometimes just doesn’t work when I open it. I’ve just restarted the game 3 times and nothing happens when I try to roll the dice. I’m not even getting a message regarding my connection. It’s just not doing anything. Nothing on the screen will work! A few minutes later: Now that my 5 mins has expired to get the dice multiplier, everything works again. Go figure.",Idk what happened
1,2023-09-20 09:42:53,"Honest review. Game, got me and a lot of other hooked. It’s good, however it definitely PAY TO WIN. You wanna buy a 3800 dice for $100 and then save all in game money you eat for a wheel boost so you can get double the cards? Guess what? Mr. Scopely has a nice bot that comes for you and can every last thing you have! Yes that’s right, you make an in app purchase and it can basically be for nothing. You email the developer one day you get an answer of “we are working on a fix” and another day you get “there aren’t any bots” lol. After a while of playing the game you get 8 dice an hour, that get you ABSOLUTELY NO WHERE. They patched methods for you to buy dice cheap to play the game. Don’t waste your money on this app. All it is is a cash grab for the developers. Also, if you buy dice at the beginning it’s cheaper, but as you buy these greedy fools raise the price! Up to $100 for some virtual dice!!! Don’t spend your hard earned money with these fools.",Remove from App Store
2,2023-09-07 22:45:01,"When I first downloaded this game about a month or so ago, I was having fun and winning all these prizes, had plenty of dice, etc… but now they are cracking down on their greed. They lowered rewards/prizes, raised the prices for dice, lowered the friend referral amount from 100 friends (10,000 dice as reward) to 10 friends (1,000 dice reward), etc. just all in all made it waaayyy more difficult to get dice without literally buying it at inflated rates. At this point 100 rolls is gone in about 2 minutes tops, so why would I spend $9.99 on 180 rolls? Their greed makes me not even want to play. Like I’m gonna get on and roll for 5 minutes then have to get off bc I didn’t earn enough money, rolls, stickers, whatever, to even keep going, plus not have any shields (5 max 🙄) so I can be attacked, and the only way to help myself is to buy rolls. I guess they don’t call it monopoly for nothing.",Used to be fun
2,2023-07-25 08:27:42,"There’s way too many screen animations in this game. There is no tap and go. You tap… wait for the long and unnecessary animation to finish, and if you open a box with multiple prizes each prize has its own animation that occurs one at a time. Even logging in there’s at least 3 pop ups you have to get past before you can actually play or anything. I’m not sure if clicks helps with how apps are paid or funded but that’s the only angle I can see so players are on the game significantly longer than necessary. There needs to be an option to disable these long and dramatic animations at least. It shouldn’t take me 5 minutes to start enjoying the game after I open it. It takes so much away from the excitement when you get a notification your rolls are filled and can play because you have to wait for x amount of animations and pop ups to finish.",Animations WAY too long
2,2023-07-10 12:22:51,"It’s a very fun game. I spend a lot of time on it, and more money than I probably should. But I’ve had it up to my ears with the rewards system. I’ll go 5 straight railroad tiles without a bank heist; 5 or more straight color sets without a 4 star card pack; and especially during the recent Baking Partners event, I haven’t landed on the jackpot reward ONCE. Not ONCE. I won’t even bring up the community chest, and how many days I’ve opened it since I received the highest reward (Hint: It’s been a month.) The chances of good rewards are minuscule, and it’s painfully obvious it’s to drive more micro-transactions. I won’t lie that I play into it, but this game is not consumer friendly, and you should be aware of that before going in. If you want to play, you WILL have to spend money, because these developers DO NOT CARE how many spins on a wheel you make or how much time you invest, they won’t reward you for it.","Fun, but rigged."
4,2023-10-13 00:52:49,I love this game but I have found that the boards keeping getting harder and harder to get. You should get much more dice per hour like I have seen many ppl complain about and also getting the same cards over and over and making it so hard to complete the sets and don’t make the limit to trade cards higher so you can actually get a fighting chance to play this!! I’m not even gonna get on the mega heist and the rent frenzy. I like the peg game but it’s almost hideous too to the point I almost wanna stop playing the game. I’ve spent money and I get more from not spending money than to spend money!! Can you please make the game more enjoyable. You did a great job creating it and you have so many ppl playing. Please read your reviews!!!!!,The game itself!!
1,2023-06-22 09:12:25,"Excited to play initially. Even with what I found to be Limited options, ior settings to change the experience.  Even unable to partake in community chest cards unless you provide five friends.  The kicker was around purchases, first purchase went well, paid and received the goods.  Second purchase, paid, and didn’t receive the goods. Then the journey started to obtain help to get matter resolved. Only option, on-line chat. After providing details on issue, told “hang tight, we will get back to you momentarily” momentarily indicates maybe a few minutes max, no not in scopely time. In fact not response, and no longer able to send additional messages, no way to clear and restart, no ability to knock on the door for help.

I reached out several times and the bot system they use keeps malfunctioning. Asking for my email over and over.   Then I tried to play with the dice I did receive and it keeps glitching every time I get a prize or hit a railroad. Cheating me out of rewards and points in the tournament. I then reached out again. Same glitching bot response.   I know it’s a silly game and glitches happen. When you put actual money in you should expect to not be cheated.

Since I could barely participate in the events, I decided just to save my rolls for the partner events (the really fun part for me). Now, this game just went off and INCREASED the amount of points needed for each car. They increased it by not a little, but literally double! Also, when I use the wheels to roll for points, I’ve noticeably gotten no luck with points this time around. It takes more to get the cars completed AND I bet they made it harder to even get the points. If you want the extra rolls to even try to complete this, better get ready to spend like $200! I had 8,000 rolls and would have normally completed this partner event. Now I’m almost out and have nothing to show for it. I’m about to quit this game, and I hope all others do too.

This toys competition has been fun. I have been a able to keep up better. Still no new stickers and I have photo evidence of that but I am actually kind of enjoying the game again. I know you want people to by packs but it is a free game. Help the people out who don’t spend a bunch of money.  Let us trade golds once a month or something for the 3 months that we have the album.

We have all Spent hundred of dollars and me personally, I could have made a house note with how much money I have spent. It is sad that Scopely has gotten so greedy with their loyal players and so many of us are going to stop playing this game. It is a shame. I will go to Coin Master and Other games that isn’t so expensive to play. I don’t t mind paying at all and have spent money on all my other games also but MonopolyGO has gotten too expensive to play when you get on 250 boards and higher and don’t get enough dice rolls to do any good.

Also the 3 pop ups after you run out of rolls is so unnecessary and annoying. Other than that it’s a great time waste.  Been playing daily for awhile now and the amount of money I’ve put in I should have been able to get all the stickers by now. Not everyone has social media so if there was a way to trade in game it would be very appreciated by those of us who drop money in game. I have been stuck for weeks getting the same 5 star stickers over and over and I can’t do anything about it.

This is a 100% pay to play game, but I refuse to spend any money on it. Also, the scammers need to be cracked down on in the Facebook group. People are literally SELLING the stickers on Facebook, eBay, and Etsy. I’m pretty sure that’s illegal. I am not paying someone for a sticker when someone else could gift it to me for free.  On another note, for the challenges and mini game prizes, most of us want MORE DICE at a LOWER COST.

Seems they adjust the odds on the sticker collecting before the album event ending so you have to buy pack and rolls into have a SMALL CHANCE to get what you need. Be careful when downloading, don’t let the hype of 15,000 rolls get you hooked. There is little to no pay off for free to play players. You get stomped by the people with high multipliers and sticker trading is a huge hassle. They designed the game nicely to funnel people into thinking they NEED to buy these things and charge differently based on what they think they can make you pay. Packs for the same stickers cost significantly more for some players.   TL;DR: it’s a predatory gacha game with no pay off other than getting stuck in their game cycle.

1,2023-08-13 13:31:34,"My family and extended family ( over 40 members ) have been playing for the last month. This morning, my wife tried to play and a payment verification notification popped up.

She ended up deleting the app after entering my card information and it still wasn’t working. 5. She redownloaded the app. It turned on. The app said it found her account but then will shutdown immediately after.  Now……, The sad part is that both myself and my wife have been trying to contact Scopely to inform them and to try to get a resolution as to why this is happening and why is the app trying to make a payment verification when no one tried to make a purchase. Guess what? No direct contact to them. Ask for help and it sends you to a chatbot that won’t go further unless you include you in-game user id. Can’t get to that, unless YOU ARE ABLE TO GET INTO THE GAME!!! No phone number, no email address to contact and no real interaction with a real person. Very disappointing.

You should not be allowed to get more than one gold card if you cannot trade them in my opinion. I enjoy the game because I play it every day but it is getting very repetitive and frustrating not being able to receive any new card in the card packs. It’s only old cards that you already have. I feel like the multiplier should change the cards that you are able to get the higher the multiplier, the more rare cards you get the lower the multiplier, the more common cards do you get. after you reach a certain stage, I feel like the rare Karch should come more often.

The scamming on this game by players, is shameful. Scopely has done nothing to prevent this. Since the new stickers/Albums now all albums require a gold sticker, which is almost next to impossible to obtain. When you purchase the packages, they are useless, same stickers over and over. During certain tournaments, tasks are impossible to complete with the amount of dice that regenerate. They have taken the fun out of the game and are just interested in grabbing our money!

2,2023-09-25 11:20:38,At the beginning this game is pretty fun. You get to go do heists and shut down properties of friends. They have mini events which are both good and not so good. The rewards as you get higher level do not keep up with the cost of upgrading properties. You pay more to get out of jail then you get when you pass go. The stickers you need to complete a pack is almost impossible to do since the new theme released. It is almost impossible to complete the game goals with out having to pay for it.   I think if the devs could at least make the stickers not be so repetitive and some of the mini games a little easier to achieve then it would have higher star rating. Over all the interacting with friends and family is fun. The board themes are cute. Just don’t get your hopes up on completing many of the mini games/card sets with out paying for it.,Pay to play

There is somewhat of a learning curve that is not easily met just because you know the old game. HOWEVER, having said that I’d Ike to say that this game is enjoyable. It has likable features. It is playable and enjoyable. I don’t like the fact that you have to either make a purchase or wait an hour in order to continue playing. The end of the game is not in sight. Hmm!? One of the things to know that this is now, like other internet games, an apparently never-ending game. You just keep going up another level. There is no winning or losing. So it sort of depends on whether you want a game that starts and ends with a clear winner and loser or want a game that ranks everyone and keeps going.

1,2023-08-16 22:30:00,"Okay I’ll admit, when I first got this game I did spend money on rolls. I would win a lot of challenges, place 1st-3rd, win a lot of rolls by just rolling x3 for 150 rolls at a time. The challenges are fun but you can just see such a difference on so many things man. Yesterday, I had 600 rolls, one of my things was to land on a utility tile so of course I’m rolling x5 just to have a better chance of finishing it quicker. I used almost 350 rolls and hadn’t landed on it not once .. nothing I hit NOTHING (mind you, the 600 rolls I had was earned over a few days, not bought) I go to x1 and hit it immediately .. which gave me almost nothing. Coincidence? Maybe. I don’t think it is. Now, Not only have I not gotten any new stickers in almost a month and a half, but I have also been refusing to buy rolls. The duplicate stickers are insane.

My dice rolls do not match the moves that are made. My game glitches, sometimes to the point that if I land on a railroad it will close out the game and put me back at GO!

When it is supposed to be mega heist half the time it doesn’t even work and you get a regular one. When I downloaded the app and signed up for this game I didn’t realize until after spending almost $600 that the account somehow connected to someone else’s account not my own new account.

I just confirmed that I rolled a 10 but it only moved 8 spaces. I also feel like we get entirely to many stickers we don’t need, and we should be able to share a least one gold sticker a day, week or something. What’s the point of have multiple if you can’t gift them? I mean if we getting multiple of them we should at least be able to trade them for one that we need. Oh and I feel like there should always be something utilizing the free space, I’m sure there are some other things that can be fixed but church has started so I have to go.

2,2023-11-01 18:49:31,I’m not typically a fan of games but I became obsessed with this one quickly. It started out fun but now it seems to have become all about money. I play EVERYDAY and have never completed a collection of cards and those who have bought some. I usually win the competitions each competition becomes more challenging and requires more making it almost impossible to complete without spending money. You should be able to play the game and accomplish things without paying ridiculous amounts for dice and cards. Also during the competitions no matter what I play on the game keeps landing on nothing higher than 300. Today is the last day of the competition and my app glitched all more. I’m honestly at a point where I think it’s probably best I just uninstall. So many of my friends have or have stopped playing consistently for these same reasons.,Uninstall
4,2023-07-27 03:02:58,"I love this game. It’s addictive, low pressure, and fun. However, the stinginess of the creatures in terms of dice, money, and stickers is very disappointing. At first I didn’t mind sir ding a little money to win more…but the rewards for completing a board should really increase as you progress, and the simple fact that EVERYONE is looking for the same stickers makes it feel like the plan is to make getting them next to impossible, abd certainly not without spending $$. My only other issue is that the number in the dice and the number of spaces the token moves often don’t match. And it seems like it usually happens when I’m in need of a certain place to land to win something. It’s starting to make the game less fun. Which makes me sad.",So fun and so frustrating

Last time was within the top 15, so not too big of a deal. I figured at 2nd place I would definitely get my prize, right? Wrong. I have the same amount of die I did ten minutes ago before it ended, even restarted the game twice after it timed out, and nothing. No prize, again. No pop up for the leaderboard win. I always get smaller prizes below top fifteen with NO ISSUE! The die I wasted to get to that point won’t be returned in any meaningful way, and I frankly don’t feel like playing anymore. It’s just a waste of time and it’s becoming outright stressful. I even have a photo of twenty minutes before the end, when I had enough points that I couldn’t have even sunk to 4th place.

3,2023-09-23 19:02:12,"I love this game for the most part but it has gotten way old constantly getting the same gold stickers over and over versus new ones and the game making it so hard to get 5 star stickers too. If you guys are doing it this way to force people to pay money for everything in the game that's not fair. Surely you guys make enough off it already that you can at least make the game a little easier on everyone who plays it... Making it easier to get dice would be nice as well, and letting us have more than 5 trades a day. The cake competitions could be a bit easier to complete also.  You guys have made it impossible to enjoy the game because we have to either wait forever for what we need to play it or pay extra money just to get ahead in the game.",Give us new gold stickers!!
2,2023-06-11 21:55:55,"Every time the game is opened 5 pop ups, pop up every time dice gets to 1 or none a pop up shows up, less pop ups update is a lie, seems the creators are desperately trying to get money from you. The original game you bought once and played as long as you kept the board. Always a offer that the money to packages (or resupplies/supplies) ratio is always off, considering what you just bought could last 5 minutes and not more than a couple weeks at most. All the pop ups ask for money. All the pop ups come at specific times designed to make you pay for play. Most of the events cannot be completed without spending money, so in reality your buying the free event reward. As I said typical desperate for money tactics. Needs to be a way you can speed up animation or shut it off entirely, Maybe they’ll make you pay for that option.",Less pop ups?
1,2023-10-21 20:29:47,"When I first downloaded the app, I was really happy and I did spend some actual $$ on packages for dice, cards etc. I’ve noticed so many times that tournaments will promise new stickers for your ranking, and when I’ve won that ranking, there isn’t any new cards and sometimes even level 4 packages only gave 3 star cards. I also saved up enough for the huge sticker/dice vault expecting to get 2-3 new cards as advertised and a gold, yet when I cashed it in, I only got 1 new card. I’ve rolled so many times with dice that should’ve landed on a railroad or a tile that has extra points on it for events and then the actual moves the game moves my piece doesn’t match the dice roll. If the game gave packages that had new items in it, would be consistent with dice rolls, and was more consistent then it would deserve 5 stars. I’ve spent way too much money on the game to have gotten as little as I have and it’s disappointing.",Disappointing.
5,2023-08-27 01:11:54,Just downloaded this. Seems like it’s nice. I’ve enjoyed it. Only thing I’ve seen is unless you win the extra dice witch you can do if run out takes a good while to get 5 more back. Other then that I think I’m really going to enjoy the game. I have to play it the free way so I have to wait. When you get to where you’re almost out of dice it will pop up with where you can buy dice. Wish that wouldn’t happen each time but it is very fun. It’s worth downloading it. I’m sure a lot of people might want to buy the extra if was able to. Love the no ads. So from what I’ve seen as of yet I’m glad I tried it. Do wish wouldn’t have to wait as long for just 5 dice. Worth the 5 stars.,Enjoy
3,2023-09-20 03:53:55,"So I did love the game but of course since everyone is playing now and the makers see they can make a lot of money, they made the game harder to move up and to attain the challenges without actually purchasing something. The game is very addictive but who actually want to wait 1 hour for 8 dice. I used to stay on this game all day and even purchase but now, I may play once or twice a day. Then the trading cards are ridiculous, why keep giving the same card over and over again when there is other cards needed with the same stars. Make it so bad, they have a group for the game so you can trade with other players but it is like an auction in there. They want to take all you have just to get one card. So now I’m like it is what it is and if I get it fine and if I don’t then oh well.",Once Loved
1,2023-09-10 14:02:36,"Forgot to mention on top of not getting the earned rewards, the game has changed the amount of rewards you get for finishing albums by almost half. Also you now need a gold sticker for every album( gold stickers can only be rewarded by the game, a family or friend can not gift you or trade you one) making it way more difficult to complete albums. They really want you to spend money to really enjoy the game is the best way I can put it without going into details you may not understand if you’ve never played. If you don’t mind spending money and by money I mean 100s of dollars on a game then go for it. Monopoly should just do a monthly subscription at this point if it’s about the money. I would rather pay that instead Of 100s a month. I’m really so annoyed because I loved this game. Best game out in a while until y’all ruined it by making it more difficult for players to enjoy the game",To add to my previous review

It is so fun to play with family, and friends and even make friends with anyone anywhere, but I will say having to wait for rolls was annoying and whenever I was out of rolls it would be 45 minutes I had to wait just for about 5 lousy rolls and the amount of pop us was a little bit crazy because it would want me to pay and I personally don’t like spending money on games so I exit out of it with about three more pop ups about deals and buying it showing up every time I was out of rolls no hate I understand they are trying to make money I still would recommend 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️❤️❤️!!",Obsessed!!❤️❤️
1,2023-08-23 22:32:49,"I can’t think of a more fitting way to use the Monopoly name and image than this mindless treadmill of an experience.  The game loop boils down to the purest form of rat brain psychology I have ever seen in a mobile app.  Push the big red button to roll your dice, which are a limited resource, and receive randomized prizes or penalties in the form of monopoly money or more dice.  When you run out of dice, multiple microtransaction options will be forced onto your screen urging you to purchase more dice.  This is a brilliant deconstruction of the original board game, and is just as if not slightly more engaging than classics such as cookie clicker or spinning around in your moms office chair.  I just know that that this product makes more money in an hour than I’ll probably see in the next decade.  It gives me hope that I too may one day take advantage of people’s vulnerability to addictive cycles and make millions of my own.  Life is a lie, art is dead, hail Sithis.",Perfection

Also, when running out of rolls you have to press X for 3 different things trying to get you to use real money to buy more rolls. If I wanted to buy rolls, I’d know where to find the shop to buy more. It doesn’t need to pop up every time. It is fun and exciting at times but waiting for rolls take forever.

4,2023-07-24 23:15:26,"I LOVE THIS GAME!! It manages to keep players interested and can give u many good deals, but still challenging so that u will keep trying to beat competition and yourself. The social aspect of it is also great… HOWEVER the sticker trading aspect is genius and one of the best ways to earn dice except for the fact that YOU CANT TRADE GOLD STICKERS!!! You can’t trade gold stickers which is just what most people need as the progress through the game, and the worst part is YOU CAN EARN EXTRA GOLD STICKERS EVEN THOUGH U CANT TRADE THEM. Now if you really don’t want to change the whole game, then make gold stickers able to be traded one of the competitions/ challenges and if u don’t, at least take away the ability to collect extra.

1,2023-06-16 16:59:27,Ive been playing for a little while I did like the game at first but honestly the Balancing issues it has just arent worth playing the game. You are basically never gonna have any decent amount of rolls unless you complete the challenges but the game will make sure you run of rolls before that happens I got up to about 800 Net worth and just started to realize how rigged this game is. You can do some things for rolls but its basically pay to win. Constant Pop Up ads about spending money every 3 seconds I have muscle memory built for when I load the game to quickly close the ads. Horrible game. I liked it at first but im sick and tired of this game and this Greedy company they are the same as all the rest.

This is especially frustrating because I still need over 20 stickers to complete the whole sticker set. Having to wait 10 hours for a full set of rolls is just silly. The only way to get ahead in rolls is to win tournaments or events, and the only way to do that is spend money on rolls.

I’ve reached out to customer support on multiple occasions to #1 let them know this was happening, and number 2 to request my money back! With nothing more than basically I can’t help you.

I hate that you only get 50 dice per board completion. We have to pay more money per board so the dice should be mor as we get a long further. I also hate that some of the events like the 2&3 day ones take way more points now than before. It already takes me 8 hours to get 80 dice how am I going to complete the event if I only get 240 a day. Y’all are very limiting and making this game excessively boring. You guys push purchases on us but they aren’t even worth it bc if you spend money you still don’t complete the events. You can roll your heart out and it still won’t land where you need it to.

And when they show that I’ve been bank heist from them, they never seem to take all my money when it says they have. For instance, one of my friends bank heist 200Mil from me, my page only showed he took 10 mill. I don’t know if the multiplier had anything to do with it. Also, another random account that I’m not friends with stole 298mil in a bank heists. All of the random accounts I don’t know always take all my money if I don’t play the game for a few days.

5,2023-06-26 20:39:18,Loving the game as I am not a gamer or play any games for that matter. My husband and I play together with some friends and are enjoying it. I do have a few recommendations for the developers to consider. Maybe they have already but figured I will give it a go.   When new trading albums start incorporate additional trades onto the spinning wheel. Makes it fun to help out others.   Don’t allow the programming and software to give you more than one gold card/special cards (only allow just one). Not doing you really any good to have extras of those if you can’t trade them. Yes increases your stars but you get plenty of others to fill that void!  Just a waste if you ask me.,Love it but have Recommendations
3,2023-07-26 01:35:03,"This game has the potential to be so much fun and get lost in for some time. The problem is the lack of rolls. The amount of dice you get after an hour allows for like 30 seconds of play. I am sure the developers are trying to get cash out of their players, but not everyone has a budget to play. Many of us would play this exclusively if we could play longer, but the limited amount of rolls given reduce the playing time.  The sticker trading on FB is ridiculous. SO MANY SCAMMERS! Also, trying to get stickers is impossible. If you so happen to get higher level stickers, it’s always duplicates of gold cards which can’t be traded.   Really could be an amazing game, but finding it harder to want to play when the developers limit a person to playing 30 seconds per hour.",Could be better
1,2023-07-20 22:01:18,Omg just when ingame support starts to show compassion for the issues the game is suffering and actually doing something about it. You get a bad egg in the support group that messes it up for the rest of the group to make situations worse. I have completed the Album but yet the rewards don’t reset so you have to go thru and take pics send in tickets to take a day or so for a response to get your rewards. Mind you make sure it’s the right amount since when you complete sec time it’s supposed to be more see others that are not suffering from the isssue. Point being it’s an on going issue the techs are trying to fix but have not yet. We all understand issues come about but don’t act as if we are all stupid. Jimci makes situation worse by saying the issue has been resolved closes out your ticket give you no rewards that you have earned and also lies saying he sent you gift (also lie).,Jimci with in game support.

I was wrong but in the best way. This game is definitely addictive and will have anyone checking on their board even if they don’t have any dice left. Lol only thing I wish there was a period we could trade golden stickers or allow us to trade them at the expense you can’t trade with that person for 24-48 hours.

I would be willing to spend money but not if it’s just going to make the game harder in a couple days. It could be so much more fun with the simple addition of more dice an hour. Also, the competition should be people in similar levels, no way normal players can compete with the ones getting first place. You can put a level 1000 against a level 8000 and expect good results.

But it’s based off of completing each map (upgrading each building allows you to advance to the next map).  Minus a star for a different feel from what I was expecting.   Secondly, the multiplier has a slight flaw. I used to roll x10 when I had lots of extra rolls. But at times when landing on the shield (it’s supposed to reimburse you for a free roll), it would give me 1 roll back instead of the 10 I used for the attempt. Which makes me use x2 instead even when I have 300+ rolls to use, that way it doesn’t hurt as much when the system rips me off.  All in all, it’s fun.. but the repetitiveness can make it lack luster after a while of playing.","Fun BUT,"
3,2023-09-11 19:55:38,Don’t download unless you want to end up in monopoholic anonymous. Game is extremely addicting but gets disappointing once you reach a certain level . 8 dice a hour is ridiculous considering to even get anything you need a multiplayer of at least five . Game is completely rigged . Expect major frustration and anxiety . You’ll get dice withdrawals and start debating about buying dice . DONT BUY DICE 10 dollars for 200 dice is a complete scam . You’ll spend hours refreshing and pleading in facebook trading groups for the cards monopoly refuses to give you . Once you reach a high level ( I’m at 4k ) building landmarks becomes difficult because by the time you gather a billion dollars for one landmark upgrade someone has already stolen the money . I’m still going to play this game but just be warned 😭😭😭,Monopoholics anonymous
1,2023-10-29 07:30:24,"This game is a huge disappointment.  When the game was first released it was not perfect but it was a very fun and exciting game. It could even be argued that it was one of the best mobile gaming experiences in a very long time since it presented a fresh take on mobile gaming whilst promoting community spirit.  Unfortunately for players, the developers are more concerned with players spending real money to obtain dice and prizes or to advance rather than to improve on player experience and enjoyment.  The developers continue to make very poor design choices which quite literally spit in the faces of players. Examples being the increased difficulty to complete sticker albums AND the decreased number of dice awarded for completing said albums, another such example would be the length of time it takes for dice to be generated still being capped at 8 dice per hour with a maximum capacity of 80 given how quickly they are used.   What proved to me that Scopely does not care about player experience is the fact that in the most recent Halloween event, they have increased the number of points by 20k (some players were already struggling to complete the required 60k) but have not proportionally increased the prizes awarded.  If Scopely continues to operate in this manner it may not be too long before more people are fed up and stop playing.",Disappointed
1,2023-09-24 18:49:26,"It’s fun in the beginning. Then, of course, you will need to pay real money if you want to achieve things. There are scammers and bots within the game that make it impossible for you to win in certain events. Monopoly go stickers are a joke. You constantly get same ones on repeat no matter what you do. You get gold on repeat and can’t even exchange them. Waste!!!! Many people are fed up with it and have decided to not play any longer or they will just randomly play. The more you advance the more stuff cost, yet, you get same amount of dice. The rolls are generated basically. You try to do things and have to land on certain things but you will waste all of your dice trying. Thus,  needing to buy more or wait an hour for around 8 dice. I wouldn’t recommend trying to get ahead or get things because in the end you just lose more than you win.",You lose more than you win. Don’t fall for the scam
3,2023-07-11 03:27:16,"I’ve had the game since June 25, 2023. The game is great and enjoyable, minus the little bugs that it had during the new update. But, that was understandable. However, on July 8, I had an issue reconnecting to my account after my iPad restored and updated. My account is backed up with Apple, but I can’t seem to access it. As soon as I opened the app, it immediately started as a new account and wouldn’t let me do anything without finishing the tutorial. After I finished, I tried looking for an option to reconnect, but only found an option to disconnect with Apple??? In addition, I’ve tried reaching out to Customer Service and never got a reply. Please help, I really don’t want to start over. In fact, I see no point in doing so and if I’m not able to reconnect I’ll just say goodbye to the app.",Technical Issue
2,2023-09-10 23:14:05,I have gripes. The new update stickers and cake event have been an absolute disappointment since the first days. I was so excited . The first few days I was rolling and rolling until this glitch started happening where my money and dice disappeared it happened at least three times and I thought it would reset and it didn’t it didn’t give me back my money or dice. Then when the cake game out since the beginning I would sometimes land on the cookies and revived nothing I would literally start at the numbers . I’d have to say I’m owed far more than the 400 cookies they gave out today. The vanishing dice and coookies is upsetting because me and my friends really enjoyed this game and now we have all started losing interest in it .before I was willing two throw a lil bit of cash at the game now I don’t feel it is worth it at all .,I use to enjoy the game
1,2023-08-13 05:01:19,"I’ve spent money on this game. But I’ve come to realize that no matter what you do each challenge has the ratio of landing on a tile changes per challenge to prevent you from completing it and trying to force you to spend money. For instance, you have to land on one of the corner squares to get wheels in order to complete a partner challenge. Before this challenge was started I would land on a corner square frequently, but after the challenge started I’m lucky to ever land on one. Funny thing is before this challenge you had to land on railroads, I could barley land on them before, but load and behold, I’m landing on them constantly now. This game is rigged and I’d advise anyone to not download it. Between the stickers, the challenges, and the tournament’s, this game will try to con you to break your bank account. So frustrating…oh and don’t even try to contact customer support…nothing is their problem and they always blame your ISP.",Money Con

3,2023-05-23 07:34:07,So I absolutely love this game and the idea of it. I truly love it and the amount of things you can do is limited but it never gets boring. The only problem I have is whenever you run out of rolls or load onto the game it spams you with advertisements (the advertisements that cost money for the game) but overall it’s a really great game and I mean it. If your just getting this game I bet you’ll love it. There are a few things you could add like you have to pay rent for other people too because it’s just annoying having so much money because of just spamming GO and landing in the spot where people pay you rent. And maybe you can like change your avatar and name but maybe it’s just me who doesn’t know how to do that… but so far I love playing this game and you should definitely get it.,good but one thing…

The daily treats shouldnt re-start if you sign in and play everyday then why can’t we keep getting more and more dice for every consecutive day!? It’s a game and a lot of apps are like this now…..I sign on daily and I get asked to buy dice or money no lie 30 times a day!! I know I can buy dice if I want to but there should also be a way to participate without spending money everyday! Thanks.",Please give us more free play
2,2023-11-08 15:11:11,"I love this game and spend money on it, however thinking about quitting because too much needs to be fixed. The amount you charge for dice. Then the packs are not a guaranteed card you need so your just pretty much spending $100 for cards you already have and a small amount of dice 3,000 which isn’t enough for what this game demands! Then what’s the point of a trading group if it’s full of scammers that take your card and won’t send back so some type of platform HAS TO be created to trade at the same time! The tournaments have to be rigged because there’s no way someone has 24,000 points in the first 5 mins of tournament starting! I can go on but those are the main things that irritate me and everyone else! I don’t plan on spending another $100 til attempts are made to fix these things especially the scamming!",Too much needs fixing
3,2023-11-02 12:53:26,This board game has the potential to be an even greater game however there’s many obstacles in the way. After spending BILLIONS of dollars to complete each board you only receive 50 dice? That’s ridiculous! The wait  time for only 8 dice is too extensive and makes you not even want to continue playing the game. Then there’s the fact that their are options of buying more dice rolls but the cost for it it’s not even worth it. Maybe monopoly has changed since I played the actual board game because I always thought if and when you roll a double you get another chance to roll again! Why would the game allow you to roll double but still take a way the roll? It’s ridiculous and this game has the potential to be a great game,Has potential to be a great game
5,2023-08-31 00:39:44,"It’s a great game, but it could be better.  If money goes up with each board then so should the dice you get.  If we can’t trade our gold stickers then stop giving us dupes of the same ones over and over again since they’re so “rare”. I shouldn’t have 5 of the same gold stickers and not be able to get the other ones. That’s literally insane.  Also the trading of stickers could be better if you made an actual system made just for it instead of a Facebook group full of people who want real money for these stickers or an insane amount of stickers for one 5 star sticker. You guys could definitely be doing better.",Could Definitely be better.
4,2023-10-30 14:13:11,"When I started the game 4+ months ago it was great. You were able to receive stickers to complete sets with ease, even able to complete co-op challenges and daily/weekly challenges. Now all you get are the same stickers, save up to do trade ins to receive “new” stickers and get the same ones you just traded. On campaigns you spend all your dice to get next to nothing on specialty items to roll for the challenges. On challenges you can attempt to use the multiplier but still end up with the lowest possible outcome. It’s like you’re trying to force the player to spend more money then they may have spent on the game. Feels like complete entrapment from the game server. Game has become unpleasant to try and play.",Great Game but……

I've been informed about a distinctly noticeable improvement in regards to my attitude, my demeanor, my performance, and my energy levels as well!  I'm a great deal more tolerant of things requiring a lot of patience and attention allowing me to focus a bit easier and not feel overwhelmed with anxiety and depression or fatigue and restlessness.  In the roughly 2 weeks I've been playing this game; I’ve almost made it to board 30, I have collected 300+ milestones, and completed numerous sticker albums.  Also, another thing I really enjoy are some of the mini games hidden in different areas on your board. My absolute favorite game feature is hands down, The Dice Multiplier! I've been lucky enough to experience the multiplier saving my whole turn and some days it's even turned my actual bad day completely around!

There are some things that don’t make sense to me though and that’s why I gave it 4 stars. For starters, why aren’t the gold allowed to be traded. Why on earth do I need 4 of the same gold sticker?? I have friends that need them and I can’t help.  The sticker algorithm is totally messed up. I went 5 days without a single new sticker. Not even a 1 star one. That’s totally unacceptable. I’m a hardcore gamer and I do spend money on games I enjoy playing but I haven’t bought lately cause it’s been a drag to play lately. Yall did such a great job making an addicting game but there’s things that need fixing. Thanks..",Completely enjoyable (sometimes)

For me, it just... disappears. When closing out of the mini game, and all of the awards won is displayed, it doesn’t show up on there, either.

The part that was worth grinding on the game was getting a lot of dice for each album completed. So on the next season, you add more stickers that are harder to get and lessen the dice we get for completing the albums? At this point in the season I need 29 more stickers and a every single one is a gold and 4 or 5 star sticker. It’s taken all of the fun out of the game because it’s already hard enough to get a single 4 or 5 star within a week.

1,2023-09-18 15:34:58,This game starts out fun. They make it easy to level up but that’s as far as it goes. Getting Dive on a consistent basis is hard. The sticker book collection is a joke. The number of duplicate stickers and duplicate Gold stickers is laughable!! The wheel you spin for completing a property set is also a joke!! I’ve spun that thing 10 times in a row and received the same reward 5 times in a row. Which was a garbage 1 star sticker pack that gives you crap!!! Even if you spend money on this game you will never finish a sticker album. The devs have bots to randomly Heist your bank in large amounts. Don’t wast your time with this game unless you have endless amounts of money to literally burn! Players have complained and given endless opportunities to fix the game.

The game freezes or glitches a lot too. As for the partner ones it’s fun but it’s 20 per spin and you don’t even get that many unless you times your rolls by like 20.

You need billions to complete a board on level 200 but still get the same 50 dice. 8 dice per hour is worthless when your past level 100 and have to work so hard to complete a board. Lastly the unfair requirements to complete a task. Example 400 dice reward in the paddle task. One player needs 750 paddles while another player needs 800 paddles for the same 400 dice.

Waiting a whole HOUR just for 6-7 dice is insane to me. 2. Why do we have to attack our friends instead of people we are not friends with? I don’t think that was a good idea. 3. It is impossible to get the actual cards that you need you get so many duplicates of what you already have and don’t need to finish the sets. 4. I think it should be a limit to how many times a person can attack you in a day. If this gets changed then I will keep the game but otherwise I’m thinking of just deleting it.,Changes

Prepare to pay hundreds to accomplish the larger goals like collecting all the stickers. I’ve spent lots trying to get gold stickers and usually it’s just a duplicate. It’s hard to get stickers when you get near the end. It’s literally impossible to win without spending a lot of money.   If you just want to play for no prize at all then you can play for free.

The only way to get a lot of spins is to collect stickers to complete an album or to win a tournament. It’s almost impossible to even get new stickers! They will give u duplicates of all the cards u already have. They give you the option to trade in duplicate stickers but they just end up giving u a bunch more duplicates instead of new ones. The tournaments are almost impossible to even win because u NEVER HAVE ROLLS. You can’t earn anything and win when u never get to play.

Is that when you land on the tiles that have either the cookies or the drop thingys sometimes it doesn’t add them. I landed on different squares and my total stayed the same for 3 turns. So I could have had more cookies to play with. Also, I think the dice should regenerate faster. We keep leveling up on boards but they also only give us 50 dice each time.

It’s tough enough to collect unique stickers to complete albums. The developers even advertise the trading Facebook group so we can help each other complete our albums. Then it comes at our own risk, so the devs don’t offer a safe option for trading. I’ve come across some honest folks and only one dishonest person thus far.

The trading cards are frustrating because you hardly ever get a new card. And the shield… how do you get new ones to fill the slots?

It’s unfortunate that this happened, as 4 & 5 star cards are very difficult to come by, and I’ve now lost out on two of them because of the crash. Still a 5 star game, but I expect more, and if the game keeps crashing and causing me to lose out on event gifts and new cards, my review will be updated to reflect my frustration with the inconsistencies of the game.","Great Game/time filler, but keeps crashing"
2,2023-09-10 02:20:27,"This game is super fun and addicting to the point of linking up with huge groups to initiate trades and partners for the cars and cakes but once you get to level 160 and up it’s impossible to earn enough dice to even get to play. I haven’t been able to participate with my cake competition with my partners because every time I roll dice I don’t land on anything helpful to progress… I even dropped $40 for a package of over 1000 dice and 6pk of stickers just to get no new stickers, and run through all those dice with barely getting any railroads or cookies to do the cake building. I can barely complete my daily tasks at this point. There’s really no point for me to play anymore at level 169 because I can’t afford to continue paying $100s of dollars a month just to play a game… I’ll go back to playing Pokémon Go with the family instead.",Have fun while it lasts
3,2023-09-08 19:08:35,"I really love the game and how it works by going up in levels beating your friends and Destroying there landmarks. But there is 2 things from my perspective that need to change. The events I love everything but mostly the prize but then for example there’s a event with the Corners of the board and it gets hard to land on them but afterwards when the event ends and no longer needs to land on the corners it lands consistently on the corners, And As you get higher in levels, the dice in the wheel that you get from the propertys ain’t enough and it takes a while to get out of that certain landmark, And I don’t get enough dice because I have to spin at 20 or 50 times and it runs out quick because it does low rolls like 3 or 2 but those are really the only two problems I have.",Monopoly
1,2023-09-06 15:24:07,"The more levels you complete the harder it becomes to complete levels and the dice payout remains unchanged. The cost of landing on jail goes up exponentially also. Getting 8 dice maximum per hour prevents you from completing anything. But you can wait for 8 hours for the free gift to regenerate and get up to 30 dices wooo hoooo. There is no actual skill to this game, it’s more of an issue of how much money you want to spend to accomplish anything. You open Card packs and get multiple duplicates but you can’t trade gold cards and getting those is completely impossible The game glitches and you may or may not get the things that you win in the game. Customer support is slow to respond to any issues, most of the time it takes the almost a week to address your issue. The game was fun in the beginning, but quickly became kind of a nemesis that you don’t want to beat you ☹️",Don’t complete levels
2,2023-09-04 16:16:26,"This is truly the most horribly addicting game I’ve ever played. It’s so much fun with so many prizes to look forward to, but after the last update with the new album, it just became so money hungry. It’s impossible to get dice without spending actual money, and you can really only accumulate more dice if you already have plenty of dice to begin with. The “random” algorithms make it nearly impossible to finish your sticker sets, and I can’t tell you how many times in a row (6!!!) I’ve landed on a railroad and played Shut Down, with not a single Bank Heist to be seen. I don’t know why everything became harder and more expensive to accomplish, but dice payouts went down. I get that the app wants to make money, but I’m afraid you’ll be losing out on a good amount of players because it’s just not plausible to play for free anymore. Sad day.",Loved this game but now…
2,2023-08-28 19:26:01,"This game use to be fun but not anymore. I guess with the popularity the creators lost sight. There is no reason why people should continue to get dupes when they actually pay for card packages!! If i spend $99, there’s NO reason i shouldn’t get the cards that i need!! I feel like the creators are so money hungry that all the fun had been taken away!! We should be allowed to trade gold cards as well. At least during the last week of the tournament!! In spite of the INSANE amount of money I’ve spent on this game, i continue to play because of the INSANE amount of money I’ve spent!! Hopefully once the new tournament begins this week, there will be better changes ie more dice given after completing a level, being able to trade gold cards and getting more needed cards versus so many ridiculous dupes and being able to trade more than 5!",Ridiculous
5,2023-08-16 14:24:01,"I love the idea of the albums and getting rewards for playing more and completing the sets. The trading is great… I thought, until you start to get scammed. I would love for them to have either a screen where it shows what each player is offering to trade and each end has to accept the offer, or do away with the trading all together and do trading up. 50 1 stars gets you three 2 star cards, 35 2 star get you 4 3 stars. Something like that, the trading is making a community of stingy and toxic scammers. Love the game. Think it could be worked a little better. I truly wish a developer team would pick me up for some ideas",Feelings on albums and packs
1,2023-10-19 18:27:31,Aside from the game having it’s issues of not registering progress in tournaments all the time and the inconsistency of rewards across players in the same tournament the worst part about the game is the customer support and/or lack there of.  Every game has it’s issues one can come to expect that. However when an issue arises a player should be able to contact customer support to resolve the issue and attempt to recover what may have been lost. The customer support in this game however is basically all automated with no communication from an actual representative. Thus you are left with the same message of wait and see and told to add an email to be contacted only never to be contacted.   Overall poor game that I would not recommend only due to the issues with customer support not willing to fix the issues that come with their game.,Game issues and bad customer support
1,2023-10-17 03:03:57,"I started playing over a month ago and ran into a bug where the game gets soft locked upon earning your first house in the tutorial. The game asks me to return to my board to place the house, but I cannot click on anything at all, making it impossible to return to the board. Because I’m unable to click on anything, I am unable to submit an official bug report as it requires opening the menu and getting your unique player ID. This is unacceptable. I’ve tried restarting my phone and even completely reinstalling the game and restarting from the beginning of the tutorial. Nothing works. Developers probably don’t care that they’re missing out on any new players because their existing players make them more than enough money. Why fix a problem if it doesn’t affect your veteran player base, right? 🙄","Unfixed, game breaking bug has left the game unplayable for new players"
4,2023-10-15 04:41:32,"I love the game it’s soooooo fun, but we don’t win a whole lot of dice like the cash we receive and the duplicate stickers. It would be nice to have a dice drop like the cash drop. Why does the app give you sooooo many duplicates of the same stickers. I haven’t received a new sticker in weeeeks!! 🥺 I love love looooove the side game of wheels and building the cars and the robot with the tokens!! Hope there will be some more exciting side games like those. And I hope you keep running the build the cars and robot 🤗 I also want to add….I have so many friends why do I get the same people in the money heists and on my board?

3,2023-10-13 00:11:41,As much as I absolutely love playing this game. I have to give 3 stars. I know at some point I will just delete it. The events are where you get the good cards and more dice but you have to spend more dice then you win just to actually win and the price of the dice is absolutely ridiculous. 10/10 on the spin when you complete a color set you are getting duplicate yellow pack always. They should take these stickers away once have all of them or add the better packs on the spin wheel. I don’t need 50 of the same ones. The events are fun but it is unrealistic for a normal person even when spending money to get 6.5k chips or whatever is needed on the last task just to get 6.5 dice and card pack ❤️Trading is fun tho and the game is fun to play.,Game Play/dice and stickers/events
2,2023-09-25 20:03:26,The difficulty level to get the gold stickers is ridiculous. Also the only 50 dice for cleaning boards is crazy. Why is a person on level 35 getting same amount of dice for someone on level 200???? There needs to be changes to this app. And the fact you can’t trade the gold stickers is horrible. Why let me get extra if I can’t trade the gold ones???  If these simple changes are made folks will keep interest in the game and will continue to play. Don’t ignore this review. Please don’t. A lot of folks are saying the same about this. This monopoly go has the potential to be as great as NBA 2K or Madden.   Make these changes and keep this game alive. Please!!! Hire me to the team. I can help but keep it profitable for you all as well. People will spend their own money if it’s fun. They don’t all the time on NBA 2K for virtual currency.,Needs Improvement
1,2023-08-22 08:17:30,"At first this game was fun and family friendly untill u reach certain level where building houses are practically impossible and the free dice is all the same and they keep on giving duplicated gold sticker even it cannot be trade, yes it can be exchange with the vault but it still give duplicate sticker after obtaining the vault and again seems impposible because it only can give you best sticker after collecting certain amount of stickers. the price of the dice is so expensive and not worth buying if u are on a higher level. personally it was one of my favorate games. and about the heist other player are allowed to hiest large amount of money from me but my heist barely 1/8 of the amount being stollen from me even on a high roller. Im so disappointed with how the system work and the coustmer support is all bot where no help been given only answering to stupid qustion from the auto generated text.",Rip Off
1,2023-08-21 02:09:57,"This game is fun and addicting. However, the fact that I lost my alternative account twice, despite having a vast amount of info on the account or having it linked to AppleID can’t get the account back is just a terrible experience. Customer service has not been helpful and not getting back in timing manner (I’m not the only one with these kind of experience).   Also, the PM for the game clearly doesn’t know what kind of features players need. While, the “accept/reject” friend feature help protect people getting attack multiple times, it’s protecting the scammers that players hate and making the game not fun. Actually going into various forums and group to read through the comment and you’ll realized that the players actually just need a way to verify the trade so they don’t get scammed. Or perhaps the PMs should use your own product (playing the game) and get scammed.",Terrible customer service
1,2023-08-17 02:15:33,The games has been fun but everyone in my house hold has been playing and every time they get to the billions as soon as they go to use the money to upgrade all of the money is stolen. I get the stilling the money part but for these random people that aren’t your friends on the game are to steal every thing is insane. They only people we have bank heists are with the people we have on our friends list so how is it that the ones taking the money aren’t on the friends list? Are we missing something? Someone should be able to steal your whole 400 million or 1.6 billion in a heist as soon as you reach those points. The other annoying thing is the stickers. There are never any new ones. And it takes way too long to get dice. Was a great in the beginning but the crashes started happening and then everything has been crap since.,Fun in the beginning but has gone down hill.
5,2023-07-04 23:42:43,"I love this game it’s very addicting and fun to play however the wait for this is just out of hand, 1 hour for 7 dice is ridiculous, you literally have to spend money to get more dice, i understand the need for the app to make money but the wait for this is very annoying i mean i think an update to shorten the time would be nice, i mean i think maybe 10 or 15 minutes at least or if we have to wait an hour for dice then our dices should be full completely not just 5 or 7 dice but at whatever your maximum limit for dice are it’s only fair since the wait is so long other than that the game is great just change the wait for the dice",Love this game BUT…
2,2023-08-01 02:29:38,"This game is actually really fun, the main problem is the amount of dice you get without spending money. It takes 10 hours for me to get 50 dice for me to burn through in 10 minutes. The game concept is extremely fun but to win any event money has to be spent which means you won’t be getting rewards. Free to play for this game is completely untrue, also every time you log in your bombarded with new ways to blow money. And running out of dice u will be clicking the X button 20 times. There is also a weird thing me and my friends have noticed if you spend money your RNG dice rolls seem to make you land in better places which completely strips the point of luck In the game. The events within the game are extremely hard to get to the higher levels because of lack of dice to actually win more dice.",Game is only fun if u spend money
2,2023-07-25 15:10:19,"There are many issues I wish would be fixed. I love trading stickers with friends and throughout the group, BUT the issue is people holding onto them so they can’t be traded, and then SELLING them on all platforms. They’re being sold on eBay, Facebook, etc. This makes it quite unfair.  When the challenges are going, it’s clearly rigged to where we land on the spaces that we need to fill up the challenge a lot less. This seems quite unfair, especially when people DO spend quite a bit to play the game. Don’t rig your game. Make it fair. That’s what makes a good app developer.  It was fun, until it became extremely rigged and unfair. It’s too difficult to get the stickers, we get multiples of stickers we can’t trade (the gold ones). If we have multiples we should be able to trade regardless of if they’re gold or not, there is no reason for us to hold on to gold ones. It just leaves less for others to be able to complete their packs.  Also, the prizes for trading in sticker packs are terrible. I’m sorry but if we are trading in 500 stars, we should get more that 150 dice and a few duplicate stickers.   Make your game fun AND FAIR and people will continue to play and spend money too.

I am not going to pay for dice. It is so frustrating to see the same ad pop to buy more dice or share with other people to get dice. Then the cards. I get so many duplicate cards that I can not trade with anyone because we are all missing the same thing. If we aren’t, we don’t have a duplicate for the needed card. Fintastic and Boaring being the two most common cards with this problem. Monopoly Go is not even fun anymore. I do not even have the same benefits. I get small heist the majority of my bank heist. I never roll doubles to get out of jail. I am always landing on something that takes my money. I just frustrated because I can’t play more than five minutes a day because of lack of dice.

It’s incredibly sad we can’t trade gold cards, and seems like we always get multiple of them and never the ones we need.  The sticker collections rewards aren’t even as good as they were, where’s all the dice?!  I loved it at first but now I can’t think of why anyone would spend money when you’re not garaunteed to even get the rewards you earn?? The prices for the landmarks go up SOOOO high but yet with the limited dice by time you nearly enough to buy a landmark you run out of dice and people rob your bank clean out before you get enough dice to earn more money.

1,2023-09-11 15:42:16,Unfortunately I have to go low on this review because of the packs I spent money on. Everyone knows you have to spend money on this game to get dice. After spending money the game accepts my payment and freeze on me so I close it out then open it back up. Where are my prizes for paying nowhere in sight. I check my bank account the money for sure was taken. I contact customer service and they asked me for the usual email UN and proof I sent everything proof of me not having my prize proof of the money taken from my account. They said a customer service agent would get back to me ! It’s been ALMOST 2 MONTHS 😅 I’ll take this L but why say someone will look into it and nothing. Then I see people posting customer service gave them dice and money and I’m still waiting on mine crazy ! So be careful and screenshot everything! Probably won’t help but at least you’ll have proof !

1,2023-08-23 22:52:05,"I honestly love this game but I’m giving it a 1 star because if you don’t pay you barely get anything that you need. Then even if you do pay the game only likes to give you duplicates of things you already have which is annoying when you’re down to needing your last gold sticker to complete the album. Today alone I received 3 pink packs and 1 blue pack and got 3 duplicate 5 star gold stickers and 1 duplicate 4 star gold sticker, at least give me things I can actually trade or gift to help others out.  I wish the trading worked differently, where you could propose a trade and both parties have to accept it like the monopoly on the wii or something, we should be able to trade money/dice for stickers with other players, we should be able to trade gold stickers for gold stickers, and we need a better trade system that’s fair.  Do better monopoly I love the game but it needs some adjustments",Meh
3,2023-07-31 10:49:49,It’s a great game but there are some things that need to be fixed. I don’t think someone should be able to still over half of your money in a bank heist especially if you are having to pay for the dice in order to build your money up. It kind of makes people not want to play especially when you only get some many dice within so many hours. I also think you need to change how many dice you get and how often you get them. Also make the games more realistic that allow you to achieve more dice. Like having to land on utility 500 time within 24hours to win 500 dice is kind of unrealistic if you aren’t paying for extra dice and money and then you go to sleep and someone taken half if not over half of your money,Ok.

1,2023-07-27 02:12:43,I requested a refund for the past two weeks I have purchased dice not once but several time each day to see if I would be able to complete a set.  He it is week two and I haven’t completed one set and I’ve spent Hundreds‼️‼️ of dollars just to Get enough dice to gain cards to complete sets. I have not been successful and now requesting a refund at first the game was fun but it’s seem the higher you go the less you earn on top of lack of dice you’ll give just for completing a whole village leaving people to have to spend money to complete a village just to only receive 50 dice😒. I do believe the game has potential to be a long running game but if y’all don’t fix the problem and concerns that the customers have I can see this game is just been a faze and in a few months no one will be playing at all. Please respond send a personal email I’ll greatly appreciate it thanks,Not happy gamer
3,2023-07-26 22:49:36,"I really liked this game at first but as you move farther along, the rewards don’t increase. No matter the level, 50 dice is all you get. It’s also fun to complete albums until you get farther along. They make some stickers gold and if you only need a few of those, it’s almost impossible to get. The only way to keep playing is to keep paying. The price increases and the payoff decreases. I only need 2 gold and despite trading in 1500 vaults a few times and spending money, they are simply nonexistent. You end up spending a bunch of money and not progressing. It’s sad because it’s a really fun game but definitely not worth it because it’s clearly a money grab. You can spend a bunch of money for like 10 minutes of entertainment and zero rewards.","Starts fun, ends up expensive"
4,2023-11-11 03:21:04,I feel as if there should be a way to directly add friends in game without needing a phone number or Facebook account. Preferably a “recently targeted” or “recently attacked” feature would be nice. Just a way to go back and forth with people without having to wait for them to attack you first and then go to the “revenge” tab every time you wanted to continue going back and forth. Just a way to add them directly in game after they’ve attacked you so that people can have more fun online by actually having a back and forth rather than just suggesting three random people whom I’ve never seen or attacked before in my entire time of playing the game.,Love the game but friend system is questionable

However, due to the dynamics of the game changing  ( gold card needed for every set and lower dice given) it has become very frustrating. It should not take weeks to complete a set . Nor should you have to pay a substantial amount of money to try to complete them. Especially when there are so many glitches in the game. I honestly believe the creators have just gotten money hungry due to the game blowing up the way it did and they didn’t think about their customers.

Just a few days ago it was impossible for me to land on a tax or utility spot on the board because the game just kept landing me on the corners. Now that I need to land on the corners, all I land on are the tax and utility spots. On 1-10x you're more likely to land on the needed spots but it gives you such a small amount to the point where it doesnt even help with the progress to finish the event. I had over 5000 dice on each account and I only got 2500 tournament points when I was rolling on 100x.

It’s unfair that you have people winning first place all the time just because they’re spending money; while you have the causal player that’s low income not able to even place top 30. This has to be fixed! Furthermore, Gold Cards should be tradable! I have multiple gold cards that I can’t trade to friends to help them complete albums. Which supports my case of this is a pay to win app. You want people to spend $49 on a package just to get those gold cards and/or new cards. Also! We should be allowed more then just 8 dice after an hour! That’s another tactic to get people to spend money on dice because these events are limited on time. It’s all a set up",Pay-to-Win

It is incredibly frustrating to spend that time playing just to get frozen out. We can still chat to each other and the color flags just start blinking.

I didn’t know this was possible bc I’ve never gotten the same person multiple times in a row like that while I was doing a heist before so I thought it was a randomly selected person every time. I started getting spammed with notifications which was also very annoying. I literally got over 20 notifications from this one single person while they kept hitting me over and over until I had nothing.

2,2023-11-08 10:02:28,When I first started playing I loved it but as I continue to play I’m not loving it so much. I like the different worlds and challenges but the way the cards are given is terrible. Every deck seems to have the same cards over and over. It’s hard for me to get the gold cards and when I do it’s the same one repeatedly. How can we complete a deck if you guys are giving the same cards. You have added the function of trading good cards which is great but the downfall is that we don’t get to choose the gold cards we would like to trade. The system with receiving these decks of cards should change because there is no way I should have 5 of the same gold cards when I have decks that could be completed if only I would receive the gold card.

They routinely enable and override your volume settings, use obscenely long pauses to try to trick you into thinking you have to do something to get credit so you unwittingly click the app download, force you to watch endless sequences of lesser ads after the initial  ad which is already longer than average. They use false X icons to trick you into clicking the ad multiple times.   It’s ridiculous. Just completely insane how predatory the ads are. Absolutely infuriating!!",Most obnoxious ads on iOS adspace

4,2023-09-03 14:08:49,"This game is addictive. You constantly feel the rush of dopamine as you hit go and collect rolls, millions, and stickers that can lead to rolls and millions. My only feedback is that in the second round of stickers (Greek themed) they’ve taken away the amount of rolls you could get for completing albums. Making it less fun to play. This also forces people to buy sticker packs and rolls. When this game first came out, it had the original message of monopoly (capitalism can ruin us all look it up) with the exchanging of stickers, community events (baking a cake and building a car), and being able to reach out to others to trade stickers.  Now, it’s showing that capitalism is what they want. Buy buy buy!",This game is addicting!
1,2023-09-02 19:04:10,"Before the new album . The dice prizes were higher for each set. Now the max is 1800 which is set 21. On top of that they added 21 gold card stickers one in each set. That are not tradable, which makes it harder to even get the gold card stickers. I went through 5k dice before getting one gold card and the one I got was a 2 star gold, you guys need to make golds tradable. This is messing up a lot of users experience. As you guys keep increasing the prices for dice, decreasing prizes, increasing pack prizes while decreasing chances to get gold cards or high cards. This game makes a lot of money already the Facebook group got over 3 mil users in just a few months. Why not give something back to the users by allowing us to trade gold cards, increase prizes, increase our chances to win instead of making it harder  to win each time a new album releases.",Making it harder to even win
5,2023-07-09 03:23:43,"First off I wanna state this is a very good game which i adore but that doesn’t excuse the few problems i have with it, Waiting for the dice to recharge or just waiting for anything to recharge in any game is annoying. I’m not saying you should just add one of those watch this ad and you’ll get 15 dice or something, people don’t like that. Add something interactive like a couple of simple fun mini games relating to the games content, this way you can build up dice in a simple manner, i think this would improve the quality of the game and entertain people longer. Otherwise than that, this game is peak content but my patience is on thin ice monopoly. 👿",My person opinion 👽
1,2023-07-23 13:31:24,"This game is awful, you cannot win even if you have a decent amount of rolls. The challenges are impossible since the game won’t allow you to land on any winning spots. New stickers are few and far between after the first 9 sets are completed (look at the fb group for proof). You can only trade in up to 100 or 500 of your duplicate stickers every 24 hours so you never really get rewarded for all duplicates you have. Money hungry developers ruined the game by making the wait time 1 hour for 5-6 dice rolls, which they thought would incentivize the players to buy more. I refuse to spend money on this game because the odds of a good outcome are WAY too low. All of these factors sadly ruined a possibly fun game to play with friends. I would’ve honestly added a way to get rewards for watching adds but of course, these guys can’t pass up on the sweet sweet cash","Terrible game, could’ve been fun"
5,2023-10-01 12:21:23,This game is very fun but my thing about it is that yes there are not so many ads that it’s overwhelming but there are some and I don’t have Facebook so I can’t play with my friends that also have this app. Oh and please keep in mind that I’m not an adult so if you have any difference to what you think that may be why I’m just sharing my opinion but back to the game. It’s a pretty fun game the graphics are good and it’s interesting the only thing is yes there is auto roll but it gets a little bit boring watching the same thing over and over and over again. Ummm if you read this thank you I appreciate that. Thank you.,This is a great game but……
4,2023-04-19 05:16:35,"Great game overall, very addicting. I joined the Facebook trading group chat as well already to level (M) 376 not as high as everyone else, but you do have a chance to get to a higher level without purchasing anything. Do not assume it’s a Pay to Win game. I like the shield aspect but everyone else as well as me thinks it’s a little too difficult to gain dice waiting an hour for 6 dice? That’s a long time to wait for it to just disappear in 3 seconds. Give us better opportunities to gain more dice. Also the prices to purchase dice/cash are way to high. As well as the trading system something needs to be implemented in game so we can’t get scammed for stickers. Thank you for making a great game though!",Developers please read.
1,2023-10-30 18:37:23,"The probability of the spins you get on this game benefiting the player is really low after playing very consistent I’ve noticed it’s decreased exponentially from when I started… this game became such a cash grab to me from only playing 2-3 weeks… for example this weeks current car event is a scam in itself… hundreds of people are complaining because they have to use 10,000+ dice of their own to just get enough wheels just to finish one car… this is my first “Car” event and everyone has said in previous events the amount of points needed would’ve been 60,000 right now this event apparently you need 80,000 points to complete one car… with that being said I do not recommended Monopoly go as they clearly look like they want to reach into our pockets then have a happy playing community",Terrible probability as you upgrade your board and the more you play
4,2023-09-11 16:58:58,So I do find the game fun and addictive and my sister fine joy in taking each others money and crashing each others buildings down but this game could be so much better. 1: takes forever to get more rolls when you are out. A hour for 6 rolls is ridiculous. 2: Every time I clear a board why do I only get 50 more rolls? Shouldn’t I get more with each board? I mean the price to get out of jail gets higher so why wouldn’t the amount of rolls I get increase as well? I also think we should be able to request rolls from friends and send rolls like in other games. Don’t get me wrong I love to play it but I think it could be a lot better and a lot more fun for everyone.,Fun but could be better
3,2023-09-17 14:55:34,"i just got this game about two weeks ago when i heard a bunch of people at work talking about it.  immediately became addicted and was on it all the time. i still love this game but it's really, really starting to annoy me. i've only gotten one new sticker out of the past 100 packs i've opened. i recently got a duplicate gold sticker, which doesn't make sense because you can't even trade those. there are about 6 sets that i only need the gold sticker to complete, so why give out a duplicate instead of one that is actually needed? and they aren't even 4 or 5 star gold stickers. i need two 1 star golds and a few 3 stars. also, like half the world (including me) needs the ""boaring"" sticker. is it really that hard to find? i saw someone in the facebook trading group that has three extras of that card, and yet so many of us still need it. i know not every single pack can include a new sticker or else it would be super easy to complete the album, but come on! help us out here. we all are getting fed up, you should work on bettering your game if you want the people to stay satisfied and keep playing!",please do better! so many people love this game
4,2023-08-20 10:22:56,"I love this game. It gets so competitive and is very addictive. It even gives me the tiniest bit of nostalgia of family game night. Except I can’t play with my family all at the same time and this is why this review is not a 5–star review, read on please; I think the game would be even better with the ability to interact more with my active friends from social media, such as live chatting or some sort of group buy feature or even playing together on a live board in a private game. Also, I want it to be easier to accumulate rolls like maybe being able to send rolls to friends or something like that. Otherwise, really fun game when you have the rolls to play.","Very addictive, needs more interaction"
3,2023-09-08 05:11:42,"The recent update has definitely bugged some things out. Sometimes i have to reset my game to start landing on bank heists and shutdowns again. Ik this because ill go through 200 dice with no bank heists or shut downs. Also you guys should add an in game trading system so people can’t scam anymore. The trading is pretty much 1 sided someone can say they have something on the Facebook group then never trade it and expect u to send first. I mean its just a phone game and people are scamming on it. And your facebook group is completely full of people trying to scam out of real world money, trying to get people to click on shady links and all that. Definitely needs to be a form of in game trading menu where u can trade cards and it shows what you’re getting in return.",Fun game but…
2,2023-08-27 04:11:55,"This game is definitely fun and addicting. As a previous reviewer noted, I see a lot of reviews about issues with stickers, and while I do agree, my biggest problem is also bankruptcy. I got up to a billion dollars and woke up the next morning and over half my money was stolen by one person (who isn’t even on my friends list). Ever since, half of my money is stolen every night and more and more random people continue to pop up. I was once a billionaire and now I struggle to get to even 300 million. The money you gain back starts to lack. It takes well over 100 million to complete a board, and you only get 2 million when you actually complete it. I loved this game but now I can’t even make enough to do anything, and when I do, all of it gets stolen in a matter of a few hours. Definitely deleting.",Bankruptcy
4,2023-07-10 04:09:20,I want to complaining about the technical issues that I have had over more than 3 days. I have finally been able to play for two days. There has been a baking partnership event going on and I’m very late starting. So the last two days I have been playing to catch up as I’m 3 day behind everyone. I think that this is unfair to me. If I could have played those three days that there was technical issue I would have been able to complete all my cakes. Now I’m going to miss out to the reward because you didn’t give me enough time me play. I love this game and I think it is very unfair! I would give i higher review but I’m very upset about this event. The rewards are huge and I really missing out.,Ok
1,2023-07-29 21:56:25,"Fun game as I love ❤️❤️❤️ all the versions. My favorite is playing with Speed Die/Dice on PlayStation 5. The reason for this review is  1. Customer Support is Nonexistent. I have made several purchases on the game in app purchases but one time I did not get the items I purchased. I contacted support and was told to send screenshot which I did but I still did but receive my refund nor my account was updated with the items I purchased. Well okay I let that slide.  2. When trading on the Facebook groups there should be a way to report scammers who take stickers and then block you. It’s not fair for ANYONE who deals with that.  3. The 7/8 dice per hour is not enough. I am on Board 189 & It’s nearly 422 to buy one house which you cannot because you only get 7 dice per hour. That should be updated IMMEDIATELY…  4. The rewards for winning the Tournament is 1500, However for the past few winnings I have only been awarded 800 dice as like I’m further down the Tournament line when I have my screenshot.  It’s a fun & VERY VERY VERY ADDICTIVE GAME. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE MONEY TO THROW AWAY THEN DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I REPEAT—DO NOT‼️‼️‼️‼️ Other than those issues it’s a fun, challenging, & mind blowing game that’ll have you on the edge of your sleep. ESP when somebody robs your bank or attempt to shut down the landmark. Please FIX MONOPOLY",DO NOT PLAY
3,2023-07-16 03:46:18,"The game itself is fun, competitive and consistent in giving dice and money in order to keep me interested in playing more. Only downside is once connected to Facebook your profile picture is added as well. Though some might not see the issue as a young teenager I get lots of friend requests from strange men. I wish there was a way to change my picture to something other than my fb picture. I also had an issue with attempting to make a purchase. There was an error that had kicked me out in the middle of making a purchase and once I went to reload there was an error. Later than day I logged on and there was nothing added to the account but money was taken from my account. I know there was a lot of loading errors.",Good but…
2,2023-07-07 15:03:14,I was loving this game. Had so many of my Facebook friends and family start playing w me. It’s fun attacking each other. So I did a think where I stopped upgrading my board for three days to save a large amount of money up. Strangely on the fourth day I get bank heisted by some random person for 300+ million dollars 🫤 that’s like four board upgrades. Yet there is no way for me to friend that person so I can attack back and they aren’t on any of the score boards. That’s weird. I feel like you should not be getting attacked by random who you can not attack back by choice. This ruined the whole game for me. Honestly thinking about uninstalling it now. Never even had a friend take that much from me but a computer character did that’s crazy. I have more than 200 friends playing I don’t need randoms attacking me.,Random players.
1,2023-07-05 15:01:42,"The game is fun at first giving you a bunch of rolls to keep playing but I am now at a net worth of about 2,600 and it’s just not fun anymore you can’t get any massive roll gains in tournaments without spending money and getting in to roll for about 3 minutes just isn’t fun to me wish there was a way to play longer without spending money and the cost of buildings is between 20-30 million and it would take me all 80 rolls and getting lucky to upgrade one FREAKING building it’s just not fun. There are so many bug issues it kept my wife stuck on the community chest I got in touch with support which was no help so all in all I would not recommend to anyone and I just can’t believe a company would turn so money hungry they ruined a beloved childhood game both my wife and I uninstalled the game and will not ever be getting it back spend your money on something else not this stupid game",Fun at first

Monopoly go has rekindled my marriage, and has made it stronger than ever. I hope more players can have such a strong connection with the game as I did.

3,2023-04-25 23:23:13,Great game and great concept however where they aren’t doing great is you only get 5 or 6 dice every hour and it will only fill up to 50 and then 60. They never give you enough dice and only want to money grab. They make it very hard to progress through the levels and you can’t even send dice to your friends. They have tried to help by making a Facebook trading group for one of its quests but it’s impossible to actually get any help on there. The game is great or it would be if I could actually play longer then 2 minutes because that’s how fast you run out of dice and they are very stingy with the dice. They money packs that you can buy aren’t even worth what they are asking for it. For a “free” game I guess it’s great if you don’t actually want to play.,Great concept
4,2023-10-03 14:12:14,"I’ve been a nonstop player since I downloaded but I’ve run into some issues. For example just a few minutes ago I closed to app for maybe 30 minutes and logged back in to send someone a sticker. Upon doing so I see that it takes like 10 minutes to load, which was weird. Then when it finally loads in I’ve lost like three hours of gameplay. I’m back two maps, lost all my progress in the toy making competition, all my money, and my quick wins were reset. What the deal with that? Seriously upset about it, I would understand a few minute difference if I abruptly closed the games or whatever but almost three hours?!",Set back my gameplay
5,2023-11-07 19:37:20,"This game is absolutely awesome!!! I love it I love the animation. I also love how the auto roller is added because it makes it so much easier because if you’re doing something at work or you’re busy and you want to play it but you have your hands full you can put the auto roller on and then you go you can roll anytime you want you’re in jail you have to roll. The auto roller is there for you, how it is related to the board game? Is you earn money,  the monopoly, big heist, shut down anyway that’s all I have to say about this game.

I wrote to customer care to inform them that I have not been receiving my gifts from when a friend has joined and the bar is stuck at 3/10 when it should be full by now. I also made a purchase for $89 for dice, a purple sticker pack and money but I didn’t get the rewards I was supposed to get even though my card was charged and I am very disappointed in the direction which this game is going but no one has reached out with a resolution.

4,2023-09-11 14:57:54,"This game is rigged in so many ways. For this review I’ll be using the CHOCO PARTNER event as an example. Sometimes I land on chocos back to back and I get nothing, I would be stuck at 9 chocos on the wheel and I land on chocos it says +5 chocos but when I checked I still have 9, what sense does that make ? Why put the chocos on the board if I can’t win them. Also anything past +20 multiplier is Rigged, so many times I put +50 I wasted 1000 dice I get nothing good I land on the same stuff every roll. Before you guys patched predictions everything worked good now game is motivated mainly by rigged algorithms. What’s the point of doing events if they’re rigged. I have screen recordings where I test the +20 +50 even +100 waste of dice don’t do it.",Rigged
1,2023-08-28 03:02:37,"So there is several things that it’s rigged, when they have the milestones on landing on the corners, it’s near impossible to land in them, but when they don’t have it to land on the corners than I will land on it million times! Plus the game gets lagged and I never received my milestone when I achieved it. They also have the bank heist where people can steal money from you! The catch is though, that they can win 4 million dollars but on your side where they stole the money it will say 54 million dollars. So where did that 50 million dollars go to? The customer support is not any help because the never respond back. I am so fed up with this game of them not giving me the items that I won. Plus they have sticker trading and they be delaying a whole 30 minutes. You think the other person scammed you because you didn’t receive that sticker back instantly.",Rigged and rip-off
2,2023-08-04 12:50:01,"This game has nuances that will waste your rolls and multipliers. I had 5000 rolls and I used the 20x for majority of rolls and used the 100x for one roll when I pass the jail. This math SHOULD’VE gotten me decent amount of cash and a decent placement in the current perfect pitch tournament, but it has not. It because of the random number generator performance. It LAGS. Out of 4000 rolls ,at the math I stated earlier, I only landed on the railroad 7x, I landed in jail 0x(yes this is bad), I landed on community chest, just visiting and free parking 3x each, lastly I landed on the utilities and taxes 5x combined. I earned 1,000,000,000 and spent it and the monopoly wheel is glitched as well. I landed on 1.4m dollars 5x in a row. This should not be happening.

Back to the card system , absolutely hate how you get nothing but duplicates then once you get enough duplicates to open the safe, the safe gives you the same duplicates so you trade 100 of your duplicates for 5 to 7 duplicates again it’s a horrific cycle. Also hate how I have to play and COMPETE (sweat) against people that are bots and aren’t even on my friends list to get good rewards . Overall, I’m still playing hoping for a brighter future.

I’ve talked with others who are WAY higher up and it’s still the same number I think once you hit a certain level it should increase, why have board 10 and board 100 getting the same prize. The wheel spin should also improve the amount on prizes 5 dice really or 4.4K dollars, you can’t even upgrade a landmark with that.

I own the OG Monopoly app as well, it’s where this one excels, that one fails, and vice versa. Except the other game is actually worse. I digress…  Lots of spam on the UI, multiple pop ups over the course of logging in and during gameplay. No social aspect, no monthly play pass, no competitive gameplay. No strategy.

5,2023-10-26 17:22:22,This games for you if you like a greedy creator that takes every advantage from the players away while using bits and algorithms to make sure you don’t get ahead unless you spend money. On top of Scopely screwing the players over they approve of scammers and refuse to do anything about it. Meanwhile they can eliminate scammers if they actually put trading in the game. You never get anything you and are left to beg people for the sticker while they charge outrageous prices. So if you like a game where you being screwed over by the creator and other players go for it. Once my dice are gone I’m done playing. All people do is brag about how they cheat lol,Awesome

There has been more than 4 times, where I won something, and never received it. I reach out, and get no response.

It was fun for a bit but like any cash grab game you can only get so far until it starts feeling like a chore. I’ve had a few weeks of fun with this game but I am not an ATM and do not appreciate the game asking me for money constantly.",Hard Pass
1,2023-09-28 15:41:00,"game is riddled with bugs and customer support NEVER answers. additionally, it’s filled with micro-transactions everywhere and by everywhere i mean all around the screen. lots of scummy behavior overall from the devs and with each update they get greedier and greedier. it’s very obvious it’s designed with the intention of making players spend as the game itself is rigged. as a free to play player, you will hit a giant wall the higher level you get and it won’t be possible to keep playing as the rewards are purposefully not optimized to scale with you, so don’t expect to keep going without swiping. also the trading card system is a joke as the drop rate levels are abysmal and once again they will try to sell you a pack to guarantee you that one you’re missing for around $30+. but what else can you expect from Capitalism ™️: The Game?","truth is, the game was rigged from the start"
5,2023-09-21 11:15:28,I never rate games but….  This game is fun but it’s setup so you spend $$$ so you can continue to play. I get that they need to make money but you should be able to earn dice more easily or get more for your money or more during dice regeneration. There are people out there who have spent over 1k on this game 🤯. It’s a slow game if you don’t spend money. On some of the mini games they abviously group you with people who have a much higher networth & a crap ton of dice so they will automatically win the game unless you are willing to buy your way to the top. Please group folks with similar game networth & dice amounts in all mini games.,Fun game but oh so ever rigged
4,2023-08-11 16:24:01,This game is so much fun and really keeps you interacting with it and wanting to play.  My biggest complaint is that you can trade stickers with friends expect the gold stickers in the deck. If I have 4 extra and my friends need them then why shouldn’t I be able to trade them! Why even be able to get extras when I can’t do anything with them.I  Wish the developers would change that feature. I also dislike how it seems everyone is in search of the same stickers. I can get 30 stickers a day and they are ALL ones I already have. Not even one new sticker in a week of play is discouraging. Other then those few things I really enjoy the game and think it’s great.,Love it but….
1,2023-08-26 04:41:44,"Great potential here and I’ve had a lot of fun but there’s a difference between initial investment, and then expecting us to pay to play forever. With help of friends and good trades, you can get most of the cards, yet the gold ones are pure luck and such a terrible game mechanic. Getting a golden 5 star duplicate is completely useless. I’m not saying make it free to play but how much do you seriously expect me to keep spending just to finish some stupid album on a game that is ultimately pointless? Make it more accessible and less steep. There’s a way you could let us actually maintain dice for a bit but eventually still lose them, rather than just lose them right away like it is now. This just feels like a casino with the odds stacked against you. Frustrating to see a fun idea getting ruined by greed, but not surprising. You lost me.","Odds are too steep, totally unreasonable"
4,2023-09-12 05:00:43,"I love the graphics and animations. The mechanics are engaging. But the game is so easy it gets tedious. At times it’s like playing Pac-Man without any ghosts chasing you. The levels have fun animations and graphics with lots of interesting interval goals, but they are so easy to attain that they just whip by. I collect winnings and achievements so fast that I don’t even have time to see them. And I’m not very good at games, either. There are lots of offers to buy more game money, dice, or other in-app purchases, but it feels like they are trying to sell me more scoops of ice cream when I already have more than I could ever eat. I would like it, if they re-released the game with more challenging gameplay.",Fun animations but waaaay too easy
1,2023-10-30 20:11:18,"It was fun at first but events tends to get harder and harder and what I mean by that is, the challenges to complete certain milestones gets higher and higher and the less likely you are to complete them, especially if u are free to play. U can barely hit top prizes on daily challenges without spending money, or saving up rolls for a long time. But overall this game is just getting making events more and more impossible to complete without spending. Very wise for developers but for those free to play players RIP. Game is totally addicting but the amount of money that u put in it isn’t really worth because a lot of the game maps keeps repeating over and over again(for example the boards u unlock gets repetitive, events that you do is repetitive). The developers just don’t put much work into it for the amount of money u put into it and it’s sad.",Greedy Game
2,2023-10-26 12:03:23,"The game in itself is fun. It’s great for killing time when you’re just lounging about. I have played the game for a few months now and one thing I noticed is that the game seem to be forcing you to buy or spend money on dice. Since I have purchased some the game seems to be manipulated now and it takes forever for my piece to land on trains. Also, stickers it seems to stop giving new ones once you’ve passed a certain amount of collection. Whether you get one of those race packs you still get duplicates. It’s a bit ridiculous that you try so hard to achieve on getting rare packs or special packs for stickers but then you get all duplicates at least try to incorporate one or two new ones with the packs. The game is starting to loose it’s appeal when I first started it.",Better stickers
3,2023-10-26 09:59:02,"This game is fun, especially when you first start playing. It has now become a bit boring.  I feel the stickers are a scam, I’m thinking the developers don’t really want you to win the 15k dice you would get from matching all the stickers became they keep giving the same stickers out. It almost impossible to trade stickers too especially if a sticker frenzy is going on.   I also noticed that I don’t get all of my prizes for tournaments played.  I feel you should get more dice when you’ve completed a board as you increase your level and you should be able to get more dice with your Monopoly money.  As stated early, the game hasn’t really been fun for me anymore.   I don’t want to have to pay $10 for 200 dice or less.",Frustrating
2,2023-10-18 12:53:50,"The game is fun to play but in my experience, I’ve noticed that when I first started playing, I would always land on railroads to get the heists and shutdowns, but as I’ve gotten to higher levels, I never seem to land on them. I also ALWAYS seem to land on the tax spaces that take money away from me a lot more often when climbing to higher levels. The dice rolls are definitely rigged to have you land on spaces that don’t give any money or take money away. Also, it is impossible to collect all the cards unless you buy them. I understand these games cost money to make so the developers need to make money, but at least make it possible to get new cards without having to pay actual money for them. I have never put money into this game and never will, but this is just my experience.",Fun but Rigged

They fail miserably as far as customer support and give only canned responses and never address your issues. Please, if you download this game, give it a good month before spending any real money because that surely will give you a good idea that you shouldn’t. I see many people in groups saying they were over charged or charged multiple times for one purchase and had to go through many hoops to get their money returned. Be warned! Yes I continue to play only because I am hoping they will return to the original game play that was actually fun and gained them millions of dollars in a few months.

2,2023-10-05 02:05:45,"This game used to be great when I first started playing up until recently.  New cards are never received, partner events are almost impossible to complete I can waste 700 dice to collect 200 puzzle pieces and waste all of those by spinning on 40’s 60’s and 80’s. When process chest  is completed you get a few dice that last about 2 seconds and a pack of cards that contains cards you have at least 5 of. Cards are so challenging to get yet hardly worth anything once complete. Not to mention the constant glitches recently that have been effecting / not saving progress. And then when there is a glitch or error they don’t award everyone that was effected or don’t at all and when they do they reward you with again cards you already have. Not worth playing anymore honestly.",Not worth it
3,2023-09-28 12:26:22,"This morning I kept getting errors which would restart the game (prompting it to restart like 4 times before allowing me back on) then it started me back at my last shutdown (but with a different opponent each time) and allowed me to upgrade my landmark (again) roll once, then restart again. I did this same loop probably 6 times before uninstalling the app. I reinstalled and attempted to login using Apple - it showed me two random saves I haven’t heard of, so I tried via Facebook (my account was attached to my phone number as well as Facebook) but it gave me the same two random accounts to pull from, both with 0 progress. Frustrated at this point because I enjoyed the game until this morning :(",Was a good game until
2,2023-09-27 18:58:42,The thing that I don’t like is the dice are really hard to come by and when you complete a board it’s always 50 dice regardless of what level.  I do enjoy when there are special games like the race/dessert games where you team up because it does get routine just going around the board same thing every time around.  Also they issue a lot of the same cards over and over so completing an album is almost impossible unless you beg other players for cards which is impossible while in the game because no communication inside the game you must go to Facebook or personally text a friend that is playing.  Too many pop ups also for you to buy items I get they want to make money however does get irritating and your screen is covered with the options as well.,Fun game
2,2023-09-13 02:54:29,"This game has a lot of potential, but no dice. From chatting with others on the games various social media platforms, the game went through changes when it changed ownership, and not for the better. The game is pretty much a glorified slot app. If you like wasting money to spin/roll dice for no reason, you will love this game.  There is very limited reward in game play. Spend 1200 dice to win 900.  During events you get stickers for rewards the further you go. You get the same cards over and over and over. You can trade 5 times a day. Trade is not user friendly and scammers are everywhere. That could be a simple fix with trades needing final confirmation. They aren’t the only scammers, people sell links for dice, etc. etc  Some people have feeder accounts for stickers, a lot of feeder accounts.  Then there is the professional beggars, who just want people to give them cards. One recent event really peeved off a bunch of people. If you teamed up with someone who didn’t try, you didn’t get to finish either. Larger teams might help that.  This could be a very fun game. I don’t mind spending a bit of my entertainment funds on games.  I don’t see a benefit to it with this game.  Hard pass.","Could be, but isn’t"

They hit once every other day for millions and millions of $$ when I have the same friends collecting funds from me daily & the amount they collect doesn’t even add up to what these unknown people take from me! It’s very annoying!  2. I hate the fact that I constantly get duplicates cards if a set that I’ve already completed & it takes forever meaning like 2 weeks before you can get a new card! I waited on a new card for 3/4 weeks. Every time I opened a set of cards they were all duplicates! The game is supposed to be fun right?   3. Nobody should be able to shut down my landmark if they don’t have a landmark built. Isn’t that part of the game???  4. (Last) I need more than 8 rolls per hour!

I contacted customer support on the app which stated I had to wait at least 24 hours to put in a complaint. Which I think is ridiculous. I’ve received other stickers from other players all day.

When moving to a new board you should be providing 50 + say 10 extra dice for each board advanced. This won’t take anything out of your profits. 5. Don’t allow players to hit the same person 12 times in a row. It is not fair. This game is extremely fun and I get to play with friends.

All meanwhile you’re continuously bombarded by ads to buy dice (and the dice offer is ridiculously small for the price). Save yourself mounts of frustration and install another game.",This *used* to be a fun game to play
2,2023-09-19 09:33:05,"The game is so fun with all the little challenges, events and side games but the game doesn’t give you enough dice to even play the game! You get 8 dice an hour and only 50 dice for completing a whole board! I think that everyone who plays the game can agree that it makes it not worth it because you can’t move to complete the tasks you need! I think the game needs to make a lot of changes instead of just trying to make it harder for anyone to get dice. Its made near to impossible to not have to buy dice. Also since gold cards aren’t able to be traded I don’t understand why I am constantly getting repeats of the same gold cards when it’s hard enough to get packs that even have golds in them.?? I think it should be made that we don’t get repeats of the gold cards!",Fun Game But Not Worth It!!
3,2023-08-30 20:25:27,"I really love this game. It is seriously addicting. However, when it comes to getting stickers, it’s next to impossible to get everything without trading, and half the time people try scamming or refuse to help. Secondly, when it comes to the community chest, there’s ALMOST no way to get up to x20, let alone x50. How is it even remotely fair when it “randomly” chooses to land on the same exact spot it landed on the turn before, and it’s only your second time pressing the button to open it. I’m not saying everything should be super easy to get, but make it a little easier otherwise what’s the point of offering stickers or a x50 option for the community chest.   Other than that the game is super fun.","Good Game, But needs to have things fixed"

1,2023-08-27 19:50:39,The algorithm of this game is absolutely terrible. You will never get the cards you need to complete a set!!! If you don’t have any dice you will come to a complete stand still on the game. No matter how many boards you complete they will continue to give you 50 dice! You will not be able to build anything with 50 dice. Then they will give you duplicates of gold card stickers! You can’t even trade them. If you trade your stars and unlock the boxes you still won’t get a sticker you need. Let’s not forget the bugs on your phone. The app constantly malfunctions. Especially in the midst of you trying to purchase dice or money to build. Last but not least the app takes up a lot of space on your phone!!! Wayyy too much space! Do not waste your time and get addicted to this game you will never be able to complete an album! Save your MONEY!,Don’t DOWNLOAD!!!
5,2023-05-14 17:16:05,"Well this app is truly incredible it’s family friendly,fun and exciting u have so many things to do every time I think that’s all and some other activitie comes along I 100% think everyone should buy this app it’s awesome I could play this for a week straight and not get bored once download this game u will not regret it this is actually my favorite game if ur looking for an exciting game and twists and turns this is the game for u the graphics are great and tho it may not be very similar to the original monopoly i love it so much even more than the old one. I highly recommend buying this app it’s absolutely free!💖",Awesome app here’s what u need to know
3,2023-08-25 17:54:44,"The game itself is enjoyable, and I LOVE the side games such as plinko, cake building, free parking extras, etc, but as far as collecting stickers to complete the albums, it’s like pulling teeth! I feel like I have to give my first born to get something new!!! 😩 All I have left are gold stickers, and I keep getting DUPLICATE gold stickers. What’s the point of duplicate golds if they can’t be traded?! And as far as trading, people that you are actually willing to help in return scam you like con artists for a sticker you need over a FREE game! It’s getting ridiculous. I’m getting frustrated. 😔  **QUIT GIVING ME DUPLICATE GOLD STICKERS!!!! I cannot for the life of me understand this!!! I need 4 gold stickers to complete and I’ve gotten 6 duplicate gold stickers in the past 2 days!!!! The most frustrating thing ever!!!!",Sticker Review
2,2023-07-21 18:45:16,"Good concept. Could really be fun, but when I’m looking for a game on my phone, I’m looking for something I can play when I feel like it or have time. This ain’t it. It takes entirely too long to get more spins unless you spend real money. I’m not above spending money if a game is worth it, but I’m not going in to spend money at the word go. The fact that I have to wait an hour to only receive 5 moves makes the game forgettable when compared to others. I mean really, what am I gonna do with just 5 dice an hour?! From the reviews online, lots of people are already turning away from the game because of that and the fact the it’s impossible to complete sticker sets. I’m sure if you fix those issues, others will want to keep playing, but hey, it’s your game. Do as you see fit. 🤷‍♀️",Has potential
3,2023-07-19 23:03:05,"The game is good, and I love playing. However y’all definitely need to update the game. Also the card algorithm needs really updating as well. I have so many duplicates it’s not even funny, plus there should be an option to trade gold cards even if it’s only say once a week or something along those lines. I really do enjoy the game, but please update soon also please update the boards I know I’m far along possibly more than some but I’m replaying boards I’ve already completed. Also please consider upgrading how many dice you get each day and how much you win with the different little daily or every 2 days games that you play to win prizes (like 10 dice to complete a landmark is way too low) thanks!","Good game, definitely needs updating"
4,2023-06-30 03:03:51,"I grew up playing this game.  When I grew up I continued to play with my daughters, my husband, family and friends.  So when I saw Monopoly Go I just had to play.  I love it!!! But, the first 9 boards were fun, I even spent money to buy dice because I just wanted to play.  But after the 10th board things slowed down a lot and it became impossible to get stamps.  I joined Monopoly Go trading on Facebook but everyone needs the same thing.  I’ve been stuck on the same stamp pack for 2 weeks.  And because I can’t move forward I’m loosing interest.  I ve brought several people into the game but because I’ve been stuck so long I play a lot less.  And if it continues I won’t want to play anymore.",I love Monopoly!
5,2023-09-30 03:54:29,"WARNING: THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTING!! I’ve been playing this game for a month now and I’m already on board 40. With the events that’s happen every few days or the daily events, you can rack up tons of money and dice. It’s really fun to play with your friends too and try to shut down their landmarks or take their money from the bank so you can be on the top of the leaderboard. I’ve spent hours stuck playing this game because I just want to get more dice to roll and climb up the leaderboards for the events in order to win thousands of dice and millions of dollars. It’s really that addicting. I’ve lost sleep over this game but it’s worth it!",TOO GOOD!!
1,2023-10-28 00:53:58,"This game is fun but it turns sour when all the events require a huge amount of dice and the reward may be enough to where you break even but most often you come out on the losing end (spending more than you win).. You can’t win at this game without spending money. Even then it’s like flushing the money down the toilet.. You buy a $100 pack that gives you 3-4K dice and you could literally be down to zero dice in 30 minutes and not have anything to show for it. People in the tournaments somehow find ways of amassing large amounts of points to where you will hardly ever win or place in the event.  I was a winner at this game when i was paying large amounts of money.. now that i am not, i find myself begging people for stickers on Facebook and in last place in tournaments.. it was fun while it lasted as the game had a good run…",So much potential
5,2023-10-15 11:07:42,I play everyday and I’ve won many challenges recently where I’m supposed to get rewarded gold stickers and then I just keep getting the same stickers I already. Why am I wasting money on dice on trying to complete challenges to just end up getting the same stickers in 1st or 2nd place to just get gold stars stickers I already have. Makes me not even want to bother. I love the game but at the same time unless things change I will not continue to play. Putting a bunch of effort and wasting thousands and thousands of dice and not completing much kind of makes the game a bust.,Like the game but not getting anything
3,2023-09-17 16:31:00,Last season you you’d think to yourself you had a chance at finishing the whole ablum. But now they put a gold card in every deck. You can can only get those gold cards from certain packs. some arnt to hard to get but their higher star gold cards are near impossible to get unless you put a decent chuck of change in the game. Either take away gold card packs or start allowing people to trade gold cards. This game used to be fun but with this new season you know you don’t have a chance of getting any of the high gold cards without putting money in it. You have better odds at a casino then you are at getting these higher gold cards. Please fix the game it’s no longer enjoyable,Developers are getting greedy
2,2023-08-30 16:13:31,"This game is really fun in the beginning but unless you want to pay real money to play it gets old real quick. Issues for me: 8 rolls an hour is not enough to do anything that needs to be increased, gold stickers are ridiculous I have so many duplicate stickers it’s not even funny I’ve been waiting for the same 5 gold stickers for two weeks and all I get are duplicate stickers in the pack even when trading in for the vaults, lastly the one way friend issue needs to be resolved why can someone target me multiple times and actually shutdown my landmarks and I can only do one revenge on them because they are not on my friends list. I’m going to give this game a few more weeks into the new sticker album to see if it changes if not I’ll be deleting.",Fun in the beginning
4,2023-06-14 11:21:43,"Let’s be honest, the game is addicting lol. It’s fun to play. My mom and I both have it and play every single day. However, since this last update I’ve had nothing but problems! My dice and money keep disappearing or I don’t get it what it said I’ve won. I’ve gotten sticker packs several times, only to open them and it say I got zero cards. Also, the daily free gift keeps getting stuck in 0sec. I’ll close the game and reopen many times before it comes up. (Today it won’t work at all). Also, I thought with the latest update it said we’d have less pop ups? It’d be nice to only deal with it once a day,  not every time you run out of rolls.",Love the game but having lots of issues
3,2023-05-31 14:17:39,"Honestly, it is a great addicting game, but there are some problems need to be solved. For instance, I can’t change my profile picture or my desplaying name. I connected through facebook and changed my profile picture there, but it did not changed in my profile in game. The most important thing is that I won 525 dices in a tournement but I had to study and I didn’t play for two hours. After two hours when I open the app, not only all my 525 dices vanished, but also 3 buildings I bought and I moved back to the previous landing I was. I explained my problem in support contact part, but they never even answer me. It has these kind of bugs that need to be fixed. Please fix these and improve this game.","Great game, but needs improvement"
4,2023-11-02 14:37:36,"I love this game. I play it every day it’s very addictive. I have few pressing issues:  1) there should be a better system to obtain 4-5 star stickers as you progress through the game.  2) you should not be able to get more than 1 of the same gold sticker especially if you can’t trade (I don't count that cheesy 12 hour window to trade 2 gold stickers of the games choosing). 3) Your dice earnings should increase as you complete the boards, just like everything else costs more (jail, upgrade landmarks, etc.) 4) We should be able to send dice to our friends and even leftover stickers if we finish an album.","Great game concept, very frustrating algorithm with gameplay"
2,2023-10-20 16:31:16,This game would be so much more fun if people wasn’t asking people to send 15 stars worth of cards for 1 sticker in return. The trading option should be like real monopoly to avoid people scamming. It should be order to trade both people have to put the agreed upon sticker and both get to see and have to accept the trade. It’s too many people not sending what they say they will or not sending at all leaving the other person that did send out of a sticker. Also with trades it needs to change or how many stickers a person can send one person a day to avoid the asking for 15 stars for 1 5 star card. Also the amount of duplicate stickers and then the vault doesn’t even give but maybe one new card after all that saving up of stars 😒….,Trading stickers needs an update!
2,2023-10-16 09:29:12,"When I first started playing Monopoly I came in with 30 days on a sticker set and I had almost every CARD. It was so much fun getting the stickers and trading with my friends but  Now that’s we are way more than two months in and I have less cars than I did after 30 days I’m getting doubles on golds which is ridiculous if you can’t trade them why are you giving them to us and I haven’t gotten a new card in over two weeks getting very disappointed playing less and less. The chips during  last tournament were very stingy.  There is no way for me to get dice and I REFUSE to buy them.  But maybe that’s why they are doing it. Who knows,  used to be fun when you could win dice to play but 8 dice every hour does nothing for the crappy rolls I get.  rant over.",Disappointing
5,2023-08-28 13:15:53,Can barely get new golden cards to complete sets. The only people on here saying it’s perfects are the ones who buy the content on the game. Can’t say that’s all true people on trade group who pay over $50 and still don’t get a new golden card to complete their album. The game still just give you 50 dice and about 2mil like the boards don’t get way more expensive as you pass them. This game is revolves around getting their money. At least raise the amount of dice you’re freely giving out and raise the amount of dice and card you get on the games store.

3,2023-09-24 06:50:50,"The game is fun, but unless you’re willing to spend a lot of money, you won’t get far. The amount of dice you get after completing each level never changes, which is not helpful since in-game expenses to reach new levels gets much higher. The locations of the levels repeat multiple times, which is boring. The makers do whatever they can to shut down any outside resources that can help you advance. Also, getting duplicate gold cards when you still have missing ones is a scam. They also lowered the amount of dice you get from completing sticker albums significantly. There’s a bunch of packages you can buy from them directly, but it’s not worth it. It’s all about getting money from us.",It’s all about the $$$
1,2023-09-15 14:15:37,"This game used to be so fun for me with the old methods they had in place, like reviving 100 friends on Facebook instead of 10, or (now currently about to) not limiting the friend bar to even trying to place another cap on it at 50. This game has just gotten so greedy to the point they are only desperate for people to spend money on their game, even though they made it free to download! Otherwise why else would they limit how much free dice you can get, considering it’s not any unfair advantage if EVERYONE has access to it. Monopoly just made it less fair by stopping the Facebook invites at 10, and soon enough monopoly will eventually see its long time players leave because at the rate this game is going with its updates (which they also don’t clarify the details within the update) , I wouldn’t be surprised if I quit the game.",This game is just going downhill
1,2023-09-08 13:25:55,"At first, this game was great fun and addicting. The different events and rewards made it so much fun and getting to play with friends was great. But now that they’ve seen how many people are playing, the events are horrible and the rewards are a joke. They make sure that people can only play for a couple minutes and then you either have to wait hours and hours to gain more dice so you can play a couple more minutes or buy the dice, which the prices are outrageous! The last set of sticker albums was hard to complete but the lower end ones could be done easily with the help of others but now every sticker set includes one golden sticker, which can’t be gifted from friends and are nearly impossible to collect unless you spend an obscene amount of money.

5,2023-08-26 13:51:11,Love this game but dude can we get more rolls for completing boards ? After you get over 4000 level and still getting only 50 rolls is pretty offensive lol 🤣 I get it yk you want us to pay and occasionally I will but ain’t no way I’m paying daily unless I’m close to winning an event. & we should be able to trade gold cards for the last 2 days of the season. Stop being unfair. I spent weeks looking for 2 gold cards and helped so many finish their sets & I spent so much money I love this game but imma delete it cause it’s messing with my gambling habits. & too much mental stress for you to be playing with my money and emotions like this monopoly 😭😭,Good game
5,2023-09-16 18:58:00,"This is a great and addictive game overall, but there are somethings that could be better. The whole card ideal is just a problem that’s needs to be fixed. Make gold cards trade-able if your not gonna give us the cards easily. I have spent money in this game and still got nowhere so what’s really the catch? Waiting so long for 8 dice is crazy to me. Why not g oh be us a full bar at least. When completing boards we need more than 50 dice especially players like myself who are on higher boards (100s). Other than these few concerns the game is great and definitely fun playing with my friends!!",Minor concerns

Also, if the multipliers would work on money wins properly.  3. If There weren’t so many duplicates cards. There needs to  easier obtainable goals to win the packs that have the better cards… without paying money for more dice or card packs… which btw typically have more duplicates… yay for wasting money. And trading cards is a scam on the Fb pages. So hard pass on that suggestion. 4. If I was playing more random players, than the same ones over and over. With millions of downloads and probably 50k playing at any point, it’s annoying to keep shutting down or heisting the same players.  5. If Monopoly Go hadn’t made over 135 million since April with over 40 million downloads to keep giving small amounts of dices, duplicate cards and small money winnings     Please make some changes because at a certain level of the game… we’re tired of playing for same rewards, levels, players and cards.

4,2023-08-02 04:25:17,"I love playing monopoly GO with all my friends. Everything about this game draws you in and keeps you coming back for more. One thing I will say is off to me is the profile customization. I'm stuck with a no photo picture on my profile, it really is taking a toll on the user experience with such strict customization, also somewhat wasted potential. Please allow us to change photos and usernames❗️ You could even provide the generated sticker profile photos as options by implementing a small selection to choose from and being able to change your profile photo sticker as you unlock more stickers by playing the game..

In the groups, everyone is scrounging for the same stickers. If you get 30 stickers a day that are consistently duplicates for a week, there’s really no point in playing. It gets old, quick. Cute concept but needs improvement to keep people interested. There’s almost no point to it. If you add people from these groups to trade something, they end up attacking your board- I know this doesn’t have to do with the game itself, more of a warning because the game suggests you trade & you have to add them to do so.

3,2023-06-14 18:18:09,"Yes. Downloading the game is free. Yes playing it with the 5-6 rolls it generates per hour is free. That said, there’s literally no possible way to win any of the extra stuff in this game on 5-6 rolls per hour unless you don’t play for weeks and allow those rolls to add up over time. I downloaded and started playing with a friend. Spent $100 on rolls within one week at $5 each. When I went back and added it up I was furious. Yes it’s my fault, but there is literally no reason in the world why a game that cost $30 off of a Walmart shelf with endless rolls should charge people to roll dice.

In the last two months with the new collection of cards I’ve gotten no new cards. When it comes to the special event to trade gold cards, since some are rather rare no one has them to trade. On top of which when it comes to the building events (cars and toys) the wheel ALWAYS gives me the lowest numbers in the wheel!

When you do get a chance to spin the wheel for a chance of winning sticker packs, vaults or other prizes, you always end up with the money which doesn’t help once you reach higher levels where it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade properties. A game that was once fun for my whole family to play has become a game that requires you to pay to win, if spending $25-$100 to win a pointless game is your thing, then this is the game for you.

I know there is the option to trade on FB but with all the warnings who wants to risk getting scammed?

In the Facebook groups there are a lot of people that haven’t had a new sticker in weeks, myself included, making it harder to complete. There’s bots that Scopely has made in the game to target your account when you have alot of money and robs your bank of ALOT more money than a regular person would be able to take.

Obviously you have to put in some work as you level up, things get expensive but the problem is the game/app is not playing fair with these mistakes that “coincidentally” cause you to lose out on competitions, money, and dice rolls in hopes that you will spend your money on their outrageous prices.

3,2023-08-22 23:14:49,I like it but we many people are having issues with people stealing stickers or cards when trying to make trades. Please make it to where in order to make a trade there is a window and once both sides have placed their trades in the window only then can you lock it in and make the swap. It takes all the fun out of it when people steal from you and everyone’s trying to play the same event. If not please allow us a better chance to get the stickers we need. If it’s a competition you shouldn’t be able to pay to win it. Defeats the purpose. If money is the goal then maybe get ads in here people would definitely watch ads for free rolls. Just don’t have them popping up everywhere.,Cute game but needs work
1,2023-08-13 02:33:48,"Where do I even begin? The tasks are made to be impossible unless you spend money. And not just $2 here and there, no, like spend your paycheck on this crap. The amount of rice you get, please, it’s a joke. Especially to reach the milestones in order to get the gifts and things to need. Like stickers and such. They make this game freaking impossible. And their facebook page??? A JOKE! You got scammers all over that thing, pulling a fast one on you and stealing your stickers, selling stickers for real money (how about no), no one helps anyone. And all the effort I put into this game, I even spent a little money on it myself (thank god I wasn’t crazy enough to be blowing paychecks on this scamming freaking game), the game crashes when I sign into my account and try to open the app. Try and contact customer support, nothing.

3,2023-08-06 14:38:02,"i really have been enjoying this game! it’s fun and pretty addictive when you get into it!   there are some things i don’t particularly like however; the rolls are pretty annoying. luckily i haven’t been playing super long and i’ve been able to gain more rolls from levelling up. but once that gets harder, i know that it would be very time consuming have to wait SIX hours in order to get just 30 rolls.   i don’t mind the fact that people “visit” my board while i am away. and do things like shutdowns, bank heists, etc. because i obviously do them too. i DO NOT like it when i come back and literally one person took ALLLLLL my money from the bank heist. literally wiped my account clean. it doesn’t seem very fair and i think that the amounts should be smaller. i again, just started playing recently and don’t have a lot, so when i come back to have nothing??? i don’t even know if i want to continue when everything costs 10x MINIMUM on my board than what i currently have. it really really turned me off from playing the game now so this is something i feel should be fixed (esp for new players).",fun up until…
4,2023-06-16 20:13:45,"I love how fast paced the game is, I love that regularly the competition change, & I love how connected to a community this game is. The only issue I have is that the app recommends joining the Facebook page to trade cards and the Facebook page has to have posts approved by admins. Unfortunately There aren’t enough admins to approve the amount of posts that they receive therefore posts I submitted 2 days ago are still pending. I’d hope for a more efficient page for a game that thousands of people are actively playing especially when we’re all playing in a competition on a time crunch. We don’t exactly have time to wait long when we’re trying to win a challenge.",I love this game
3,2023-07-12 02:36:31,"Honestly, I wish I could give this game 5 stars, but I can’t. I really enjoy it but since the 1.4.0 update a month ago, I am FLOODED with pop-ups now. Before that update, I barely had any. Now, I have at least 5 when I log on, and then every time I run out of dice for the multiplier I have, I get about 3 more. Then I change the multiplier again, and after that is done, I get at least 2 more. I will continue to get more until I am completely out of dice AND THEN MORE POP UP. It’s getting to the point where I am almost turned off by the game and have considered not playing anymore.

1,2023-10-31 15:20:23,"Cash grab gambling simulator. Game draws you in with quick advancement and lucky rolls and such, but once you get to level 50/around board 50, it’s not fun and takes forever to advance. It also bombards you with ads offering in-game rolls (turns), in-game currency, stickers (collectibles), and essentially loot crates, all in exchange for real money, and when you see your friends advancing and you run out of rolls, it’s incredibly tempting to spend that money, and it can easily get out of hand if you’re not careful. With all the micro transactions available and mini games (side bets), this is basically a simulation of what old people do at slot machines, except they probably win more than you ever would, and when they do win, they win actual money.

2,2023-09-23 14:10:50,If you are on lower levels it’s super fun but once you get higher and higher there’s no possible way to finish albums or even clear a board without paying a lot of REAL money. They could make this game so much more fun with easy fixes like more rolls and actually giving you cards you need other than 8-10 multiples of one and two stars. They just want you to pay more and more money and sometimes you still get multiples and not even new cards. There’s so many of the same cards that people in the groups don’t even have and they fact that some people SELL these cards on Facebook should be totally illegal. Make it fun again and realistic to actual be able to finish without needing to spend hundreds of dollars of your actual real money!!!,Greed at its finest

Collecting stickers, participating in the events, and playing with family and friends. However, over the past couple of months or so the game has become more frustrating than fun.      Pros:  You get the play with family and friends   There are an abundance of fb groups for sticker trading   Rotating events and tournaments keep the game motivating   Cons:  There is no dedicated trading system to prevent sticker scamming   Game is very much pay to win   Some stickers are near impossible to get  Events are rigged (probability decreases depending on the event)  Event goals are not universal   You cannot remove a non participating partner in partnered events   Game glitches can cause loss of rewards  Customer service is non existent.. I sent several messages about problems that caused a loss only to never hear anything back, and I couldn’t talk to a human about it  Essentially everything is rigged to make you spend money with no guarantees, and it’s only getting more expensive.",Addictive game with shady practices…

Especially when it takes 1 - 2 to build a land mark when you reach any level above 150. But yet the amount of money we pay out for bail keeps going up. The math ain’t mathing. So what is the incentive to keep playing once we reach any level above 150.  In addition why so many repeat gold cards we can’t trade.  Everyone in the trading group is looking for the same cards to complete albums. At this point why should I keep playing.

If Scopely really cared about their players they would set up in game actual trade tab where you had to approve & cards sent same time so scamming impossible. They also need better way to invite than a link, a unique user name/number for people to enter would be better.

As with any game, you can tell it’s rigged 😥🤷🏻‍♀️ just is what it and my only complaint other than that would be, if the developers could adjust one thing it wuld be, when we attack someones landmark and are blocked by a shield, for me personally I just don’t feel we should be gettin $$$ for it. If we hit it and no shield pops up then yes we should get $$$! I also would prefer there to be more honesty in how much $$$ is taken/ given! For one small example in heists, if 175million is taken then that shuld be whats given… not more NOT less!  Anyways, other than those, love it!",Like….
3,2023-05-15 19:24:44,I really enjoy this game but some of your prizes are a little unrealistic  The 24 hour challenge are awesome! I enjoy having a goal to play to but I just went through 5k dice and only collected 19/25 prizes. At $100 for only 3k dice is a little steep. Expecting your players to spend $200 a day to try to win is crazy. Your pricing all around is a little much. $1.99 for 30 dice. Don’t know how long i plan to play now that I’ve gotten all the cheeper packages. Just doesn’t seem worth it.   A little screen space would be nice to. I understand the need to run ads and what not but I have zero room to actually play because 75% of the screen is taken over by a push to buy things. Leave it there just make it smaller.,Mid.

Also, monopoly, I have brought so many players to the platform and now that I am not getting rewarded for inviting more friends I’m done playing.

I spent over 5,000 dice in the last 24 hours and don’t have a single car completed. It spiked from 60,000 points to complete one to 80,000 and you get the same amount of time? Not to mention, you have to get 20 steering wheels to even spin the thing and it’s constantly landing on 40-80. Rarely land on a partner gift, free spin, or 1000.

My net worth was past 8k and I had many tokens and had about 170 cards this album. After the update all my stuff was gone in my game it made me start over like I just downloaded the game. I have been in contact with support for about three weeks to be given no help what so ever it’s ridiculous support is a joke and doesn’t actually help! Honestly all I’m mad about is my tokens I lost and all my cards I had this album I was almost finished. I gave support all my information to be given no help still! Is this how we treat people who spend money on this game? All I’m asking for is my account back that’s it!

Trading on Facebook is a joke because most of the time you don’t get the one you want from whoever you sent one of yours to. And if you don’t spend money, it gets boring waiting for rolls every hour.

3,2023-08-30 03:29:49,I would have given 5 stars but the fact that the last  couple of sets were and re near impossible to collect really bummed me out. All the other sets were easy to o stain and trade but the last 4 sets. I mean come on. I may have invested $40 minimum because the game got addicting for a while but then to tease that if we spend x amount of money to get cards that we don’t have and not be guaranteed and what’s the point of having different colored card packs when you aren’t going to give and new ones. Is it’s green then yeah basic but any other color like blue or purple where are the new cards?!?! Hope this changes and y’all do better or I’m deleting this game. Waste of time and money and late nights,Card collecting
1,2023-08-29 17:55:39,The game is addicting and they entice and bait and switch through and through. All just a money grab. They’ll wait til you’re top of winning an event than all of a sudden in a matter of 30 minutes there’s someone ahead you by 5k + points to pressure you to roll more and spend money on dice. You cannot trade gold plated stickers but you are able to acquire more than one of them. Why can you get duplicates if they can’t be traded? They also should update and add a trade feature with friends. There’s too many fb groups and people scamming each other for hard to get cards. Their prices for in game purchases are also ludicrous. For the amount of money I’ve spent already they just continue to increase the amount versus keeping it the same. In game purchases for me for bundle are minimum of $90-$100+,Poor design with stickers and they bait.

The deals for the packs are tailored to who pays more they aren’t the same price for everyone…. The fact that I tried to have this issue rectified and I have been ignored is just ridiculous. When we need to land on the corners we never hit them but anytime the game doesn’t require it as a milestone I hit them all the time. I’m extremely disappointed.

3,2023-08-28 00:41:51,It’s not possible to do well without spending money. They give constant duplicate golden stickers which serves no purpose since you can’t trade them. I had to spend $20 to complete the album because I needed 1 sticker FOR WEEKS and would repeatedly get duplicates instead. The cost of upgrading scales but your dice rewards don’t which makes no sense since it takes so many more dice to accumulate the money needed to upgrade the boards. You’re spending 10+ BILLION dollars to finish a board and they give 50 dice which doesn’t even refill your capped 80 dice nor will it give you enough money in return to build upon the board.

3,2023-08-27 12:48:35,"This game is very addictive to say the least. It hosts events to complete to win dice money and more however it’s so hard to complete. The sticker events is almost impossible to complete on you own, you have to get help from the Facebook groups but people are too stingy to help anyone out. Dice links can be created to get 100 additional dice but you cap out at 100 friends which I think is stupid. My three star rating is only because of how hard everything is to complete I can play all day and night long and still get no where in the game or close to completing. People who are not your friend on the game is able to steal money from you as well as knock down your buildings.",Love the game but hard to complete events

My son is on a much lower level than me so he was given a bank heist of only $1,300,000. I had over $49 million in my bank. He got three rings and somehow I am now bankrupt?!?!

Technically you can only gift, trading is up to the 2 people willing to trade and if they’re honest and actually send a sticker.  There should be 2 options, gift or trade, for the trade option both players would submit a sticker to trade and they would both have to accept the trade, if one of them declines then the trade is off.  I’m surprised this hasn’t been done considering the FB page and the amount of people complaining that they were “scammed” from a sticker. This would also help by stopping people from buying/selling their stickers with actual $$$ (potentially getting scammed) and helps keep player base.",Trading
4,2023-09-20 19:24:17,I truly enjoy playing this game. My only issues I have come across is the number of rolls you get unless you buy some. We should be able to share rolls with each other if we want to. Also the cards we are given are more repeats then ones we may need to complete albums.  I have purchased different offers that they have thinking that maybe I might find the card that i need and that tends to end up the same way.  I have talked to others that play and these are the same issues they speak about.  Other then that we play this as a family and enjoy knocking down and stealing each other’s money.,Need more rolls

With the amount of money ppl collect they should be able to buy dice. Now with the new album it’s been weeks since I got a new sticker, and the box where it tells what you get once you complete this album is blank doesn’t display any rewards also you’ve lowered the dice prizes on the album and it’s harder than the first one.

I know the goal is for the app to make money, but it would be a shame that the game eventually becomes less fun for players who can’t afford to buy dice everyday.",I’ve played this game longer than any other game on my phone.
4,2023-09-15 13:54:54,"Ok so I really enjoy playing this game. Its fun shutting down other players boards and robbing their banks, and the events are cool too! My only complaint is like many others, the dice. Our dice should fill each hour. I understand the game is free to play and that yall have to make money, but it gets boring and people will start to lose interest. I’ve already did once. I quit for about month until my husband starting playing and I got back into it. A suggestion I would make is to maybe do like other games and let us watch ads for things like dice and allow us to send dice to our friends. By us watching ads, yall get paid. Anyway fun game",Love this game
2,2023-05-11 17:10:52,"It’s an interesting concept but it’s incredibly pay-to-win for events. While the game is ad-free, it has microtransactions in order to keep the game that way. The way it delivers these microtransactions is perhaps the most annoying I have seen from any game; additionally, the pricing on these are the worst and most inconsistent, which I guess is pretty ironic for a Monopoly game. Whenever you run out of rolls, it spams you with pop-ups to try to get you to buy microtransactions. This happens EVERY time you run out of rolls, even if it’s back-to-back. It also does this whenever you open the game. The list of inconveniences goes on and on, and it also intentionally makes the time between actions as drawn-out as possible to minimize your patience and maximize your playtime. Clever, but incredibly annoying.",Meh
2,2023-10-30 13:28:49,"The game started out really fun but it is impossible to win the events now without spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars. I know the intent is to make money but when you weed out all of us that would spend some, but can’t afford hundreds or thousands, there won’t be that many left to play. Is it even possible to complete the sticker albums? I see in the past people completed 2 or 3 times. Haven’t had a new sticker in weeks and still need several. I like the competition but also like to win. It seems impossible to win the spooky truck event this time- the amount needed has increased  a lot and there are much less wheels are being awarded.  Seems like greed will eliminate many of us from playing.",Too expensive and hard to win events
3,2023-10-03 02:18:17,"I love playing this game, but one really glaring issue is the fact that this game fails to update when you leave it. For example, when I upgrade buildings, I’ll go to play it the next time and it shows they weren’t updated (and it’s not like I update them then leave the game). I’ve even seen it to where I update buildings, leave the game, come back later or the next day, those updates are still current, but then I play the following time and those buildings (which were updated 2-3 times playing prior to that), are being shown is not updated. Basically I’m spending the same $140m+ several times to upgrade the same exact thing.  This needs to be fixed!",Issue to Fix

Was able to open my chest and pretty much after that it takes forever for it to get to the highest is gone is 30% and then it fails and says retry, my Internet is up my phone has been turned off and turned back on. Not sure on what to do. Also, since I have started playing this app for about three weeks, I love it but I feel like after a certain point you can’t go anymore they give you the same cards I feel like when you finish a board that your dice should increase to not just the money amount, but other than that it’s a good game hoping to start playing soon since I haven’t been able to play since this morning .",App is not loading.

Yeah it’s supposed to get harder but there’s a difference between difficulty and physically being unable to play because you don’t have the dice to do so. It’s impossible to achieve high prizes, it’s impossible to increase levels, it’s impossible to finish sticker packs, this game is just impossible to play. There’s nothing that helps you gain more dice… of coarse… unless you want to pay $5 for 180 dice. (It doesn’t sound bad except the face that most people will go through it in less than 5 mins.) I’d suggest only downloading if you have extra cash to spend.",Further you get the worse it is.
1,2023-09-20 11:19:45,Missing rewards and dice on several occasions. To complete levels and competitions you have to purchase costly dice at their in game stores as they only provide 8 dice per hour. When purchasing extra dice I have been double charged. Ive seen numerous complaints pertaining to the same issues from other players. The customer service chat is terrible and they do not follow up on the complaints or resolve any issues. The latest album has far less dice gifts after completion. The game started off fun until Scopely decided to price gouge and force updates to make it impossible to even receive extra dice on the friends bar. Also gold stickers needed are nearly impossible to obtain. If you have hundreds or thousands of extra dollars to play. This game is for you. Otherwise you will be disappointed!,Do not recommend
1,2023-09-14 14:15:35,Not the game cheating after you pass a curtain level. Come on now I dont never land on the spots that I need to get what I need. Plus y do we get only 50 dice for every level passed we want more. And what’s with the double dice roll when You in jail? Never give you the dice it’s very frustrating when you spend money the game wants you to keep spending money and I call that cheating. And then I added a few people that never had the game I have been stuck at 8 of 10 invites I’m over it it’s like the game don’t want to give you the rewards. What happen to all the friends I added this week smh. Y’all have to do better I spend over 50 real money on this game for y’all to be trying to cheap me so bad give me my rewards. And change some stuff make it better I feel like y’all have enough people to grant what we asking for,Over it
5,2023-08-22 15:28:50,The animation is AMAZING. Every board upgrade has a story if you just watch the characters!!! I use my dice a lot to play the game and so I don’t have a lot. I spend most of my time watching the board animations of each character. It’s absolutely creative during each board upgrade. Like in Ms mountain. Watch the cat by the vault. He watches the vault prizes grow and next upgrade he jumps in and his person bangs on the button to open!!! And the kids on the flying machine!!!! So please give the creators some love. There’s a lot of hard work and creativity in this very addictive game that you will LOVE!,Give the creators a little love today
1,2023-09-11 12:26:31,"Since I’ve installed the game, I’ve experienced glitches where I paid for packs and didn’t receive them until days later and the app “had to close” due to error and I lost dice, money, and stickers. I’ve reached out to customer service MULTIPLE times and not a single response. I’ve seen posts where people have been waiting for weeks for responses and they’ve been cheated out of tons of money, dice, and stickers.  Update: I emailed customer service AND reached out by in-game support AGAIN and NO response. This is by far one of the worst games I’ve ever played besides they’re greedy and they don’t care to help their players. I’ve seen posts about people receiving tons of dice and money even if they went screwed over somehow, yet people who’ve been waiting for WEEKS haven’t received a single response. Worst. Game.

1,2023-09-07 21:05:59,"The creators are very greedy. So much so that the game is not fun anymore. They reduced everything to make more money. Everybody I know from Facebook and the trading group and personally has spent over $500 a piece on rolls. They STILL decided to reduce rewards and make it harder to get cards, trade cards, and complete sets. They notified us today that you cannot get rolls from adding friends. It’s ridiculous y’all are greedy. If every single player only spent $10 you are still making a million dollars. There was no reason to reduce rewards etc. other than greed. It’s not fun because you only get 8 an hour 80 rolls max which is not enough to play and win anything. It’s only fun if you spending $100 a day which is ridiculous. We were enjoying playing with friends trading cards and winning rolls. Now it’s no reason to plays",Too greedy
1,2023-09-07 20:19:42,You changed the amount of dice we get in the album. Changed the amount of dice we get from fb. You don’t give the players any support. Customer service takes a month to respond and when they do they give the bare minimum. Overall the developers just want to make money. Every time you spend money the items in the shop increase and never goes down.  They don’t care about the players what so ever just the money. As you increase in level they don’t give you more dice just makes it harder to level up and play. Go back to the way it was before you messed everything up. The Facebook group has to many scammers and they don’t do anything about it All these events are dice eaters just so you can buy more dice. Don’t waste your time. I would literally give 0 stars if I could,The game gets worse and worse
5,2023-07-20 21:09:05,It seems like this game is geared to ensure folks with a Facebook account have the upper hand. It should be both major platforms. I can never take advantage of the free dice for people joining or anything. I only have an Instagram account. I like the game itself but not getting the cards you need as well as multiple duplicates that most you can’t even trade makes it not worth playing. Will probably uninstall before the end of day. I’m over it. May do coinmaster or something else. Way to go developers. You have a biased game w/ not enough diversity & inclusion. Thumbs down,Not fair to players who don’t have Facebook!!!
2,2023-08-09 00:15:46,"This game is a really fun micro version of monopoly! I really love playing this game and open it every couple of hours to get my free spins, but oh my goodness does it get annoying to play sometimes.  1. Anytime you try to roll with a multiplier higher than the dice you have left it gives you 3 pop ups to tap x on before you can roll again. Why doesn’t it just undo the auto roll and switch to the next highest multiplier?   2. The prices on the game are ridiculous, $5 for 45 dice? I wouldn’t pay $5 for 45 real dice so idk where they’re getting these prices. I’ll pay $5 for a Whiteout Survival bundle because I feel I am getting a good value for my money for a resource that takes hours of my time to get. I can get 60 dice for free over the course of 6 hours. Why would I pay money for a free resource? They really need to step up the value of what they’re offering.   3.  Too many pop ups in general. I always get these offers popping up on screen that feel like they’re trying to sucker me out of my money with a limited time offer. I don’t care who Mr. Monopoly sends I am not going to spend money on this game.",Super fun game; way too many ads and unskippable animations
3,2023-08-06 19:09:57,"I love this game however, I suggest you do NOT spend any real money! If you can hold out until your daily bonuses and any free items the game give because once you make a purchase the game will become rigged to make you spend more money. For instance, when my multiplier is on 3x’s i somehow land on spots that give me points towards awards but when the multiplier is on 10x’s all of a sudden I land on spots that give nothing and/or spots on the board that just so happen to be right in front, between, or behind spots that give me points. The cards are also rigged in my opinion. Once you spend money the game seems to only give duplicate cards. Save your money and DO NOT purchase dice! Other than that, the game is fun!!",Would rate 5 stars… BUT
5,2023-10-06 11:56:03,I love this game like beyond normal reasons but like most people I’m broke. It would be super awesome if there could be mini games between challenges beside the token drop to gain dice or added challenge tokens when you go around the board to help players out. I know a lot of people who stopped playing because they get so close but don’t have the extra funds to purchase. Or add videos maybe for dice? Something easy but that doesn’t change the challenge of the game just a little nudge to help encouraging players to keep going when it gets stale between low money and no dice,Game ideas for creators!
4,2023-07-16 17:02:41,"It’s not bad at all it’s addicting to be honest. But you here’s something that reallllyyyy upset me. The stars that you can save up and trade for vaults w rolls and stickers in them, I saved up to 1500 stars to trade it and only got 300 rolls and 1 new sticker out of three different packs. The rest were one so already had. Pretty hard to compete sets when you can’t even get new cards you need towards the end. And also the rolls and the amount of money you get for moving onto the next board, should also be changed and go up as you progress. Or at least fill the bar at the bottom. I feel the game kind jibs you at times but overall it’s fun.",I like it but..
2,2023-06-08 13:24:50,The gameplay is actually great but they have its faults that no one is giving me answers for. In the game it states that you receive all guaranteed cards for Globe Be Trottin once you complete the tournaments and other requests. The trick is that they will send a BUNCH of duplicates instead of what’s actually needed. I posted in the trading card group about it and the ADMIN actually blocked me from the group instead of taking accountability which I despise. There are some many avenues this could’ve have been handled better. Also I reach out through chat support with no response. Now that I can’t not access the group I have no way of even trading anymore all because the truth was too strong to handle. Funny thing is multiple people agree. Customer service is everything.,Somewhat Decent
3,2023-10-31 16:52:16,"I don’t understand why we keep getting the same stickers over and over is like y’all I don’t want us to complete the albums to get the prize? I don’t like that when we finish a landmark we get the same 50 dice which is not enough and I feel like we shouldn’t have to wait a hour to receive dice when we run out, 80 dice is not enough and for every hour we have to wait for what 7 or 8 dice for it to fill up and I don’t think that’s fair and we should be able to trade gold stickers and when we do the partners for events we really need more then 5 days to complete 4 its a lot that need to changed with this game I like the game it’s just something’s need to be changed",We need a upgrade
1,2023-10-28 22:37:53,"This game was my favorite up until recently when they started young everything except for the dice you get. The events are nearly impossible. I spent over 5000 dice in one hour to not hit anything. I can’t remember the last time I got a new card or being able to open the chest fully. On top of that the cards that they give you are never 4 stars or more, meanwhile we have albums to complete that only take 4+ cards. Basically if you don’t spend money you’re not going to be able to do anything. After this event I’m deleting the app. The people running it don’t care about what the public is asking for and at this point it’s just being greedy. It’s really disappointing because all of my friends have been talking about deleting theirs after this event as well.",To win you have to spin money.
3,2023-10-28 02:29:38,"Not a complaint but an observation that really makes me question the integrity and fairness of this game. I just went through over 100 ROLLS (not counting dice but actual times I rolled) out of which I landed on corner tiles only 4 times and wheels about a handful (I did not count because I knew it would not even total a spin) anyway.. this makes absolutely no sense statistically and it’s these little tactics that may very well cause people to leave the game. The challenge is already harder, we are being bombarded with purchase offers every time we open the app, is the official play to force our hand by burning through dice so we have to buy? It’s getting weird and no longer enjoyable.",Confused and frustrated
3,2023-10-13 04:21:22,I am addicted to this game but there are some glaring problems.  The game works against you beyond belief. If you don’t buy deals you get stuck at the bottom of everything.  You can’t get the cards you need. They always give you the same cards over and over again. I’m still sitting needing the same cards for over 3 weeks. I still need the same 1 star gold card since we went to the new deck this time around.  Like I said if you don’t buy deals you get no where and even if you do you don’t get much even then.  What gives about the mega heists… I had 3 going one right after the other and in that time (approximately 45 minutes) I got 2.  And hitting the tiles you need are like pulling teeth unless you spend money.  You either get railroad tiles when you need the tokens or corner tiles or you get the tokens and corners when you need railroads.  But I noticed if you buy something you get good rolls until what you bought has run out. Then it’s back to the same old thing.  Make free p2p easier for people that can’t constantly buy deals or separate the players.,Really!?!?!?
5,2023-07-26 13:42:52,"I am the type to never bother writing a review, but this time i have to… MONOPOLY GO! IS ADDICTING!!!

I’m use to having to watch an ad mid game or click a link to watch an ad, this isn’t the case with monopoly go. there will be pop ups to buy more dice, but the game is super generous about making sure you always have something to do, it isn’t really pay to play like most games in this category.

I understand that I’m on board 95 but with me getting so few points all the time how do I still get put in these servers? For example right now I am in 31st place with 690 points and 1st place is at 7,900. Why am I having to compete with someone who is able to play all day every day when I am only able to play for a few minutes a day.

I even bought dice at time and the game malfunction. Impossible to get ahold of customer service. They also make the stickers nearly impossible to get. I’ve played for a few months now , had friends join and all and the game is definitely against you. People are selling cards instead of trading. You also can’t trade gold cards. They need to have a day “gold hour” where you can trade golds for a limited amount of time. Several people I’ve invited have quit due to not being able to actually get dice , complete the stickers etc without paying .",Fun
3,2023-07-22 12:22:35,The spending the consumers dollar isn’t the problem. I think I speak for everyone that’s interested in your product when I say that we’d gladly pour our money into your product. But the game itself is severely imbalanced. It relies to heavily on the pay to play aspect over the play and pay alternative. The play and pay model (which focuses more so on the playing aspect as opposed to the paying aspect) retains your player base for a longer period of time. We feel that the game play with more dice rolls justifies longer engagement and thus incentivizes us to pay to get ahead. No one wants to be forced to spend money in an obvious manner where you don’t even try to hide it. That’s how a great app becomes an obsolete one.,Balance

The problem I have with this game is the stickers … it seems like I’m back in the day when McDonald’s had their promotion of the Monopoly game. Everyone had multiples of the same stickers and everyone was needing the same stickers. And to my knowledge after years of promoting Monopoly through McDonald’s I have yet to hear of anyone winning anything. So, I am not as gung ho about playing the game every day as I was in the beginning. Oh, there is one more thing that is bugging me about this game… the fact that you conquer boards, and as you do, the dice amount stays the same 50 dice, but the price of everything else has gone up except the  amount of dice when you move to the next board.

Maybe more dice or a different sticker set or a roll on the wheel.  I also think we should be able to trade more than 5 stickers everyday, maybe 5 every 12 hours.

There was 10 hours left in the “Planko” tournament & 11 hours left in the “Flamingo” event. I purchased dice & Planko chips, so that I could win dice rolls for both events. Since the game was glitching & not loading, I uninstalled the app, then reinstalled it. I then logged back in with my Facebook account, just to realize all my progress was lost!

To generate maybe new cards . So i know you never really take in consideration these reviews. But I’ve talked to quite a lot of people who are now discouraged by this .

3,2023-08-06 21:18:42,I like the game don’t get me wrong but I noticed that particular stickers are extremely difficult to get to complete albums And then spending money to get the same stickers over and over again thinking you getting something you need and it becomes a waste of money and becomes a headache because it seems the only way to get new cards is to win them. Then there is the facebook trading group which is full of scammers and no help at all. There is thousands of people looking for the same to stickers( Say Cuddle and Merry Cassowary). If we are spending money to get stickers it would be nice to get stickers we need and not the stickers we already have because it’s a big waste of money.,5 star cards

If they added one card in the game as an add-on to make the game funner to give you a chance to save money and not losing money every time you go to jail and not getting the double row. One good idea is. To make it try to be original monopoly with a go to free out of jail. My great ideas you can get three cards each map like you can do with the shields you can land on chance with a? To get it and use it wisely. But if you change maps you lose it but if you land on it again and get three of them, you can get it again I hope they’re that good idea to the game",No go to jail free cards or free parking?
5,2023-05-30 06:21:12,"This game is Amazing.  Every minute that I spent playing I’m always surprised bc it’s well explained, the GRAPHIC IS SO GOOD, the quality is  beyond the expectations.  I like the fact of how they used the “album” and “daily treats” because usually that’s something that you always find in other games from the start while in this game you have to earn it.  Another good thing are the notifications, it’s has been now more than 2-3 (don’t remember well) since I own this game and the notifications are really looow.  -Sorry for any grammatical errors, it’s a little bit late and I’m typing with literally my eyes closed 😂-",WAO
5,2023-10-24 23:47:13,I am addicted to this game the only thing that really makes me slow down in playing is that I continue to get the same 1-3 star stickers! I thought this was supposed to be easier album? It’s really hard getting 4-5 star stickers let alone trade! Where players are either hoarding or all needing the same one! I do like the update with being able to trade gold cards! Just wish we could trade for the ones we need and not the selected ones but (hey better than nothing)! Getting goals without spending money is really hard but my goal is to finish 1 album!,Great game
4,2023-05-27 22:24:46,"i think this game is super fun and it looks rly nice but the only problem i personally have w the game that a lot of ppl can agree with is how annoying it is on having to wait. every hour you only get 5 rolls…it sort of loses the fun of the game because you only get like 3 minutes of enjoyment. for them to attract more customers they need to make it so we aren’t waiting for an hour to pass in order to play. i think the concepts (game, albums, rewards, etc) are super engaging but the way we have to wait in order to engage in these activities is annoying. they could definitely have a bigger audience if the game didn’t rely so heavily on time.",Love this game!!!!
3,2023-11-05 16:37:37,"This game was really fun in the beginning, but as you progress it’s just a hassle. Everything goes up as you progress which is expected but the “rewards” stay the same. It now costs almost 1.5 billion, yes BILLION for me to upgrade my landmarks to get to the new board, but the reward…still just 50 measly dice rolls. My bail amount at this point is around $473,000 and still just 50 dice rolls for new boards. Also cards, ugh don’t get me started on the cards! I’ve had the same ones for almost 2 weeks now despite winning 2 tournaments. I’m over it, the fun is gone.

It takes 10 hours to fill back up to 80 dice and if you want to buy that amount it’s anywhere between $3 and $4 dollars. That lasts for maybe 10 minutes of play! I saved dice for weeks for a big game coming up to try and win the stickers I needed and burned through 3,000 dice in one day and didn’t even come close to finishing one car! Either they need to make the dice packs more affordable or shorten the regeneration time or both! I don’t want to have to spend $49 for a dice pack of 1,500 and still not comers an event or win the stickers I need!

Some you get 15 times and others never, until they offer it for you to buy. It’s not randomized at all, they are purposely trying to get you to spend more money. Additionally, they refer you to their Facebook group from the game and then everyone gets scammed in the group. You cannot promote something in which people get scammed. I also didn’t receive my bonus in the Toy Maker Marathon and when I emailed them about it, they didn’t even bother to respond.

To get less play then I get for FREE ON MY OTHER GAMES! Once you build up on the board levels, they make it more expensive to buy and build properties!

Secondly, the tournaments we be playing is a bit much, I would have played about five hundred dice just for seven hundred. The wheel of fortune game needs to be updated to something worth having!

3,2023-09-01 13:41:57,I loveee monopoly go! It’s easily became my favorite game. BUT we need more dice rolls. 50 dice every new board isn’t enough when the cost of your properties increase with every new level.  The last album that just ended two days ago seemed to be rigged as well. Monopoly is a game of luck and chance. How is it that NO ONE received any new stickers for the last week of the the last album but there was an option to pay $20 to get the cards you were currently missing?? I think this game could use a lot more improvement if they want us to continue playing. If I don’t finish this neww album I’m uninstalling. I’m not spending money on a game that’s suppose to be based on chance.,We need more chances at dice rolls!
1,2023-08-31 20:21:39,This game’s algorithm is in desperate need of change. No way should people be completing collections 3 or 4 times while others need just one sticker to complete their first round. Especially if they have spent $$ on the game to increase their chances of getting the final sticker needed. And never getting a response back from customer service is unacceptable especially when screenshots are provided.  Update: Tried contacting support again multiple times after receiving a response from one of the developers asking me to do so. Guess what. NO RESPONSE from anyone again. Not even after again providing screenshots. Including today after getting game error crash 3 times resulting in the loss of 150 dice and having to rebuild the same building 3 times. Wish I had all the $$$ back that I stupidly spent on this game.,Skewed Algorithm

To me it seems to use those who never spend money to keep the people who do spend money motivated by allowing the people who don’t spend to complete the events…. Also during the glitch I’ve wrote customer service to report issues I had and don’t receive any feed back but again, diluting the glitch my friends received 250 dice and a pink card pack… Just play it as a game and don’t spend your cash, it’s not worth it",Scam Game

If the board costs go up, so should the roll payouts when you move up in levels. There is no way 50 rolls is enough after advancement in such high levels. The daily rewards are super low and the spin table payouts are way beyond trash when you collect 3 properties. Why is 5 rolls even on that darn spin table? Make it make since. We need rolls. And the wait time for rolls is ridiculous. I’m up to 8 rolls per hour now and that’s trash. Why does roll regeneration even have to be won? This should be a given. Why not 10-15 roll’s every 30 minutes. The higher the level the more rolls should be payed out. Fix the problem. Please and thank you.",Great game but needs some work.
3,2023-08-07 00:54:24,"I’ve been playing this game for months now and I love it but the only flaw is the trading system. Facebook is a good idea and all but the amount of times I have been scammed along with countless other people is atrocious. A trading system through the actual app would solve this issue so easily and effectively. Have it to where the players can swap their cards fluently without the thought of being scammed crossing through their minds. Trading through Facebook comes with the risk of not receiving the right card or any card at all, and then you lose that one card that you have been saving up for a long time.

5,2023-11-04 21:14:45,It’s a fun game if you like to continuously get f**cked over on stickers because people rip you off and don’t get their accounts shut down or penalized. Such an easy fix if they cared. They’re more worried about their money then the player bases happiness with the game. All it would take is to have a trade option instead of just sending. One where both parties have to agree an lock in their trades. Plenty of games have done this it’s not that hard. Unfortunately all the people behind the app care only about money and maintaining outrageous prices for VIRTUAL dice rolls.,Toxic players with no penalty

Being someone with ADHD, seeing the game this way with all the times I have to click “collect” makes it very annoying. I’d like a setting for it to collect for you and possibly a x2 or skip for some animations.  The other thing I want to say is that my friend was far ahead of me in the game. She had it connected to her apple account and when she switched phones it never allowed her to log back in. She refuses to play the game now since all that progress was lost.

When you enter tournaments as soon as they start the top positions are already so far out of reach because they are either cheating or spending a ton of money to take those top positions. The partner events are getting much harder as well, each one takes more and more points to win.  The last two I competed in were the toy challenge and the spooky car event.

My biggest issue? It’s glitchy (sent my partner two gifts of 400 tokens which they NEVER received), there is no way to report any issues with the game (but you CAN report other players … wait, what?), and lastly myself and many others have noted where the game is quite obviously fixed.

I got ONE new card. Not even worth it. I expect finishing sticker packs with higher stars is supposed to be hard. But not impossible. 8 dice per hour isn’t xeap when events last 24 hours most of the time. It’s like the devs don’t understand if you  give people 80 dice per hour and they start to actually get ahead they’re more likely to buy dice bc the prizes are actually obtainable. It’s like a cat with a toy. If the cat never catches the toy he will stop playing. But if he thinks he can win. He’ll keep trying. Annnd they capped me after 3 fb friends joined instead of at 10 like they say. I’d suggest don’t even start playing.,Ugh. Worst customer service.

The only downsides in my opinion, are the repetitive boards, not getting enough dice, and the sticker/card issue.   The boards and dice go hand and hand. If you don’t have enough dice, you’re not able to accumulate the money. If you don’t have the money, you can’t upgrade anything for a while. When the board is complete, you only receive 50 dice and a couple mil even though you rolled hundreds, if not thousands of dice and spent upwards to a couple billion. The compensation should increase as you upgrade through the boards.   The sticker/card issue seems to be the biggest pain in my opinion. I’m on the trading page on Facebook and everyone seems to not be getting the same 10-20ish cards. I understand they’re probably rare, but if it’s constant with thousands of people, there needs to be some changes.   I’m sad to say it’s getting pretty boring.

Total rip off, it feels like monopoly go stole my dream vacation that I paid for them mailed me back a post card that said “wish you were here.  Wish I could get all the money back I invested after the game steals it with their glitches. Their so called apologies are like 70 dice and a little money…. They let scammers steal your stickers and tell you to report it.., then give you nothing for your troubles.

I got no money graphics and no money went into the chest. I rolled again and landed on chance which brought up a railroad card. I clicked the card and it didn’t take me to the nearest railroad. I rolled once more and landed on a scroll token. The token flashed and disappeared without giving me the 40 points (20 multiplier). I closed out the game and restarted. Seems to be ok for now.

That being said  We noticed the new bundle has different prices for the both of us. I have spent money in game and I think that may be the reasoning. If that’s the case i would strongly suggest having all the options available for each bundle. It feels like I’m being taken advantage of in these cases. Everyone knows the only thing we are after is the NEW guaranteed card pack, yet you fluff it up with more rolls and money but bump the price 30+$?!

1,2023-10-23 17:32:03,"Rant:  I’m starting to think Monopoly Go! is completely rigged. Not even questionable IMO at this point.. I’ve spent some money on this game and the times I do, the rolls go more in favor of what the “quests” require. But when I don’t, they miss much more frequently. Then if I have a week we’re I’ve spent a few bucks, then I’m placed in a tournament where the first place finisher has 60,000 or more points when I’ve got 20,000 points which 80% of the time would be a first place finish. For example, I’m in 10th place right now with over 24k points when I was in the 3rd just last night before bed and the closest person to me was 9k points. I’m fixing to delete the game altogether with this.. it’s getting to be overly blatant that there is some sort of algorithm doing this with the amount of statistical improbability I’ve been experiencing..   Another example, I had more than 2k rolls in the game and was simply trying to complete my daily mission of getting a bank heist. It took me nearly or more than 50 rolls in order to get it.. That’s statistically improbable given that there are 7 opportunities to be able to gain a bank heist..   Is anyone else feeling this way?",Algorithm and bots theory.

They have the error of giving repeated cards. Today I deleted the game and that's why I decided to do it. I've spent money here and the game never gives me gold cards! No matter how much I play and stay number 1 in tournaments, it never gives me the cards I need. I have 1,500 cards and they are all repeated! And they are 1, 2 or 3 Star so it's not a great game to get people's money! Isn't it funny you never win!

While yes, paying money makes you advance faster, it’s not a necessity if you don’t mind taking your time. It’s fun to hop on once or twice a day and use your rolls. There are a variety of interchanging events and tournaments that cycle through to keep things interesting.  The only thing I would change is either increase the amount of rolls received per hour, or reduce the waiting time to receive more rolls. Otherwise, no complaints!","Fun, easy, paying money not necessary."
3,2023-08-30 05:46:57,So I started playing this game and the fun thing was trying to get the cars. You don’t give enough dices especially when you are getting to new levels. When you get the card it’s all duplicates and when you exchange them it’s still the same cards. It makes you not want to play this game. I didn’t even play for a full week and the most dice was 270. You should be able to buy dices with the money you earn! You should get more dices when you do the wheel spin.5 or 15 is not even worth getting. It’s like a tease for us. When you exchange the cards you should get a card you need! IT’s frustrating and makes you not want to play anymore.,Dices and cards is ridiculous

I wanted the 70 Peg-E chips because I was close to reaching the 350 rolls mark, which is more than the 250 that a second “purchase” provided.

2,2023-08-18 14:30:57,"This is how you create in game trading: when a person receives a duplicate sticker, there should be a notification saying “Post to Trade?” If the person chooses yes, the in game trade screen opens and you have all the albums lined up. From there, they can scroll through and click on which sticker they need and the game simultaneously posts the sticker they are trading. That way, everyone who wants to trade has access to this screen to see what’s out there and what they can grab. The catch is, you have to select to trade. You can’t just go into it freely without posting a trade. Also if you select yes to trade, you get the option to choose what you want to post to trade or the game will choose for you.

2,2023-07-14 00:47:30,I enjoy playing this game I even play it with my friends and some family members. The only thing that I have issues is I have one certain player that constantly attacks me up to 10 times a day every day trying to shut down properties that is just a little bit overboard   I have even reported this obsessed behavior and get no response. I get it you go shut down someone and they get revenge and go on but not him. He has been so obsessive shutting down my properties. The other issue that I have is that the cards get you tried to finish a albums and all you get is repeats.   I have gotten 172 repeats I can’t get any of the cards that I need to complete my albums. Can you even finish getting them at all? I have no idea.,Enjoy playing a few downsides

Others with 40k seen their partners contributions at 0 but screenshots say otherwise, they actually contributed 40k themselves.

Well no it didn’t. Now everything works however it won’t let me touch ANYTHING on the screen. So I have not been able to play my game for over a week now. You can’t reach out to customer support for help because the link is phony and only takes you to Q&As which does absolutely nothing to help me.

4,2023-04-29 13:29:16,"It’s fun game through and through but the only issues I have with it are the 5 rolls every hour need to be turn up to 10 or 15 with the amount of content, and also the absolute amount of duplicate stickers for only 15-28 rolls (of which I averaged 17 rolls for my 100 stars) it would help to either tune up the rolls coming out of the sticker boxes or even tweak the odds for duplicates a bit lower to help get a little bit better of a fighting chance for the final sets of cards that can’t be traded amongst players. Other than those two things I have a blast but it could be way more fun to play when we can play it more.  -Schmythical",Needs more rolls…
4,2023-04-28 13:10:44,The game itself is actually pretty cool and the cost for upgrades are actually also kind of balanced. But it takes 10 hours for 50 dice to refill and 10 minutes to waste them. Do the math and fix that before your game becomes boring. I love to play this game but I wouldn’t mind deleting it because I’m waiting 10 hours for dice that don’t help me progress enough. And yes I’m an active player but why should I be when I get only 50 dice and then have to wait almost half a day to get more that’s wack to be honest. If you can find a way to give players more dice on a daily base the game would be so much more enjoyable.,Could be wayyy better

If you’re playing the game the right way you never land on anything or use when the dice multiplier is high and when it’s low you do land on things but it’s not worth anything. You have made it impossible to finish these albums even if you do buy stickers. I have gotten over 1000 stickers in the past few weeks and none of them were new stickers. People have hacked this game and have over an infinite amount of dice that also gives us no chance in the events.

2,2023-10-30 15:44:28,I actually use to enjoy the game but I feel the developers have gotten a wee bit greedy. I spent way too much money on this game since the last new set of stickers came out just to NOT have won by now. The bots steal way to much of your money meanwhile you can only do heist on people your friends with. Seems highly unfair to the monopoly go players. Also the amount repeat stickers you get without getting any new ones are frustrating. The amount of dice and prizes you win doesn’t seem like it’s worth the value for completing sets especially given how hard it is to even complete them. Lastly the amount of ads before you and start playing if very annoying. I hope next reset they make it fair.,"What use to be, isn’t anymore"

The stickers are a joke. Instead of giving you stickers that you actually need you will get dups of the same cards over and over again. And don’t even bother using FB groups most are scams or people wanting cards and never sending you anything.   I don’t know what it is but it seems like when there is a tournament you will start going to Jail and landing on Community Chest back to back it’s ridiculous.   Saving Stars for a Safe ? Smh they still gave me a bunch of dups you may get a 4-5 star sticker but 9 times out of 10 its nothing that you will need to finish a set.

Can’t get anywhere near the top in the tournaments anymore. Can’t even get far in the little events either because it never lands on what you’re supposed to land on. All of the gold stickers I get are duplicates. Not to mention I haven’t even gotten ONE four or five star gold yet this album.

Where you team up with four people. Each of us a team of two. Won some dice and some money. AWESOME!?!?  NOT!!!! Now, as soon as you win a lot of dice, all of the sudden, the multiplyer pops up. That’s where you roll the dice and multiply it buy 200,300,500 depending on how many dice you have.   I had 5000 dice I won,I rolled!  I find it very ironic. Normally I can have 2 to 3Billion in money account and I’m never bankrupt. That day I rolled and won 35 billion. I built up my little cities and stopped,so I could go back to work.  I had 23 billion left. By the time I got off work -four hours later, I was bankrupt.  It seems the bigger the bank account,the more they go after you and make it so people can attack you. The smaller your account,you don’t get touched.  I’m not the only one that noticed this-since they encourage us to form groups. We chit chat and discuss.

1,2023-09-20 02:58:01,Don’t get this game. The developers are money hungry. They’re finding all the ways to stop people from getting free dice and trying to force them to spend lots of money on the game. They don’t even worry about responded when you send reports about actually game bugs like the multiplier not working when you land on chance. They have all the time in the world to make sure you don’t have any rolls to properly enjoy the game unless you’re rich. Everyone in all the Facebook groups are talking about striking or deleting the game. So t waste your time. It starts out fun and then you see the greed of the developers.

The collecting the stickers part is fun because you can trade your doubles with friends but when You get to the gold stickers you can’t trade those and those are needed to finish the stickers event , only problem is  if your paying for the game and buy some sticker packs you’ll end up with doubles and triples and more of the same card you can’t trade away.

When you get into the game, you’ll realize that it’s not like all of those game out that let you just play for a very short amount of time before you ether have to pay to keep playing after a few minutes or wait out cool down times. All just to frustrate you into paying out $. This is my fist day playing and I have been playing non stop for 5 hours. I wish there were more games like this that give a product that makes you want to spend money on the game because it’s worth it. Nice job!!",Great game!
2,2023-10-02 22:02:08,"It was fun at first, but it gets extremely repetitive after playing for a while. Once you get past a certain point, the boards are the same old ones, and it takes forever to get enough money to pay/upgrade a property. If there aren't going to be new boards every level, I would prefer a rebirth option at a certain point where you can get more rolls or more money from the rebirth.   Also, some of the rewards from the different events are pointless. One example, i got Mega Heist for 15 minutes, but each time I landed on a railroad, I only got Shutdowns for 5-6 times in a row. There's been so many times where the Mega Heist reward will expire before getting to use it at all. This seems like a coding flaw",Was fun at first
4,2023-08-26 03:34:51,"Overall cool n neat game. Playing with friends is great. A couple of things could be looked into… 1. Advancing to next board should come with increased dice, dollar amount and sticker packs should be added. As the higher you go the more it costs to build your landmarks, utilities, taxes and getting out of jail. 2. A day during the week or a window during the day we should be able to trade gold cards 3. We have friends we like and want to help with dice. We should be able to trade them amongst one another. 4. Increase card trades per day. 7-10 is better than 5 5. Dice/stickers packs are extremely too expensive, please lower them. We shouldn’t be punished for being on higher levels than others. 6. Lastly find away to retrieve scammed stickers back. We work hard for them. Sadly I traded in pink vault received 1 5⭐️sticker that was a dup. Tried to use it as a barging chip to get the last sticker i needed (magni-pheasant) and was scammed. Took a wk and half later to finally get it to complete my album.",Needs Tweaking

I had one cake left to finish and next thing I know the tournament is over. And another thing is the “stickers,” that I may win or roll the dice to win, its ALWAYS the same stickers that I have. I have 8 in total of the same different stickers, rather it’s a pink, blue, or green package that I may open. I even traded my stickers in for rewards that’s in the treasure box and got stuck with stickers that I once again already have.

They lure you in letting you play for an hour or more early on, then they severely limit the times you can play without buying more moves.  It’s not even a game, as it really plays itself.  You’re just clicking the ok button over and over.  One or two things let you click to speed up the animation, but most of them won’t.  It could be fun if you could just play it mindlessly at will, but when you run out of moves, it pops up not one,  or two, not three, but most of the time four or five different windows with more “offers” to purchase more.

1,2023-08-31 15:19:06,"The game started off fun in the beginning, but the deeper you get into the game the more you realize they’re cheating. If you have a minimum amount of rolls, they’ll make sure they eat them up so you’ll possibly spend real money by you constantly landing on community chest, visiting jail and free parking. But when there’s an event on free parking all of a sudden the odds of you landing there significantly drop. They don’t give out certain stickers, but will issue out a bunch of the same ones so it’s impossible to complete the entire sticker event. They take more money from you than how much the person that did the heist on you actually received. My daughter did a heist on me for around $200,000 but they lied and notified me that she got me for 1.4mil… This game could’ve been great if it was honest.","It’s definitely rigged, not randomized"
1,2023-08-29 17:56:28,"This game was fun at the beginning but once you hit a certain point you realize it’s pretty much not sustainable. You go up in levels and things just become more expensive.

The packs don’t give you anything but 1 and 2 star stickers. You can land on free parking every time around the board as long as it has nothing to give you. If you want to land on free parking you could go through 1000 dice without landing on it once.

I’ve spent money for dice, packs, etc and ended up with nothing. You have to wait forever to get any dice, and when you do finally get them the game is set up in a way that you only land on useless spots or tax spots. Unless you want to spend all your savings on a game that has no real reward, this is a dumb download. I don’t see it being very successful for long. Although, they are doing what was intended. Which is to get thousands of people to spend the money they work hard to get for nothing from the game. One of the worst games I’ve played in a long time. Sad part is, it could have been very successful long term if they weren’t so greedy. 🤷‍♀️",Just don’t.
5,2023-08-13 16:29:34,This monopoly game is super fun while you get you the roll your dice is in earn your money to build your city. You get rewards for doing stuff you can break peoples houses to get your money to build more of your city. Every time you build more city and more city in buildings you can move up to a different city say I was in France. I could move up to Paris and it is a great opportunity to get the fun things on your phone and just play by yourself because regular Wii monopoly is a multiple people game but this game on your phone is very fun for one person on your phone. Bye have a great day.,Monopoly
3,2023-08-17 03:11:39,"I love the game but a few things need to be addressed. The number of dice you receive should go up significantly with each board you complete, just like the nail does. Also, there should be a new sticker in every pack. Can we do a dice grab like we do a cash grab? Can we choose random people to do a bank heist from just like we can when we do a shut down? sticker trading should be in the game not on FB where people get scammed out of their stickers where we can report it if they don’t follow through on the trade. More random boards, one of them are starting to look alike. Can we get the option to donate dice to a friend as well. I think these few tweaks would make it awesome.",Can be a great game.

There’s no need to show all of these different deals that the game has each and every time. If I want to know what deals the game has. I’ll look at it myself in the store.  Same goes for whenever I run out of dice to roll or if I’m very low on rolls. I don’t need a reminder that I can get more every time. I can visually see I need more rolls, and therefore I will get more rolls from the store.  I love the game, don’t get me wrong. Just needs some adjustments. Please fix this issue.",To Many Pop Ups

However after 24 hours of having the game I started getting messages cussing at me and yelling at me for in game play and being told I was purposely targeting the other player. So I set my game up for deactivation. Three days later I get an email saying my account wasn’t verified because I was not the account holder….very confused because I am the account holder. I’m not smart enough to hack a game and steal an account lol if I was I would have deleted the other persons account who was being rude over a game. The reason my account wasn’t verified was because the amount of currency I had in the game when I set up for deactivation was no longer the same three days later. I wonder why, it must have something to do with the game that steals money! Fun times!",Disgusted
1,2023-07-16 23:38:56,First I want to say that this game could be amazing but it is set up only to make you spend money to buy die. They only give you a few die an hour and the more die you roll at once the higher the rewards you get special rewards when you land on railroads. When I am only rolling 3 die at a time I land on railroads all the time. I had some die and was rolling twenty at a time and I landed on the railroads once. That is one example but that’s how the game plays. You get so close to a reward so you buy die but then never land on anything. And don’t get me started on the stickers. There are people who have finished sets twice when most of us are struggling to complete it once. When you have die the game is a lot of fun but he prepared to spend a ton of money if you actually want to play it much.,Don’t download this game
1,2023-06-05 23:57:10,"I love the game, I really do. The only problem is the sticker collection. Swapping extra stars for accumulated cards for a small amount of dice is ok but what I would really really REALLY like to see the developers add is an option to buy card packs with left over coins.   Trading cards is nearly impossible because people either want money or impossible stars or the cards needed for trading are so rare that no one has them. I wish the developers could just watch the trade groups and actually see what other people have to go through just to try and trade. That’s not including the amount of other bad players scamming during card trades and now you have upset players stuck without the card they need, upset players wanting to quit because of it.

3,2023-05-13 18:02:25,"I think the game is very solid and addicting but the  issue that makes the game not a 5/5 is just the fact that dice are way more rare than they should be, that’s it, there are ways to get dice but as you get farther the amount of dice you get doesn’t increase and that is a major flaw and makes me and my family not want to grind the game as much. Waiting an hour for 5 dice is rediculous, having a hotel spin and getting 15 dice is a joke, there are ways to make the net worth correlates to increased amount of dice.  Please increase the amount of dice we can get from playing and the money people will spend will come, don’t starve us, feed us and we will spend more!",Good game but progression could be better
2,2023-11-10 21:46:07,"My biggest gripe with this game is that your token doesn’t get sent back to the actual jail/just visiting space. If you land on Go to Jail, you get caged on that square and you roll doubles or pay to get out, but you keep moving forward from there rather than getting sent back to the jail/just visiting corner.   Besides this annoying detail, the game gets really repetitive and mundane after a while. It’s highly addicting and makes you want to spend cash to keep rolling, but then you realize you’re working for nothing except to get through the different locations on the map. Not an exciting reward if you ask me.   If you get hotels on your color set, the hotels all disappear after you land on your complete hotel property and collect rent for the first time. You spin the wheel to get a mediocre prize for getting a color set and then you start all over again to get houses and hotels on those properties.   So mindless after a while.

Thirdly, the payout for completing a board you only get 50 dice when you have to spend so many days in order to complete that board just doesn’t seem fair.

I’ve played like crazy and haven’t gotten a new card in over 3 weeks. And then, they offer a one time gold card trade, but there’s only one card you can trade/receive. It’s a joke.

The tournaments are stupidly competitive to the point where people are so high up on the leaderboards you literally can’t compete. The game isn’t enjoyable like that. The purple gold 5 star packs are unattainable this way. That’s why I have every card except for those. Therefore this game is lacking content to get those cards.

When the mega heist is activated and I land on it, they give me a chance to win regular heist amounts instead of mega heist, this has happened on numerous occasions. I have complained about this to them but all they ever say is they will investigate and will respond in 5 days. They never so. While this game was fun, I’m slowly but surely losing interest.

Bots are attacking players and taking $$$ and destroying boards (evidence from multiple parents whose kids are asleep and don’t even have their phones to play, let alone repeatedly attack). The game designers put a gold card in every set (dupes are not tradeable) to encourage purchase of dice and special packs in order to complete albums. It’s a clear cash grab and players are dropping like flies.  Not only that, secondary businesses have emerged where players are selling cards for real money on eBay and other platforms. The game designers are grifting people at this point, and rather than designing things to prevent monetizing the game by external players they’re actually incentivizing a secondary market. The harder it becomes to progress and more they restrict things in the game, the bigger this “black market” thing becomes.  Loosen up on the dice. The formula was already winning. Lower odds of receiving certain cards but make it easier to collect and roll for packs. Leaving players to trade in duplicates to obtain needed cards.

If dice were easier to get I’d play it more but I’m constantly sitting at 0 dice so I can’t really do much.

You spend a little here and there and the next thing you know you dropping some heavy money so you can collect the stickers and dice to win bigger prizes. The fact that you don’t get enough dice to move ahead is crazy. Not to mention the higher you move in the map the more expensive it costs to upgrade the landmarks. The only way to get ahead is to spend your actual money which to me is not that fun. Y’all should try giving more free dice as you move farther along on the map.

Not to sound like a sore loser but it really seems like I completely wasted my money and time. So I would say don’t even spend a dime on this game and just let your rolls reload on their own cus you’ll spend money on a package and end up losing and having to waste the rolls you just bought getting what you just lost back, which is such a headache and lame. Oh and always spend your money the moment you can. They should really cap the heists just like they do the breakdowns and shorten the roll reload time.",Feels like a waste
3,2023-06-08 04:35:55,I really would give the game a four ⭐️in enjoyment itself. I do really enjoy playing the game.   However I just want to stress the annoyance of the pop ups that come after you run out of dice. There is like six “advertisements” for you to spend actual money within the game that you have to exit out of each time you run out of dice. You can have these presets to multiple your winnings by using that number of dice but if you have it set to x3 and only have x2 dice left then you get six pop ups jumping out to you and then you can roll again and then againnnn you have the six pop ups come back. Hopefully is something that is easily adjustable.,Annoying Pop ups
4,2023-10-08 18:41:09,I like this game because I can defeat people like family and friends. It is also something I play in the car when there is no internet. But I have a few questions and things I would like. Do you add protection are is it there and always have been there? That’s my only question lol. I would like you to add people’s contacts name under there name in the game so we know who it is. I don’t want ask people if it’s them. That’s my only request. Instead of the request and the question I like the game. Especially when I have nothing else to do. Thank you for taking your time to read this message!,I like it
3,2023-10-04 02:11:41,"It was pretty fun and engaging until I hit the point where I’d either either need to wait for more rolls, or pay for more rolls. I figured that would be at the third city, about half way through the upgrades I could purchase. I was spot on. It has the animation quality as advertised. It’s colorful and bouncy. Has that addictive bubbly movement. Audio is only so-so, which really has to stand out for me to stick with a game. The major issue is that the game offers too fast of a play speed right off the bat that I feel like rolls that I could buy would vanish too quickly. Had a good time until I ran out of rolls but didn’t feel invested enough to wait or pay.",Hits a Wall
3,2023-10-03 00:55:45,"When I started playing, it was slow. It picked up the more I learned how to use my dice to better play the game. I got to where I was almost winning tournaments. I won the cake tournament but never got my prize because they ended it before I could click on my leveled up cake. I was really upset at that. Customer support was no help. I just wanted my 5k dice. I poured my whole game into that tournament and I’m still a little disappointed they never got me the dice I earned. It was a really hard blow on my wanting to play. Eventually I got the game again and played with my family. The changes they made recently are upsetting but I’m glad I have something my whole family can enjoy.",It’s ok
1,2023-10-03 14:30:08,I’ve noticed a few shady things like when you land on a shield with a x 10 multiple instead of getting 20 dice back you get 8. But this shady thing is outright infuriating. Currently there is the Octoberfest competition going on and I am sitting at 1772 dresses which puts me in 11th place the big issue is that I have video proof that any new dresses I get from landing on train are not adding to my total which means I am being screwed out of a higher prize. There is no way to actually contact customer service and I have spent money on the game which is why this is so infuriating. You force us to play a game with in app purchases and you might make a couple of pitches to help get you higher in a competition but then screw you over by doing shady things.,Shady payouts when you are not paying attention.
3,2023-09-29 17:46:27,"I like the game don’t get me wrong, however the constant pop ups to buy dice are ridiculous. These need to be only at the beginning or not there at all. If I want to buy something I am more than capable of going into a store on the side to do so. Also it is stupid that you keep getting the same stickers over and over, but never the ones you need to finish a pack. I have a friend group that would trade, but we all need the same stickers. I tried joining your Facebook trading group and it is filled with scammers and people who don’t give stickers back in agreed trades. The admins on the page don’t seem to care either.

I don’t buy extra dice (I probably would if I wasn’t broke) but there are plenty of freebies especially when you invite friends to play. The trick is to let your dice max out, then use them all betting 3 or higher. Save your builds for when you have enough money to complete the entire board and boom! 50 more dice rolls. Keep it up. You’ll win some tournaments and lose some because it is after all a game. A very addictive game. Hope this helps",Don’t have to pay to play

And I’ve spent money on the game before and they gave nothing but dupes they are trying to run you broke just to have a chance to play for more than two minutes. And what I really want to know is why they are trying to sell me a purple pack combo for $100 and charging other players $30? My best guess is because I’ve already spent money on they game they figure they can up charge.,They rigged the game

2,2023-08-25 14:46:04,My Friend introduced me to this game and it’s fun but I have an issue with the bots they send to steal 95% of your money in an attempt to more than likely get you to spend real money in the shop. Yesterday I played for hours. I acquired 300 million + dollars. I stopped playing and today I get a notification that 295 million dollars was just stolen in a bank heist. This person isn’t even on my friends list so how did they even get to do a mega heist for my money? This has happened to me multiple times by people who aren’t on my friends list. I think it’s a really bad attempt by developers of this game to get you to spend real money in this game. I’m thinking of quitting eventually because it’s annoying to have to keep starting over.,The Game is Fun But…
3,2023-08-20 01:58:15,"At first I love how interactive this game is and how it involves us making new friends. However, Monopoly makes it where the players all needs the same card which makes it harder and makes players spend tons of money.   Having put in so much money into an app and not receiving the stickers you need to complete sounds surreal to me. I invested time and money and many of my friends have as well, they make you spend more and guarantee you a “4 star card.”   However, after spending it you might not get the ones you need. For example, spending $50 on some dices, money, and a pack of guarantee 4 star stickers… that’s right not stickers STICKER.. and turns out you don’t need it. Such a bummer. Sorry monopoly you’ve been scamming way too many people, and the users will soon realize what you’re doing. Once users starts deleting the app and not playing with it anymore, that’s when you’ll want to try and recover your mistakes. I’m sorry but it’ll be too late, you’re being greedy now and however you’re not thinking about the future.   DELTING THIS APP.",SCAM

5,2023-07-25 16:33:08,"This is an amazing game! It’s a very fun reimagined version of Monopoly that’s easy to pick up and become addicted. Only problem is the slow rewards animations. When I claim a reward an entire screen with fireworks shows up and it happens for every single reward I claim. It really slows down the gameplay for a game that was meant to be fast paced. When I press claim it should just trigger the reward animations and show it going to its respective widget on the screen. All this to say, removing that one fireworks screen from the claim rewards sequence would make the game flow better.",Fun but still slow

The characters are cute and the rivalry across the social aspect of the game definitely adds to its charm. It’s a really fun game but it somewhat reminds me of gambling in some of the mechanics. If you have suffered or are currently suffering with this level of addiction I would highly caution playing this game. There are in-app purchases, deals, and upgrades that can be purchased. Just don’t get stuck in the game.",Really fun game but be careful TW: Addiction

3,2023-07-05 13:14:41,"So the game is fun, yes. But a few issues come in once you’ve been playing for a while and deal with trades/friends list.  I have people that I have added as friends or added me as friends by clicking my link on Facebook, (which is why I only will do it DM’s moving forward.) The issue is how trades operate, and how easy it is to send a sticker, to not have the other send one back. That is the state this game is in, and needs to be worked on. I don’t want to have to go to Facebook to be able to trade, it should be in house. The excuse of cost, ability is the company not giving the game devs the resources needed for this game to maximize profit.   Also, not being able to remove then people that have added you, or you eventually would wish to remove as friends would be nice.  And finally, gold stickers being unable to trade but you can have multiple copies of? Not a good feeling to have, and not a great game design AT ALL!

I get that the developers need to profit, but you should throw a bone to the ones who grind and play everyday even if they don’t pay. At least stop giving the same gold cards over and over again. I haven’t gotten even a regular new card in weeks and I play everyday. I really hope the next time the album resets they change it back to the way it was with the previous album.

This might not be a big problem but you get way too little cash from landing to different tiles and landing to attack and steal is luck based. You can get gifts of diced but it’s not even close to completing 1/4 of the board beyond board 1 because of the dramatic increased amount of upgrades per building. And when you get unlucky you can’t even advance your board even when you have 2 building upgrades left because you’re guaranteed to get attacked(have to fix building for cash) without spending real money. This game is good visually but is too slow and I recommend other games like Board king as it’s way faster and more satisfying.",Too slow
3,2023-11-11 02:26:23,I love this game but there could be some adjustments made like the trading the game needs to put something in place for both parties to agree on the trade before it’s made I have been scammed idk how many time out of cards which makes it even harder to complete at set or album. Also the amount of dice per hour needs to be a lot more especially when u get to the higher levels. The tournaments I feel are not fair because people are hacking the system and getting thousands of dice and they make it impossible to place in the tournaments to win the cards we need. The game is fun but adjusting some things would make it better,Need for some changes to the game
2,2023-10-23 18:49:54,It use to be fun now not so much. Putting a gold card in every album to make it harder. Giving only 1 star cards and to open a box is 2500 points! That takes way to long and for very little dice. This is why people are scamming just so they can get dice. Once you buy a package then next the packages are to pricy! Why am I gonna pay 100 dollars for 3200 dice?! 100 dollars is tooooo much to spend on a game! You need to make packages more affordable. 3200 dice is nothing to how fast it goes and you barely get anything from it. Made the game to hard and I am losing interest in playing. If it doesn’t start changing I am deleting. The last album set wasn’t to bad. Now your just being very greedy!,Not wanting to play anymore
3,2023-09-19 22:03:45,I feel as though this is a great game but waiting an hour for 8 dice is not worth it. That would mean you would need to wait 10hrs+ just to fill your dive bar up. I love everything else about the game except the dice because the higher you go into the game the 8dice an hr is not worth it. I can say buying dove will help but you really have to buy dove to get anywhere in the game. I also feel like when it comes to opening the chest that they should let you pick more than 1 person to open the chest. Yes it has about 9 or more people up there but the most I will get is 2 people opening my chest which isn’t fair if we have more than 2 people up there.,More dice
2,2023-10-01 03:10:12,"I love this game. But its all starting to feel like pay to win very quickly. Unless theres something i missed, you cannot win tournaments or the daily events without having to buy dice. Dice regenerate really slow, and its all luck whether or not you land the on the spaces to get the pieces for events. I just don't feel like paying 100 dollars for 3000 dice that will be gone in less than 3 minutes with a 50/50 chance of it going to work in my favor.

Give me a break.. oh and 25 dice free a day doesn’t make a difference in the game. This has to be the worst game out there. Scopely has better luck in Yahtzee than this one. At least their other games get fixed and have better chances and results than this one. They don’t listen to their own players with this game. Instagram has all kinds of negative comments on their feed and no response to anyone. The only way to win is to buy from them…. Has this company looked at the economy lately? 100% no they haven’t.

The whole thing is very frustrating so I went from a five on the approval rating down to one because this is a time waster and I do not recommend this game to anyone and regret that I spent a dime purchasing dice to play this game, not knowing that that was a whole object in the first place.

They also have cheats to shut off the internet (dev A and airplane mode) to game and cheat to get really high scores in the tournaments which makes others playing correctly not even have a chance. It is really a scam and really sad because it could be a great game. Shame on Scoply for valuing money alone. They should give more dice and not withhold cards unless you buy a pack.

What I Don’t like about this is that you have limited rolls. Once you run out of rolls there’s really nothing to do, and you have to wait 1 HOUR just to get 5 rolls.

Buy a pack for 2.99. Load up the app? Buy a pack for 9.99. Run out of dice and can’t play until they’re recharged? Buy a pack for 2.99.

For the first time ever I actually spent money on a mobile game. Since the sticker album reset the game just isn’t fun anymore. I went from playing half the day to playing maybe 10 mins a day. Way too hard to get dice now, and even harder to get stickers. Every sticker pack I get that has a gold is a repeat. I haven’t got a new sticker in over 3 weeks. Not to mention the dice prizes for each album are significantly less. Obviously the creators or whomever let greed get to them, because the fun has been sucked right out. To think I’m planning to delete a game I’ve spent close to $50 on says a lot. Sad.",Used to be fun
4,2023-09-08 12:54:32,"Can I get an explanation as to why there so many duplicate stickers? I earn or buy packs and all 6 are duplicates, maybe just maybe there one newbie but to complete all 21 is next to impossible due to hardly getting new ones. The collection process is too slow.   Also, can we get a dice grab or a dice heist to get more rolls perhaps? Or at the very least earn more per board completion and new level because the amount being spend to move to the next board totals several hundred million to get like 50 dice and everyone knows you have to use that multiplier to make the roll worth while.",Stickers and dice

4,2023-08-26 15:21:11,"I love this game, it’s addicting and fun. I have several friends and family members that play it with me. I only have one complaint. It’s the sticker algorithm. I know of thirty plus people that play this game and we all literally have the exact same stickers and we’re missing the exact same ones. And I never get any new stickers, I’ve had the same stickers for two weeks. I’ve even saved up stickers and traded for the larger exchange thinking maybe that gives you new stickers but it doesn’t.

I haven’t felt a game didn’t want me to play their game because I wasn’t paying them anything until now. Your “luck” is never right when it needs to be, but is always wrong at the worst times.

One gold card in each set now isn’t that bad BUT trying to get even the lowest rated ones are a joke. I belong to several groups and the majority have not gotten a new sticker to complete sets in weeks. Unless you are prepared to spend a lot of money you are not going to progress. Even then don’t count on getting what you need. The group it sends you to on Facebook to trade is full of scammers. I have been ripped off more than once and people actually go as far as to require you to pay them money for a trade.

Dice does not add up as you are leveling up, say you’re at net worth 4,000; 10 dice gets you no where. 8 dice an hour gets you no where. Don’t get me wrong I play this game every day. I enjoy playing it. But it’s gotten to the point of this constant anxiety of trying to hard to complete things.

Also the POP-UPS in this game are absolutely terrible. There’s no option for getting them to stop, so you just have to take the torture every time you start the game and every time you run out of dice.

3,2023-08-24 12:00:07,The game itself is not difficult and can be pretty monotonous but oddly addicting. The developers need to add a “trade” option for stickers instead of only being able to gift. There are way too many scammers online yet the developers  encourage people to trade with strangers. The trade option needs to include the ability to see and approve the sticker being sent by the other person. That would make the game more fun by being able to complete sticker packs more easily. They also need to reduce the price of their items. Rolls go extremely quickly so I can’t see myself spending that much money on such a low amount of spins.,Good but needs an addition

Trading should happen within the game and not some Facebook group, where people can get someone’s personal information. By doing so, you created a market against yourself. If someone has the card I need and I have nothing to trade, why not send them $5 via Cashapp or Zelle. Time is money. The guaranteed $5 is much cheaper than what you offer.

1,2023-10-24 14:32:33,I love the game I just think the first set of stickers we completed had more dice so the rewards for playing was higher. It made you wanna play because you was looking forward to getting those dice to keep playing. Now it’s like you have to buy dice to play because waiting for an hr for 8 dice is just crazy. It’s like they gave us less dice this time so that they can really get rich off people buying dice. It’s no way you completing the same 21 sets of cards for less dice than before and it’s harder to get the sets completed because each set has gold stickers that can’t be traded. Harder to get the sets completed for less the dice is ridiculous. I stopped playing as much as I did before because I feel it’s a get rich quick scheme.,Game is great features not so much
1,2023-10-18 15:24:26,90% of all complaints I’ve seen about this game is the stickers which is indeed a scam. The chances of actual winning and completing sticker fully is a .1% without spending money. If you truly wanted to keep people playing you wouldn’t make the challenge as god awful as they’ve been and the sticker collection would actual be a lot easier to complete. I’m not saying make it so easy where everyone can complete it but it should be at the 70% chance of being able to actual obtain what you need.   unfortunately this game just isn’t it and the higher you go the more it cost.  Level 1-100 was fun now it’s just absolutely boring.  Also the dice drops and wait time is dumb shouldn’t have to wait an hour for 8 dice to drop that needs to be fixed all dice should only take 30 minutes not an hour.   Fourth complaint seeing more and more cheaters on this game each and everyday  I filed a complaint when the server went down for almost 2 days I ended up losing 5b in gold due to the cheater and they never even fixed the issue or got back to me about it. So y’all’s costumer service needs to be revamped and fixed.,Stickers is a scam
3,2023-10-03 12:34:04,"I like this game a lot but there’s just so much wrong with it. Since the new sticker collection has come out the new stickers have been so much harder to come by and the packs that you can get on the wheel are absolutely useless if you’re looking for anything over 3 stars. I can count on one hand how many new gold or 4-5 star cards I have, they just keep giving me repeats of the same cards. Dice are hard to come by because when there’s an event you have to land on certain tiles they refuse to let you land on the tiles you need in order to collect items for the dice/prizes. Again I really like this game but it’s just getting ridiculous.",I like the game but…
1,2023-09-29 00:58:29,"First thing, I really love this game. It’s the only game I keep coming back to. I’ve noticed some changes, and changes are good if they’re fair. 800 rolls, for only 400 dice in exchange is outrageous. I find myself rolling through my dice before I even get any prize, let alone 400 rolls. I have yet to receive any of the cards that are needed to complete my albums. I have so many duplicates of the one star, and two star cards, as well as 10 of the same gold cards. If it’s going to be this hard in collecting cards at least make the prizes for completing that album worth it. Some of your clientele is spending hard earned money on this game, only to receive disappointment in return. I’m sorry but that’s why I stopped, I couldn’t keep spending my money for the same items every time.",Review
3,2023-09-28 15:11:20,"Was a fun game at first but it’s impossible to get new cards. You get the same cards every time. I even saved up to open up the blue chest and STILL got duplicate cards. It at least gave me a 100 rolls. Wish you could share the gold cards and trying to understand why we can’t trade those but get duplicates??? Wish it was easier to get more dice like maybe instead of only cash grab, a dice grab? Sometimes it feels like it takes me around the board multiple times wasting rolls to get me to buy more rolls and I never land on anything. Sometimes I get stuck in jail multiple times in a row and most times I don’t roll doubles to get myself any rolls back.",3 start
3,2023-09-02 02:43:06,"I like the game but I feel that it takes to long to get more dice and it’s so little that you have to wait for… you wait an hour and they are gone in seconds. I don’t like the fact that you get a bunch of duplicate cards instead of the new cards. I wish that we could share gold cards and share dice. I also wish there was a safe place to trade cards because there are a lot of scammers out here and I also feel like you shouldn’t have to use money if you don’t want to, to get gold cards. Y’all make it so hard to get gold cards. Other than that I like playing a game I really hope changes will be made in the game.",Go game that could be great
5,2023-08-27 02:25:11,"I have to say, the sticker component of this game is a joke!!!! I love the game, but honestly it would bev100% better without it. I literally only need seven cards to finish the Wild Life pack… I open up 9 different sticker packs- NOT ONE NEW CARD!!!! It’s a joke. The trading group is a joke… unless your friends are in there- no chance of getting cards there!!!  Everyone needs the same cards to completely the pack… a joke! Exchange for stars - a joke! It pisses me off and makes me dread that part of the game!!! Can’t you add something different that would help us earn more dice???",Stickers
4,2023-08-31 09:25:08,I really love this game I stop playing all other games since I started this one but I’m starting to feel like I’m getting scammed  .you guys refuse to let me land on the rail road I even spent my money for dice and still refuse to let me land on the rail road maybe 1 time after 20 rolls ! You guys need to fix this . one of my favorite games and my game is working against me how am I supposed to play the challenge if I don’t land on the rail road out of 1500 dice rolling on x20 landed there once I don’t know if it’s just me but please fix it . Also I spent hundreds of dollars and still don’t receive the cards that I need,Game error please fix
5,2023-08-11 15:33:47,"This app must have aromas coming out of my phone because I haven’t slept in 4 days playing this game. I itch and shake when I’m out of rolls and beg all of my friends to join or send me stickers I’ve even joined the Facebook groups… FOR A PHONE GAME. Monopoly has taken over my life. My friends are late for work because we are all too worried to protect our board we can’t sleep. At this point I work for monopoly because I clock in to roll dice way too early in the morning.

1,2023-08-06 01:36:22,"Hello, I am writing this as a lot of people have been victim to the same issue of trading cards and getting nothing in return from your various social pages. I understand that it is “part of the game” however, it’s extremely demoralizing when players are allowed to navigate these groups and promise cards that are not returned. My suggestion is to have the trade be approved. You cannot accept a card if you have not traded a card in return, have the option for both trades and gifts that way if you do want to give someone a card you can. The other option to trade where it has to be uploaded and the trade be out of each players control until accepted. Just and idea overall great game, but this does create an issue. My rating is based off this issue",Trading Scammers
3,2023-08-03 19:32:01,"It’s so rare for me to get a new sticker, I get soooo many sticker packs and its extra gold stars that can’t even be traded or only worth 1-2 stars 3 if I’m lucky, I’m down to only needing 8 cards and can’t even save up for the chests, 🤦‍♀️ As far as the color wheel I feel like the gifts should get better as you level up leveled in the hundreds, 5 and 15 dice, never any new stickers and hardly any money to win, the safes are pretty much jokes as well, save up all your stars to get more gold cards you’ve already gotten. And when you’ve reached into 100s on the building houses your board complete incentives are low as well! But over all a very fun game…",Needs a few things tweaked

It honesty makes me want to quit the game especially after it glitching when I win a tournament (two days ago) and it ate my winnings (I was higher in place level).

2,2023-11-12 01:39:07,"My opinion is: the cost of each level is already extreme. After level 150 everything costs more than 800M and I find that ridiculous. Besides the dice recharging only 8 every 1hr, that doesn't make sense when you're already at such a high level. The cards reach a point where they are impossible to acquire, we have to win 189, but at least me I have 2,300 cards repeat and only 154 acquired. I think the game needs certain changes even in the offer the game show, it’s not necessarily showing the offers all the time, people can see the offers in the left side easy. Like, I have to close like 5 offers to start the game and I have to do it again When the number of dice is going down.","A nice game? yes, but"
4,2023-10-24 04:03:42,"Don’t get me wrong the game is hella fun but roll cool down is awful waiting 1hr for 8 dice is absurd and for a full set of dice it’s 10hrs for 80 dice I do this for recreation with my wife like don’t make this game a longer wait and leveling up a board you should earn more dice than 50 or more money 76 mil isn’t doing anything for boards that cost upwards of 4 billion give us a break and gold cards are like 1 in a 50 chance y’all are killing the vibe especially for all these glitches and crashes I’ve been getting just give us a better chance, but overall it’s still a good game",It’s fun but why all the waiting
4,2023-10-13 01:28:14,I play with friends and family so it’s fun stealing money from them or trying to attack them but this game is so annoying with its NRG they don’t want you to win in certain cases so they give you the absolute worse option for you to land in also no ads but the game throws its marketing genius at you every time you want to play if you have j price left OHHHH you can pay for it if u want every time I have to click x on three different pop ups to either spend money on this game or to share it will stay play but dude have an option to get that stuff out of the way,Fun with a catch
3,2023-10-13 00:08:29,I don’t know why they give you the same cards over and over. Especially when you get the best card pack and they give you more gold cards (that you can do nothing with) takes the fun out of the game. And once you run out of spins you might as well not play for at least 8 hours to even be able to get anything. Game is fun but give us more cards or let us buy them with Monopoly money or make gold cards tradable because I have 6 card sets that need one gold card to complete. I’ve had them like this for 3 weeks now. I’ve only gotten one new card this entire month lol like what dude,Same card over and over and over
3,2023-08-23 20:23:21,"When I started playing monopoly go it was fun it kept you entertained and had some small things in it too, but after so long I’ve gotten aggravated opening the game. Upon opening the game you’re hit with 3-5 ads that are for in game purchases but it seems like after anything I do even in the game while playing some ad to buy more dice or money in the game pops up. I can’t tell if this company is money hungry constantly showing us micro transactions for in game items that isn’t worth it, or they don’t want people to actually play their game with how many times the gameplay is stoped I’m better off looking in the papers for some ads","Not a bad game,"
2,2023-09-28 19:31:20,So annoying how I was so close to being in the top 3 of the daily railroad challenge and then the app decides to glitch. Won’t let me in and I’m sure that I was knock down to a lower place.   Also the amount of dice we get daily is ridiculous when you get to the higher levels and it cost so much to upgrade the buildings. The math doesn’t add up. I get 50 dice when I complete each level but then it cost so much money to finish each level.   So many things have to change. I used to love playing now I just randomly play for so many cons vs pros. Monopoly has to fix many major issues. I’ve been playing before the FB group grow to 1million maybe (5+ months) daily and the rewards are lame,Super glitch

The contests seem as though they have bots going up against you so you can not win —- I love this game but frankly I can’t afford to keep playing it —- i don’t care how many packs I open a day chances of me getting a card I need are slim to none—- and why give multiple golds if you can’t trade them —- i am completely frustrated😒😒.

Scopely and Hasbro has gotten so greedy it’s almost impossible to land on anything you need to get ahead. I think they’ve completely NERFED the landing percentage for reward tiles. We used to have so much fun, now we rarely ever play due to the new probability of actually getting rewards. The rewards used to be decent. You could actually get up a good amount of dice. Now they give you bad rolls back to back so you’re tempted to buy more dice. I rolled 2K dice with advertised Mega Bank heist and didn’t once get a mega heist. This new update has changed the game to the worst completely. The game has purposely lowered all probability. Everyone’s quitting.

1,2023-09-08 03:34:50,"This game was so cool when I first started playing which was not too long ago. I was having fun and thought they could go further w/ this game and make it sort of like social media because you get to play w/ ppl you actually know and have fun. However, the only way to play this game is to roll dice. They give you 8 dice an hour and cap you at 50-80 dice. The only way to get more is to buy dice. The prices weren’t too high (kinda like an arcade) to buy dice so it wasn’t too bad. Now they have gotten out of hand lol. I make enough to live comfortable and I usually never spend “real” money on a game but like I said it was an “arcade”. This arcade had turned into a Netflix bill lol.

There are constant glitches and issues, especially during events (for example- cookies not getting added when landing on a tile or stickers just completely disappearing). It’s so obviously rigged to not allow you to land on the “right” tile needed to compete a task/event so you have no choice but to either buy dice or feel like cr*p about yourself because you just wasted DAYS of your life in a desperate attempt to get a dang gold sticker. It was… ok… until they capped earning dice for getting friends to join to only 10 friends (1000 dice). You can’t do ANYTHING in this game with 1000 dice.

1,2023-09-07 22:58:15,Okay so this game was VERY fun for a while and I’ve met some GREAT friends . However … this game has now made it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to win UNLESS you pay . Also I was getting threatened by some girl and I told customer support and they didn’t do anything about it . My card has been charged MULTIPLE times for this game and I didn’t even make the payments cause if u know me I’m not going to sit and give money away while the richer get richer and the poorer get poorer and if anyone like me has this mindset I highly suggest u dont download this game . Also they made the album where u need a GOLD for every album in order to complete it . They say it’s to make the game “easier” but how are we going to get anywhere on 8 dice rolls an hour ? ESPECIALLY when some of our properties cost BILLIONS to even build .,Greedy
1,2023-08-29 09:25:29,The sticker sets are very hard to close. It’s almost like playing monopoly at McDonald’s or jewel they don’t give you the pieces you need. They want you basically to pay. They let you trade stickers but only allow you to trade 5 a day and you can’t trade gold stickers for some strange reason. They only allow you to generate a certain amount of dice. I made a purchase and never received my dice which caused me to drop to second place in a tournament. That was very frustrating. The game is very glitchy and reboots a lot when I go to shutdowns. They barely want to give you heist. I don’t like that they only give you 50 dice when I get to a new board but the cost to build landmarks and to get out of jail becomes astronomical once you get to higher levels.,Customer service is horrible
1,2023-08-20 11:27:04,"I have reached out to customer service multiple times to only get ignored. My game does not work. I am connected through Facebook and my board is stuck, I can’t select anything. My phone and app is up to date. I have uninstalled and reinstalled so many times it’s not even funny.  I got a response from the developer ONCE saying to go to a link that didn’t take me anywhere for help.  I have spent my real money and all I get is notifications saying other people are stealing and shutting down my landmarks but I can’t click anything on my board.

My only two gripes come from the luck in both the board and stickers. For some events I’ll roll multiple times, but will land on a space for the event once maybe twice. Not only that but whenever I use less dice that’s when I get the spaces. And when it comes to stickers, a percent of how rare a card is would be helpful, since I have cards that have 5 stars yet I can never find a specific one star.",Luck

I didn’t understand the event to well in the beginning so I paired with two randoms that barely helped me out. If the game would of let you choose a different person when you finished the game I would of been able to gotten the token which is the only thing I really wanted. Now I got left with the feeling of being that close away when if I would of just had a little more help I could’ve gotten it. I’ve invited so many friends to play with me because it’s been one of the funnest games I’ve ever played but I won’t be playing anymore because of the frustration.,Had to uninstall

The first event had glitches and my cake reset and I couldn’t finish. Got nothing for it. Okay kept playing but when you pay money and get nothing that’s pushing it way too far. You barely get any new and then when you get scammed for your card you report the people and get no response no nothing. Its now extremely hard to do anything. You get on a high level and 80 dice just doesn’t cut it. Rewards not cutting it now that it’s less. I get it it’s a business but they just make it hard to enjoy the game anymore.

I also think it’s extremely annoying when you get the two pop ups when you run out of rolls, when you still have some left it’s just not enough for the multiplier. If it popped up once when I was ACTUALLY at zero rolls, that’d be fine. I just don’t like how you have to specifically tap the x to get rid of pop ups.

But an hr for 5 rolls to me is a bit much considering other games, yes only give you 1 life every 10-20 mins. Have to wait 8-10 hrs before your dice roll bar is completely full.

There are some stickers that I believe are impossible to get (not really just extremely low odds) and scammers know this.  there needs to be a “trading” option not just a “gifting” option in game where 2 players can mutually agree on the stickers being traded.

3,2023-08-15 04:12:58,I enjoy this game a lot! BUT Am I the only one who thinks getting only 1-2 new cards in 3 weeks is a little ridiculous?? I play every single day multiple times and open up to 10 or more card packs a day. At least if we PAY for a deal with cards in it give us something new!! If you haven’t had the game for a long time there’s no way to complete the card special if I’m only getting one new one every 3 weeks no matter how many packs I open per day or buy. Yes you can trade with friends but everyone needs the same things and you can’t trade gold. Please fix this! I love everything else about the game!,Doesn’t give enough new cards!!
1,2023-08-01 21:04:51,The game is fun but has a lot of flaws. First is the stickers it is hard as heck to complete the album especially if the sticker is a 4-5 star. You can’t trade the gold ones but the game doesn’t like to give out 4-5 star stickers unless you pay a lot of money for dice and land on the rail road a bunch so you can attempt to win the challenge but you end up spending way more dice than what you will get back. The trading group it tells you to join has a lot of shady people on it so you could trade your card to someone and then they not trade anything back. The vaults you can trade your extras for isn’t guaranteed to give you new cards either. Not to mention the whole community is looking for the same cards so trying to get them is even harder on there too.,Beware

4,2023-07-10 05:33:10,"I enjoy the game, but when you added the cake update I was only 30 calculations away (out off 2,000) from 1,650 dice and a error pop up on my screen and my milestone, my tournament (which I was place at #14) and my daily challenges was all reset and I had to start all over after spending so much time and resources (&money) on it and didn’t get no type of reimbursement so I’m highly upset other than that it would help if we can trade at least 1 gold card pre-day or week, and if it just a lil easier or to be able to buy certain cards with the game money(not real money)",It’s good but…
3,2023-07-05 15:07:19,"The game is very fun and quite addictive, however I recently got on the app to attempt to open my community chest and it glitched after only 3 spins and is just now indefinitely stuck on the screen as I try to tap go it doesn’t let me interact with the button anymore. I’ve tried to go to support but I have to have an ID number only available to you through the settings which I can no longer get to as the game automatically loads up my community chest without letting me interact with anything first. Hope I can get this figured out as I love the game, without the problems my rating would be a five star.","Great game, just doesn’t work for me anymore I guess"
3,2023-06-08 22:31:42,This is a really cool and fun time waster. I do t myself needing to play it. Lol. But the only way you can really complete your sticker collection is to trade with other players. The only way to do this is via the Facebook page that has nearly a million members. There are so many posts and requests it’s near impossible. So I stopped trying. I did spend some money in this game but am refusing to spend another dime until the trade mechanic is brought off Facebook and built into the app. This can be done with a marketplace like the farm games do it. And some selfish people try and sell the cards on eBay. Love the game. Won’t spend money until this is fixed.,"Fun game, terrible trade mechanic"
2,2023-06-07 20:45:36,"Anyone else notice how sometimes you don't move as much times as you roll? Like you're a space or 2 short from what the dice rolled? That bugs me the absolute most! Also it's getting kind of boring just doing laps and shutting down or heisting. I wish it was more like the original Monopoly where you can choose to buy the things you land on and choose to put houses/hotels. Also wish it was like the original in the sense you choose different chance cards and community chest like ""get out of jail free"" cards and things like that. Another thing thats super annoying is when you open the app after not playing for a bit or everytine you run out of dice rolls, there are SO many pop ups to exit out of.",Meh
5,2023-09-29 23:16:28,This game is really fun!! I was looking for a different game to play with my friends. I also like how you included different game boards from around the world. I play this game on my iPad which makes it more hard to add or invite friends because I don’t have Facebook on here. The only thing I ask in the next update is to make it easier to add friends where we can search their name and have them added instantly so the process is easier and less difficult. Thanks!!!,Wish there was an easier way to add friends
1,2023-05-10 17:15:58,"This game is just another auto roll/press the button over and over again to move around. Its basically a knock off version of board kings but with absolutely zero imagination or originality. I don't even think this is made by Hasbro so the reviews talking about how the company has taken the game in a new direction is straight up incorrect or just a lie. Also you can only play for about 5 minutes at at time before you have to pay money to keep playing. Its also kind of creepy how they use random peoples pictures and slap an auto generated name on it and try to pass it off as real people playing the game. The ""player interactions"" are horrendously boring and also fake. This is just an obvious attempt to drain suckers for their money.",Horrible and pointless waste of time
1,2023-05-03 12:40:04,"I had an issue with receiving my daily reward, it gave me the first day again even though I was suppose to receive the 6th day reward which obviously is a higher reward and amount. You have to log in everyday to receive them in that order of course and which I did because I was hooked on the game. I messaged support about the issue a week ago and the bot informed me someone would reply within 24hrs. I sent a follow up message and still haven’t received anything back from them. It is also true that you have to put in a lot of $$$ to get top in any of the mini challenges they have. Definitely not worth the hassle considering after so long it does get boring. The maps are all the same.. nothing different 🤷🏻‍♀️",Support won’t reply back to you
1,2023-11-05 00:18:45,"Like me, you will read a lot of reviews to see if this is the game for you.   That being said, I hope this review sheds some light…. I played this game for months (as it’s addicting) but I was always hoping for a change. Each level (meaning the entire game) is an exact replica of itself. You spend hours on hours trying to get to the top of the leaderboard so you can succeed the net day/ week. LOL- if only it worked that way.   This game is FUUUULLLL of bots. You can either be a typically player or a paid player- neither matter. Once you start getting to the top of the leaderboards, the games bots always go on a “hot streak” and you will never be #1 (ever!)   Went on a steak last night and was #1 by a long shot. No question I was going to be #1 by the time to timer reset. Ohh boy was I wrong.  It was only 30 min before the end of the rewards and I was in the lead over double second place. However, when i check back 1-2 hours later, I’m in 8th place with no rewards lol.   THE BOTS WILL ALWAYS BEAT YOU!! Try something else.   I’ll send them an email with my real thoughts as this is watered down.   God speed and don’t download.",This is a joke.
1,2023-10-29 01:22:54,"Game used to be super fun and addicting, but is now just a pain. Dice regen is insanely slow and should NOT be capped at 80. Dice for completing your board needs to be a LOT higher than 50 for higher level players. Dice prize for completing albums are way too low. Partner event used to be around 60k to complete one and now it’s at 80k. Landing on wheels for partner event is now much more difficult, same as landing on railroads and when you do get a bank heist it’s now mainly large and small steals. Algorithm is all kind of messed up and the game is just not as fun anymore. I had about 15k dice saved up to complete the partner events, used all my dice and I’m no where close to finishing. I think that’s the end of the road for me for this game. No longer fun, no longer worth it. Bye Monopoly!",Getting Worse
5,2023-09-15 15:35:47,ONLY putting 5 stars so hopefully someone else will see this. This game is a SCAM. I’ll admit it’s so fun in the beginning but once you get to a high level you will wait every hour for 8 dice and you will have to have over a billion to complete one landmark then they want you to buy more rolls and stickers packs. The sticker packs you get are repetitive stickers and you’ll have 10+ of the same sticker. I get it’s just a game but it’s so frustrating when you play regularly and don’t get any thing extra while playing. 🤦🏼‍♀️,WARNING!!!
2,2023-09-29 14:52:54,I was the first excited to start playing this game not even a couple of weeks ago. But immediately I have been targeted by one person they are constantly attacking my buildings where all throughout the day I have to keep trying to play just to get more Shields. It has totally taken the fun out of the game. There is no way to remove them if they are not your friend. This person is not even coming up on the local or the global list so I cannot delete them. There needs to be away a player. Can Block or delete anyone that has ever targeted them and not just their Facebook friends. I think I’m gonna have to delete this game because I cannot enjoy it.,Fun but watch out for NON Friends!
1,2023-09-15 17:52:14,These people are so greedy with the stickers and dice. They don’t give many dice for the price they charge. When I do buy some of the packages the stickers in the paid for packs are nothing I need. I’m sorry but when I spend money on these stickers they all need to be what I need. I rarely get stickers I need much less when I spend money on this stupid game. They are making it more and more difficult to play and I’m about ready to delete my account and the app. I do not recommend this game because the higher in level you get the more expensive it is to build but yet the number of dice you earn doesn’t reflect the higher level your on. I get they want you to spend money but give me the things I need when I do. Not stupid stars. Get with it.,Greedy
5,2023-08-18 06:46:03,I loved this game until I kept getting kicked out and lost 50+ dice and over $200 million dollars. I messaged customer service 5 times telling them about the issue and how I kept getting kicked out and about how much I lost and NO RESPONSE. Nothing! Not an “I’m sorry” or anything!! I’ve spent a lot of money on this app too so you’d think they’d want to help me out! I even sent screenshots as proof. The worst customer service of any app I’ve ever used!! My advice to you- DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY BECAUSE CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL HELP YOU WHEN THEIR APP STEALS YOUR REAL MONEY OR YOUR GAME MONEY FROM YOU!!!,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!
2,2023-08-27 16:55:37,"For some reason they make it almost impossible to get these cards, there is no official trading system which leads to being scammed, and worst of all they make it almost impossible to get dice without spending money. Developers and their micro transactions these days it’s so sad to see. Apparently they “cap” you once you’ve received so many dice from Facebook friends, once this happens the game basically becomes unplayable. Can’t place high in tournaments, can’t complete events, can’t complete sticker sets unless you give them money. If they don’t fix it soon this game is going to die. Which is sad because it really was very fun in the beginning when it actually worked.",Started off great but it’s dying
1,2023-08-22 13:28:37,"They really force you to spend money on this game. You can play and play and never land on any landmarks to help you till your next goal & then once all your dice are gone, you have to buy more to keep playing Because you might be a few dice away from the prize!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m going to try to finish the album and if I do, I’m deleting this game. It’s not fun anymore . They are money hungry greedy people, oh and not to mention that All of your dice rolls aren’t properly counted, you may roll an 8 and it jumps to 9 or 7!!! You may land in jail 10 times straight but if there’s a dice event for the corner you will never touch one!!!!!!!! I’m over it! Do better development team.. make it fair for everyone.

5,2023-05-23 00:59:12,For a free game that is so fun I just love it! I love all the free gifts you get which is so rewarding you can play for a long period of time and I’m loving the daily gifts you get daily because it’s so nice just to have some money (in game) for play… I don’t want to spoil it for new time players but when I get to land on the train bored square I love playing the bank heist and shut downs to knock others buildings down! Luckily the train piece isn’t rare so you can get it a lot and have some fun with it. Over all I love this game and would definitely recommend.,This game is a good one
4,2023-08-16 12:36:27,"I love this so a lot. I play it all the time. I would so give it a 5 star if it wasn’t so hard to get some of the cards. I have open so many card packs the past few days and have not got that first new card. It’s like once you get to so many cards they stop giving you new ones, and you have to go trade. (Some people are selfish on the trading) And the amount of dice you get when going to a new board is unreal after you get so high. With only 50 dice of like broad 50 you can’t even get enough money to build the first land mark.  Other wise 10/10 would recommend.",Dice and cards
3,2023-08-04 19:43:49,"in a game where you're only granted a few minutes of bonuses at a time it's very important for users to be able to click quickly without consequences.  all my cash is immediately spent on upgrading the second building. when i tap the build button and it doesn't appear to change screens, i tap it again, because i have rent and multiplier bonuses dwindling each second. it actually turns out the build screen just comes up so slowly that my tapping the button again immediately upgrades the second building. this is annoying. i want to upgrade my buildings evenly. fix this.",clunky UI changes
3,2023-11-11 19:49:31,"Let’s be real. The game is addictive when you have a bunch of rolls. But their earning system is terrible. Micro transactions up the wazoo for little to nothing in actual in game rewards. Good luck securing any of the high star cards as they overload you with 1-3star packs. Their daily rewards are lack luster when somebody can magically throw up 5-6k in the same time you have thrown up 1k. You’d think in order to keep interacting with the game longer they would reward you to keep you in.  Pro tip, just wait till the last hour in their daily challenges. You may get lucky and get top 1-3. But again. Somebody will magically smash you in that time period.",Could be better
3,2023-11-01 17:01:22,I love this game it’s so much fun but it always says game error and won’t let me progress and keeps taking my dice and money as well. I talked to some of my friends that also have the game and they are experiencing the same thing. Maybe it was a glitch from the last update but either way I can’t even play the game right now because it keeps kicking me out and saying game error. I love the game it just needs a lot of work. I also tried to contact customer service and that was very confusing and not helpful at all I can’t even get a response from the AI chat. Making this whole experience very frustrating.,Love the game butttt…
1,2023-11-03 22:24:07,This last car event they had cheated a lot of people out of event completion due to a “bug” that just happened to hit the day the event was ending. Then on top of that they gave out “compensation” to people who actually completed the event thus giving those people double payouts but the people who were cheated out of being able to finish or who’s progress was “lost” got a measly comp gift that was no where comparable to the event completion items. Contacting Customer Service isn’t even a real person and their Customer Service doesn’t actually respond to you. Their rules say that we have to “play fair” but apparently that doesn’t apply to them. They do very shady things. This is just one example. 10/10 do not recommend!,They cheat you out of event completion
3,2023-11-01 16:34:52,"I really enjoy this game I love monopoly in general, the spooky car event is happening currently however I keep getting error “the game needs to restart” whenever I roll and I lose all progress from the roll and even lose the roll. Keep in mind this is an hour or so before the event ends and I am extremely close to finishing and getting the 5000 dice which I need. Love the game however it is very buggy and when finishing in events sometimes rewards never pop up I have been scammed out of 1500 dice before. I’d happily change review to 5 star if my past event was rewarded as well as I get my 5000 dice from the spooky car challenge.",Events messing up
2,2023-10-16 19:48:33,"Great game, first few times played was excited to find a new game! However, after you get a bit into it, you can’t play until you wait to get more dice turns and I totally get that is what they do to make money and I’m not faulting them just letting others know. It’s not fun, not getting to play and have to wait so long for turns or buy them. I’d rather buy the game and never have to stop playing vs have to buy everyday to play. They are very good at making a game that people will like and then charging to play, so in that sense good for you guys! Would love some games you could just buy if they are looking to make money but then just play.","Fun the first few times, then time to delete"
1,2023-10-29 18:49:40,"Although the Halloween theme is cute, they made the game so much harder in this last update. The current center “mini game” is 80,000 points to build one car when it was 60,000 the last center game. I’ve been actively playing daily since May and have gotten at least 10 people to play this game. They are continuously making it harder to get people to pay real money to play and it’s such a turn off making me only play to keep my shields up and get daily prizes. Really disappointed that they can’t get rid of the cheaters so they are just making the game harder for everyone else.

And I’ve got unlimited high speed internet so I know it’s not my internet. My other games that need internet loads just fine. I wish I knew what’s going on!!! I’ve played for about 3 weeks now and this is the first time having this problem. Plus why does it take hours for your dice to refill. Wish it didn’t take so long on that. Outside that I love this game.,Fun game
1,2023-10-15 23:01:43,"First of all I feel bad for any children playing this game asking their parents for the money to pay to play. This is grooming them to be gamblers. Now, look at the reviews, 5 stars for complaints and repeat one word comments with 5 stars. Shady! Now, monopoly, the real monopoly’s money had value. You could purchase things with Monopoly money. The only thing you can buy with MonopolyGO is a rigged over priced level up with a side of 50 dice. 50 Dice!? This game has become a stain on the legacy of monopoly! The dice should be purchased with Monopoly money! $99 for dice is really purchasing the game for $99 which is a bill! It’s not worth it and as a community we need to come together and stop this before other games we grew to love adopt this shady business model.",Fake ratings and real money pit!
1,2023-09-29 17:49:54,"This used to be a very enjoyable game. But now there are too many glitches. Not getting rewards that you should get (for example completing a landmark during a landmark rush). Or having someone who is not on your friends list attack you 20 times within 1 hour. You can only attack them once under “revenge”, but they can attack you an unlimited number of times, collect rent from you, and rob you in a bank heist, all while NOT on your friends list, so you can’t even block them on the game. Takes away all the fun from the game. I don’t play games to get frustrated by it.

5,2023-08-28 05:24:18,Don’t waste your time with this game ! It’s a scam! They only favor player who pay cash for advancements like $5 for 30 Dice (what is that ) .   The game itself will cheat if you roll the dice and you keep hitting the railroads or if you keep landing on the spaces with added bonuses than the game will start making your token move less spaces than what you rolled . Ex if you roll double six (12) it will move you only 9 spaces so that you don’t get the added bonus/ prize that you were suppose to !  The game will not help you complete your albums either . You will continue to get the same stickers over and over if you do not pay to play !   Don’t waste your time or energy because if the game not scamming you than the Facebook group will .   I thought the game was fun until they started doing all these updates and making it harder to have fun .,Gave it 5 stars when it’s a 1 star game
1,2023-09-14 01:16:27,Its very clear that you only care about money u make events basically impossible to finish and purposely dont allow us to land on certain spots during said events to where we use up all our dice in hopes well buy more why would I buy more dice when I cant even get proper rewards with the dice I already had its not worth it at all and dont even get me started on how ridiculous the sticker system is you want and encourage people to trade stickers yet almost everyone gets the same duplicates and always ends up needing the same few stickers and the gold cards are even harder to acquire then before please please change a few things I do like this game a lot but the higher board I get the more annoying it gets,All they care about is money
4,2023-09-10 22:33:55,I really enjoy the game when I can actually play it. Like most mobile games they feed you plenty of resources so that you can play as much as you want. But eventually you hit a wall where you have to pay to play or wait for long periods of time for your resources to build back up so you can play again. I have never been a fan of this and it eventually leads me to quit when I really don’t want to. I’m leaving a good review because the game itself is really fun and we’ll made. But it’s not a perfect score because of this pay to play model is so predatory.,Really fun but same ol story

It’s a game make it playable 7 hours to fill your rolls and 5 mins to use them and get nothing is stupid. Don’t even bother with the Facebook community thing they made.

4,2023-08-29 19:09:08,"I downloaded monopoly go! at the beginning of July 2023 and have played daily. I enjoy and love many of the features but there can be some improvement.   I've noticed once I past 4,000 they don't increase the amount of dice you receive for completing a board. But do increase the amount of money you need to upgraded a landmark.   I wish they would do more partner tournaments more frequently. I had a lot of fun partnering with my friends/family for the event.   Another bummer is that I don’t like the daily limit they currently have for trading stickers. I wish they wouldn't get rid of it or increase it by 20 if not more.   They don't allow the trading of gold sticker which holds you back from completing an album. I would allow those to be trade but count for more than one trade.

Yes, they have the Facebook group to barter but why not step it up a bit more to make the field more level. Give the option to submit a trade request. The person who you submit it to will get the request and they can counter it from 0-5 stickers in return.

Don’t fix something unless it’s broken i guess 🤷🏻‍♀️",Going down :(

It’s so annoying I put in so much work to accumulate wealth and some random person steals everything I have I have hit 12 mil three times just to wake up and it’s all gone by some random person I don’t even know. When I do bank heist it’s always someone on my friends list or someone I know so how do these random people get to steal my money all the time and it’s not like a couple hundred thousand they get to steal it’s always 3 mil or more or even sometimes bankrupt the whole 10 or 12 mil I’m over it, and there is no way to get revenge on it like you can when they try to shut down you board it’s disappointing , boring and repetitive .

3,2023-07-11 18:39:44,"Game is fun and entertaining. The new partner cake baking challenge is a great addition and brings new life to the game. Couple things that I think would make the game that much better. Would be nice to be able to go back to previous boards that have been completed to be able to see the different building that were build, sometime you go through a level so quickly that you don’t get to see and enjoy the progress/final buildings. Lastly, after running out of rolls having to exit out of multiple adds can be extremely annoying and should be advertised differently that doesn’t hinder the gameplay.",Couple Things
2,2023-07-06 19:18:13,"Downloaded the game less than a week ago and I’m already experiencing a bug that has been going on since yesterday. My app is stuck on the railroad bank heist and will not let me move past the bank heist. It’s gotten to the point that I’ve even tried flipping all of the bank heist cards and it reveals all of them but still doesn’t let me progress. Meanwhile, I’m still receiving notifications of things happening within my gameplay, i.e people attacking me, bank heists without me even being able to defend myself or participate in the game.  It’s ridiculous. I updated the software and did basic troubleshooting even submitted a complaint to the site to no avail.",Regrettable and a waste of time/money.
2,2023-11-01 17:55:19,"i’ve been playing this for a long time now i’m on board 155 and i’ve always enjoyed this game. i went on today to try to finish the car building contest since there’s only 2 hours left and now the game won’t let me do anything any time i try to play it says there’s an error and restarts the game. it’s making me very frustrated and wanting to delete the app because now that i’m so close to getting 1,000s of spins from the contest it decides to start glitching. i’ve tried updating and restarting the app and restarting my phone but the contest is almost over and i’m very upset that i have to miss out on all the prizes from it because it keeps restarting the game anytime i click a button. very convenient that it starts glitching when i’m about to finish the contest but i’ve tried everything and i’m not sure what else to do so i’m about to just delete the game all together because what’s the point if i put in hard work all week for the contest just for it to start glitching when i’m close to getting the big prizes.",game won’t stop restarting
3,2023-10-22 21:10:06,i have 2 monopoly go ids' and i complained and gave a one star.  since i did that even put in the game ripped me off during the glitches.  they never responded to that complaint.  but NOW......all my package deals are basically $59-99.  i bought over 5000 dice.  i counted.   my monopoly game piece went around the board over 26 times. not one railroad.  i noted when you roll high it goes round and round until your dice are almost gone.  then when you're almost out of dice and reduce your roll to 3x or 1 x it the goes to railroad like 3 times in a roll. then you're out of dice. and broke from spending your money on scopely.    the sad part is.  IT IS A FUN GAME!,complaint
3,2023-10-20 23:50:01,"Honestly, I’m thinking about deleting this game. It used to be fun. I don’t even spend money on it anymore. Almost everyone has the same cards, so trading is a no go. Before the last update, it was a nice balance of work and receive. Now, it’s all work. You could have a quest to land on Community Chest, and it will take over 100 rolls to do so. You can’t even reach good rewards anymore because you’ll land on the space either before or after what you would need to land on. I have only spent money on this game once since the upgrade, and I regretted it. It’s a bummer. I used to spend $5-$10 a week on this game. Not anymore.",Used to be good
5,2023-10-15 18:00:15,"While holding main elements of true Monopoly, this game is different in so many great ways that make it hard to stop playing (unless forced to…)  What I’m alluding to above is the ridiculously long refresh time for getting more dice. There are stretches of time where you can’t even play because you have no dice. Hoards of people are not willing to pass the pay wall for more dice either. You don’t get much for what you would pay.   Would love to see a quicker refresh time. Other than that, love it!",Wildly Addicting!
5,2023-06-26 03:29:45,"I love this game , i literally cant stop playing , but a fee suggestions :  1 - when we complete a board we should get more than 50 dice especially because we’re spending over 700mill to complete boards as you advanced. 2 - the mega heist for some odd reason everyday day at the same time i seem to get hit for everything in my account by a bot account not cool!! 3 : the stickers you guys give us the same stickers over and over at least give us a chance to get the ones needed! overall download the game i love it !!",Love the game

The rewards for the albums and other stuff you do used to be good, almost too good and perfect and now the rewards are terrible and not even worth it anymore. There are a lot of bots that will continue to attack you day and night in the game just so you can get on the game. They do that so you can pay money into the game and defend yourself that way. I’m not paying a single dime and honestly i used to play it every morning, afternoon and night, but now I totally forget about the game because there’s just nothing to look forward to anymore. Great job.",It Used To Be Good
4,2023-09-09 20:07:48,First the start I love the game. There are some things I would change though. Like I only get 8 dice an hour I feel like people should get there full amount of dice each hour so I would get 80 dice an hour. Also in the stickers you can only trade 5 a day I would do like 10 because one of the best parts is trading in my opinion it’s like trading Pokémon cards. Also to add I think every like hour you should get the free gift not 8 hours for 20 dice and 1 star sticker packs. And if your off for 2 hours you should get 2 gifts so you still get the rate of 1 gift an hour.,Dice stickers and more
1,2023-09-09 05:24:32,Scopely is too worried about “fixing” exploits without actually looking at why people are exploiting in the first place. The game isn’t PLAYABLE! You get barely any dice that doesn’t scale with you as you advance. You only get duplicate stickers and it’s IMPOSSIBLE to get golds. And if you do get a gold expect at least five of that one before you get any new one. The only way to get certain stickers is to win tournaments which are plagued with bots that make it impossible to win. You can’t finish the event with the dice they give you. It makes no sense to offer 2 points and expect people to get to 4K on 80 dice within a a day. The game was great at first but it has some serious issues and all scopely cares about is trying to get you to buy the twenty million pop up deals.,Greedy

I have completed every single daily task and it has been over a week since I got a new sticker. 5 packs are only 1 sticker away from being complete (most needing a non-hold sticker) I am not going to pay for sticker packs to MAYBE complete these. Along with this, I have NEVER gotten a new sticker from the sticker trade ins (100, 500, or the 1500 options).

4,2023-08-17 22:02:57,"Hello,  This game is fun and addicting! That’s not my issue. Today though I noticed a lot of things deals popping up also not the issue, because I can just hit the x to close that out.

Abd I would have only rolled once. Why are my dice being taken when I max the rolls to add more money? I am so confused it never happened on any other level. Do I need to do an update or uninstalled it and reinstall it?",I am having an issue though.

You payout more to complete a set only to receive a few bucks and 50 dice. It’s not worth it. Then they tell you to ask “the group” for stickers you may need to complete sets and, everyone needs the exact stickers you need or, you get duped and the person doesn’t send you the agreed upon trade. Also, the gold stickers… what’s the point of giving duplicates of them when you can’t even trade them?!

Only problem I have is NOT everyone has a Facebook account (which you have other social media accounts that you FAILED to add to your game), so to me this is a downfall bc I’m wanting to change my profile picture which I cannot bc you have to be connected to FB which I do NOT have.

You have no problem continuing to up the amount you take from us for different things, but the reward for finishing a board stays the same every time. The dice and cash reward should go up more every time you finish a board. And the free dice every hour should go up to 80, instead of 8. As well, you should up the amount of dice/cash you get for the free gifts and daily gifts you give out.

It’s like they want you to spend money because if you roll all of your dice that you earned, do you accumulate money, other people will steal because you don’t have enough dice or money to build new houses that’s with the only downfall of this game the longer you play they want you to spend money because you do not earn extra dice as you should","Fun, but the longer you play…"

You get WAY to many duplicate stickers, the challenges are almost impossible to complete unless you spend money, and when you are willing to spend some money the price for the amount of dice you get if astronomically out of proportion.  You need to either lower the prices or give more dice for the amount that is being paid. 2 dollars for 30 dice doesn’t even fill my roll counter.

1,2023-09-19 02:24:44,"I’ve become slightly annoyed along with many others about how this game has become stingy and just money hungry. In the beginning this game was super fun!! You were able to get stickers you needed fairly easy. Now…. It’s impossible!!! The dice roll over amount every hour should definitely be increased. You only get 7-8 dice an hour, and once your 80 amount is maxed, it quits adding up. The sticker set dice amount has decreased… I’ve also spent my own money on the game, just to get rigged out of stuff! I’ve won the 4k dice tournament, just to wake up the next the morning with only 145 of my dice left!!! Contacting customer service is a JOKE. I’m over it.

1,2023-09-18 15:29:02,This game is fun until you actually get good at it. Every update makes the game less enjoyable. Today when I logged on to get my quick wins I see that the new grand prize is a new shield icon??? It used to be a gold sticker and my only way of getting a gold sticker since the creators have made it near impossible since we can’t trade them (even though we get duplicates). The game feels pointless now and I don’t even play for my quick wins or the tournaments. The creators do not take constructive criticism from their audience at all. Go look at their instagram comments for example. Everyone has the same complaints or criticism for MONTHS yet the creators continued to make the game unenjoyable. Don’t bother downloading. It’s only fun for the first week.,Not fun anymore
1,2023-09-15 01:38:15,"When you first download the game, you can progress fairly quickly. This game is pretty much a big scam. For starters any time you get a boost under a time limit it’s like the game doesn’t want you to win the best things on the board. Secondly you collected trading cards that range from 1-5 ⭐️ but it’s hard to get the 4s and almost impossible to get the 5s unless you use hacks to get more stuff in the game or spend money. Thirdly you only get 50 dice per new board. Which starting out is fine but after 30th boards 50 dice is basically nothing. Especially with the price of upgrading the board keeps going up. I could keep listing but in conclusion this game is fine if you don’t care about the rewards but there is TONS to improve",Fun but a lot of issues

I haven’t been playing games on my phone for awhile because none of them keep me entertained or I feel like I have to spend money, and this really checks my boxes!   The only reason i’m giving 4 stars is because I don’t think the rewards for finishing boards is good. We should get more rolls the higher the level.

Yeah, I got to roll more and we get to destroy each other’s buildings but, as far as actually getting somewhere with the stickers and other contests… Nope! So if your on the fence about purchasing dice to win the big prizes, I wouldn’t if I had to do it over.

Like why ? Why did y’all do that ??? And now that i think about it i spent some money Wednesday on this game and it still doesn’t add up to $40 like y’all did this before.(i thought maybe they put it together ) Even when i got something for 7 or 8$ idk the cheapest prices y’all would take 3 extra dollars like that’s not how it work.

My biggest issues are while myself and others have lost dice and more due to their glitches during the baking event, they haven’t fixed it (and no 20 dice does not make up for hundreds and more). Also even the smal glitches where you don’t get the 10 dice credit when some profiles select yours on community chest in order to open it, does not get fixed and they do not do anything to help with the missing rewards.

3,2023-06-09 23:50:35,"So I’ve been playing the game for a couple weeks now. Was giving it a real try before leaving a review. I think the idea of the game is great. But a few things.   I agree with everyone else. The waiting an hour just to only get 5 rolls is a bit much. Kinda kills the want to keep playing and at times forget I have have the game. Like you should offer a certain amount of videos to be watched to get more rolls. And the ads. 3-4 is also, a bit much. I feel like there should be more differences between the maps and game pieces. Essentially it’s the same thing map after map. Just different theme and buildings. Like. Some maps could offer more rolls if landing on certain properties. Or certain game pieces can get you double the money earned. There’s a lot of potential for the game and I hope there’s updates to do more. Be decisive with properties and what not. Will keep the game for now. Hopefully you guys take into consideration some ideas on here.  Thanks.   Nice job so far. Keep going!",Good idea. Love the game but.

1,2023-11-02 22:28:57,The recent glitch messed me up big time. I worked my tail off to complete the spooky car Halloween event. Only to have all my dice thrown in the wind due to the technical issues this game was having. Every time I rolled my dice it was wasted and not returned because of the issues you were having. It is very disheartening to work so hard for something and feel so happy receiving my 5000 dice I earned then to turn around and have the dice basically stripped from me…. Please do better… and when there are issues on your end please consider compensating fairly. The 200 dice and ONE STAR CARD does not in any way make up for the 5000 dice I wasted along with countless high number cards I earned but then the game glitched and it was gone… I mean come on dude,Disappointed

The ratio to heist and shut downs could be tweaked just a bit so you can have more heists especially during mega heists. It would also be nice to actually get new stickers more often and not the same stickers over and over again. The one problem that I am having is that the game won’t let me in or it will take 5+ minutes to load. Other than that it is a super fun game and I recommend it.,"Fun, but a few issues"

I have spent loads of money on this game with no feedbacknorbpromise. you do not get  enough dice every net map  conpleteion or during the tiny rounds to do far as food as someone who spends money on the game. it’s sad how much money i get spent on the game and how litttle i get in return, i countldnt even get the last gold card i need last stickers and now it just feels even harder. yes i’m still going to play everyday but one day i’m going to give it up, i’m not spending anymore money on a shorty game that’s just addictive.",A daily user
1,2023-09-28 15:12:11,"This game started out fun.  The 1st time I tried to buy dice I had to cancel my debit card, it kept charging random amounts every few minutes to my card about $40 bucks worth before I cancelled 😡.  I also never got any dice at all not 🤦🏻‍♀️.   The goals are unattainable and leave you frustrated, your enticed to get free dice but that is super spammy and all about data collection and signing up for sketchy 3rd party “deals”.  Then there are a lot of problems with the game loading will shoot up an “Error” message for days which also prevents you from achieving the daily goals (hoops to jump thru) The facebook, instagram, discord groups are also very spammy and not cool and just plain creepy with messages I’ve gotten.  So very nervous about being hacked!!!",Started out Fun
1,2023-09-25 04:04:27,The longer this game is played the greedier they get. The prizes are diminished more and more. The cards are harder and harder to obtain. The micro transactions are literally pushed in your face mercilessly. Pay to win is putting it lightly. Starting out it wasn’t as bad but you can tell they also keep tweaking the algorithm behind the scenes also. Depending on which add on is running at the time you can tell your game piece will start landing differently than before the mode started to run. Nothing about this game is fair or even remotely geared towards non pay to win players. They will start losing their player base if this keeps up. They do everything possible to make this miserable for the people who do not fund their pockets with their life savings.,Greedy devs
4,2023-09-17 22:16:32,"LOVE THE GAME! My only request is to allows us to be able to trade/gift the gold stickers. I should be able to have that option with the gold sticker, especially when I’ve put MONEY (more than I care to admit here,lol) into getting them and completing the sets. I could see maybe doing that for 1-2 in the album but not for all gold stickers. I can assure you that making change would not negatively impact your user base. I’m quite sure that improvement would increase customer experience and in-app purchases. Just a thought. Thanks!!",Let us Trade the Gold Stickers
4,2023-08-25 03:52:17,I love playing Monopoly Go! The thing that really irritates me is that when I clear the board I only get 50 dice regardless of which level I’m on. A thing that’s about to have me stop playing is that I’m not going to get the cards I need. When doing the trades everything was wonderful until I got to about 10 cards left. I stopped getting cards I needed and 50+ cards that I DONT NEED! I am currently at 4 cards and I have 2 that’s gold and I CANT TRADE THEM!! That’s ridiculous!!!! It needs to change cause I’m irritated that A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE DECKS AND I STILL HAVE YET TO DINISH MINE AND WE ONLY HAVE LIKE 7 DAYS LEFT!,Love the game but GIVE US THE CARDS WE NEED
2,2023-09-12 18:59:09,The game is very relaxing to play and exciting when you win a good prize or get a sticker you have been waiting for. However with the newest sticker season they have made the game much harder to play continuously without spending money on dice. The rewards for tournaments are getting noticeably smaller and you have to use so many dice to get them. With the new sticker season you now need a gold card for each pack which take weeks to get and there are certain cards in the packs that everyone seems to need. Love the game but wish they wouldn’t have gotten so stingy with prizes forcing you to spend money on dice. Just deleted the game due to this.,Obvious that they want you to spend money
1,2023-09-11 18:25:34,"Don’t play this game, they’ve gotten more and more greedy as time goes on. This game USED TO be fun, now it’s just a tiresome bore. I don’t recommend this to anyone. Maybe if they would actually listen to the reviews/fans and would actually make the game more enjoyable. Everything feels rigged and like you have to pay to win. It’s gotten terrible.  The people rating it high have only played for a short while before they’ve gotten bored and quit. For anyone playing with a group of friends knows that you’ve all just given up after a while because the game just gets unenjoyable. There’s no fun in doing a few rolls and landing on nothing spaces then having to wait four hours before you can really play again.","Don’t Recommend, it’s a Cash Grab"
3,2023-09-11 01:47:27,"I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, but I’ve sort of lost that joy when they made some modifications to dice payouts that came with the new sticker album. They’ve seem to cut 100s of dice out of the finished sets and honestly, that’s what kept it interesting. 150 dice to finish a set is literally nothing when you have events that need a couple thousand to get through. What’s the point? I’ll admit, I used to purchase the deals, but quite frankly, I don’t feel like it’s worth it with the offerings they are giving now.   I’ll still play, but I’m stopping my purchasing, it got too outta touch.",The new album killed the experience for me.
1,2023-09-01 15:49:22,"There should be a way that trades between to people that requires both parties to put At least one card in for trade. The fact that people are continuously scamming when I’m just trying to trade cards is appalling. I don’t even want to play anymore because this has happened to me 7 times now. I’ve spent HUNDREDS on this game now and I’m really disappointed that I cannot enjoy it. Do better!  Update: now less dice once completing a sticker pack, more to open the pink vault and now every section of stickers requires a gold star. This is not how to keep customers happy; continuing to milk them for money just to play. At this rate people are better off going to the casino. At least there is a chance to win back your money!  Installed the game!",Scammers
2,2023-08-29 20:50:13,"I loved this game at first. I even got 2 co workers, my husband, my daughter and son in law playing it…. Then the album and stickers started. It’s impossible to get gold stickers, I’ve gone weeks with not 1 new card. Each level you go up the dice always stays the same amount. You need more and more money to complete tasks but dice are so hard to get. You play more dice than you get in reward. I’ve spent money and a lot of time playing and I am so over the album and stickers. It’s very unfair that some ppl have completed not 1 but 2 and others like myself are begging for gold stickers just complete 1. 2 days left and I’m done!!!   Please change dice amount per level to be fair!  Sweet Treats 🥺",Need change
1,2023-08-28 14:39:30,So when I first started playing this game it was fun but then it got so big they started to raise prices on things and started giving out terrible prizes forcing you to try and trade cards with people but there’s a lot of scammers out there that will take your stickers and not give you the ones they said they would give you. I’ve put some money into this game and I’ve gotten nothing in return. Don’t put money into it. Don’t even download it. It’s fun at first but I can’t even complete my animal tales album because the game keeps giving me repeats and I never get any new stickers unless I want to pay $20 for ONE guaranteed sticker.   I swear monopoly if I don’t finish this pack with only 3 stickers left and 2 of those being gold I’m deleting this app.,Eh
3,2023-08-16 20:38:58,"I really like this game and I would love to give it 5 stars but I have two main problems, the first is it says mega heist and yet when I land on the railroad I only get the regular one even if I have the mega heist for 15 min ( ex. I earned it from an event) and I like the fact that you can trade cards but after you send them there is no way of seeing cards that you have sent or received in the past I think a log of that would be extremely helpful. A smaller issue I have is that I can open several purple pink and blue card packs yet I only receive maybe 1 four star card from each and it’s always a duplicate.",Good but need some tweaks
1,2023-08-20 00:57:30,"Would be a lot better if there weren’t a million things popping up when you enter the game. I don’t need 4 ads to buy dice or money and then a board report. Plus, once you get to a certain level, the prices to upgrade your landmarks are outrageous and it’s not even worth playing anymore. I have bought things before and it’s very obvious that when you pay for something, you get a lot more out of it than if you don’t. I’m done spending money on this app and I’m about done playing it overall. I just get frustrated with how much stuff I have to click out of in order to just simply roll and play the game.",Can’t play until you click through 10 ads of them trying to get you to pay for something.

Ive invited many friends and even gotten to pay with my own money to play more, and the part that dissapoints me is that for a long time now I havent got one single new card from the collection. I get rewarded with cards every day and not one of them is new. I cant complete any packages because all I get are old cards. Ive send cards to friends, to people I just met, Ive posted what I need and what I can give on facebook page and nothing. After you get stuck with the same cards you dont want to play anymore. Just wish it could give more new cards.",Disappointed
3,2023-07-08 07:07:36,I loved the game and it was fun starting to get frustrated!!  However the game restarted when I was 2 calculators away for the 1500 dice prize I’m super irritated…  Then this baking challenge with the macaroons isn’t achievable you don’t get enough of them or the meter doesn’t move… roll all your dice jus to get a few macaroons that means you guy are tryna force ppl to pay for dice… the objectives aren’t easily achieved either… and the stickers are a ripoff I feel like I’ll never finish the last few set I kept getting hundreds of the same stickers… this game is made for ppl to spend there money in any way they can… it’s a ripoff of time and money,Fun but frustrating
3,2023-06-26 01:31:23,"I really enjoy this game and I think it’s fun. There’s just a couple things that could be changed and made more accessible for the game to be more enjoyable.   1. The pop-ups when you open the game trying to get you to buy dice rolls, stickers, etc- Multiple back to back? I feel like they can just simply be posted on the side or just updated in the store section of the menu. It’s really annoying.  2. Having to wait an hour for like 5 dice rolls is ridiculous. And only getting 70 a day. I feel like as we progress through the game, the dice rolls should increase or we should be able to acquire some when passing GO.  3. Having a sticker collection is nice, but it’s really frustrating to get these “nicer” sticker packs that have 1 or no new stickers for your collection. I am constantly getting duplicate cards any time I get a sticker pack.  4. Lastly, the event time frames that last 2-3 days make it impossible to really get any decent perks because of the limited dice rolls.","Love The Game, But Some Annoyances…"
2,2023-11-02 13:58:36,I play this game Al the time it use to be very fun but now it’s getting pretty boring I’m on level 193 and still only getting 50 dice for completing a whole village.  And I have not gotten a new card in weeks. I trade all my cards in the 500 and 100 and still get the same cards why do they need to give us sooooo many cards that we obviously do not need  the vaults should have at least 1 new card smh.  And the community chest is a joke.   I love this game but it’s still same as board 1 when I started would be nice to actually win more dice them money because we get that with our friends rent   Would be nice to get more then 50 dice for finishing boards that we spent billions on lol,Use to be fun
1,2023-10-16 19:12:06,I have spent over $300 in 3 months on this game. I got double charged for a purchase that the game specifically limits you to 2 purchases. Hours after the double charge I checked the game and the purchase they claimed I made still said 1/2 available meaning it was impossible for me yo have made the purchase. I requested a refund and was denied even after offering the screenshot that proved I was double charged. Won’t surprise me at all if this company is later I involved in a class action suit. Do not download this game. Do not spend money on it. The rating is clearly faked. There are multiple reports just like mine saying they double charged then kept the money but they pay apple to bury the negative reviews.,Double charges purchases then denies refunds.

It didn’t bother me until I had built up about 500 in dice and each time it kept landing just before and just after. So I deleted it.

I’m slowly on my way to deleting the game completely, but I’ve been holding on and just just logging in every once in a while to see if Hasbro improves their stance on the game.

I also think they should put a prize to win 30 mins or so of unlimited dice. There’s got to be something to keep people playing otherwise those of us that want to play will eventually get tired of it and delete the game entirely.

So they make it nearly impossible to complete sets unless you buy their “guarantee card deals” which are never cheap. Some of are trying to enjoy the game without buying something especially if your from a low income family… they make it real known they are a money hungry game.

I have 7 duplicates of one card while getting several notifications that I have limited time left to collect the rest. It's not that serious, just annoying.

The amount of “free” spins they give you is based on time, and you can’t collect more than 80 at a time, over hours and hours, which lets you roll just a few times around your board.

Like come on we’ve literally spent all of our hard earned money building and we can barely afford that because the amount of rolls we get not all of us are spending our hard earned money buying dice because we can’t afford it but still manage to contribute when we can but I feel like once you level up boards we deserve more dice instead of the money,Okay so here’s the thing
3,2023-08-24 18:24:12,"The game itself is very addicting but there are many things that come to mind when playing to make it better. As in the gold cards… make them TRADABLE!! It’s so hard when you have extras and friends need them also and you have 3 of the same card that can’t even be traded what since does that make. Trading in general there should be a few different settings along with that.

It’s even better that the button to close them tends to be in a different spot on some of them. Extremely frustrating that they are running 5+ “deals” at the same time.

4,2023-05-09 13:35:07,It's fun to play. Unpaid plays can go very fast and take an hour for a 5(or more depending on level). My main issue is when I have 5 plays in 2 minutes get a roll and get full dice and then have to wait another 1h for the 5 rolls you should've got for the last hour you waited. Also would be cool if recharge rolls could be used first so the refill could start when they 50 free rolls are done instead of after you spend the milestone dice making saving them strategically pointless as you will not recharge any you use until you get below 50,Fun but needs some work
2,2023-06-16 19:26:20,"I enjoyed the game for the first couple of days but once you get past the first few boards, you stop getting awards, like more dice rolls, as frequently. When that happens, you’re left having to wait an HOUR for 5 rolls which takes about 15 seconds to use. The board challenges are designed such that you must pay to buy more dice rolls to achieve.   I think the concept of the game is good for a mindless time-filler game. A bit repetitive and I wish the railroad games were more interactive/actually challenging/and had more options. But waiting an hour for a 15 second payoff is by far the worst part of the current layout in my opinion.",Must Pay to Play Almost at All After a Day

I’m a fully capable adult that knows where the store is located in the game, if I had the intention to buy more dice, I would.

But the fact of the matter is this game feels like it’s designed to make you spend money to get anything top tier winnings. You have thousands of people the monopoly groups bragging out having faults full of cards and won’t help anyone succeed to get their sets done. When you purchase packs for super packs you get the same 1-2 star card kicks that are useless. The rolls take forever to generate. Everything is so expensive in this game and people are soooo greedy.

3,2023-10-17 04:29:00,Started playing this game thinking I got the original monopoly. It was a very fun game at first but you come to the realization that it becomes pay to win as you get higher in the rankings. You run out of dice faster than money making it difficult to earn tokens to place in any of the tournaments they have. And they deals they have for dice when buying can easily runout without actually making advances on tournaments and leveling up. It eventually becomes a game you roll the free dice you have and come back later in the day when they get back up. Other than that it’s a good game.,"Great game, but becomes pay to win"

The only thing is after you get so many stickers your at a stand still because when you get the sticker pack, it all the same ones. It’s hard to get new ones. You can exchange stickers with friends and family but if they are needing the same ones, it’s hard to do. The extra rolls every 8 hours is nice and you also get rolls every hour.",Love this game
4,2023-10-06 23:17:33,"To get started I’d like to say that I have really enjoyed this game over the past few weeks but besides me having fun  I have a few ideas I’d like to share first of all instead of having to pay real money what if you could buy rolls with, in game money or real money. Here’s an example I could buy 50 rolls for 5 dollars or 5 rolls for 200,000 in game dollars also what is you could buy a 1 star sticker pack for one million in game dollars and finally as much as I would enjoy my ideas implemented in the game I still would enjoy it even if you didn’t. 👍🏼",Cool idea!
1,2023-09-28 00:13:28,"I have tried my best to reach out privately to someone about the issues I have had with this game yet no one wants to respond!! Normally I wouldn’t give two craps and just delete and move on!!! Yet, the fact I have literally talked over 100 people into downloading this game and giving it a try, on top of investing a ton of money on this game makes me so upset I even worked so hard to promote and support this nonsense!!  Y’all are selfish and don’t care about your followers!! You take, take, take but yet to care about us!!! I’m so done with allowing someone to take my money but won’t give me one second of their time to make a resolution!! Way to go guys you really failed with this one!!!",Used to love this game now I could care less what happens!!!
4,2023-09-26 23:21:49,"It’s an awesome game and all but does anybody else feel like when you roll the dice it take a few away when it should only take 1 roll at a time. I mean you only roll once not 5 times in one roll, I feel that’s why we run out of dice too quick it takes more than it should. Also, it should not be taking THAT long for 5 dice like I’d understand if it was for maybe 15-20dice for an hour but just for 5… not cool. But other than that it’s very fun and entertaining especially when you play with family.",Awesome game… but takes too long on dice reloads
1,2023-09-20 17:00:16,"When the game first started, the odds of rolling on tiles you needed were fair and the sticker packs gave stickers at a fair randomization. Now, the game very obviously changes the odds of landing on tiles based on the events. It does a great job of getting you as close to a milestone as possible and then not letting you get what you need so that you’re enticed to spend money on more dice. Every sticker album now has a gold sticker that can’t be traded in it, and it gives you the same gold sticker every time you’re lucky enough to get a gold pack. Again, it is all done in an attempt to get you to spend money. The game has gone from a fun, unique game to a money grabbing piece of garbage. Scopely will not be getting my patronage any further.",Play for free but pay to win
2,2023-09-19 17:33:47,"This game has gotten beyond irritating over these last few weeks. Duplicate stickers over and over again, hardly any chance to get one you don’t actually have. Not enough chances to get dice have been given. All in all, I’m seriously close to deleting this all, as I’ve seen a lot of people mention they are considering doing in the Monopoly Go Facebook Group. You would think since it’s your Verified Facebook that you would be seeing the negative feedback you are receiving and make a change. This new set has been a complete headache for so many players. All of us are having the same issues. Do better or lose players!",Do better or lose players!
4,2023-09-12 01:31:48,This game is highly addictive and a lot of fun. Especially when playing with Loya of friends and family.  I have it 4 stars because of the following: 1) takes to long to regenerate dice  2) can’t trade gold cards and they are hard to get  3) stickers dice rewards have dropped dramatically  4) dice are getting more scarce as I reach board 200 5) the last partner game to build a cake was impossible to compete without spending real money.  These type of things make the game not so fun. Even if an option to spend money is there please make it so the challenges can be beat without spending. I feel that my board was rigged to not land on things to help me accomplish task and collect cookies. There is no way I rolled 1200x10 dice and only landed on 4 railroads.  Enough dice weren’t rewarded to complete the challenges. 150 dice as the first reward. That blows.   Please make positive changes!! We want to keep playing the game!!!,Great game until you Rea ha certain level
4,2023-09-10 05:44:10,This game is really addicting I love that u can add ppl like your family or friends I love the board game so much heres maybe a little adjustment I would like! I would like if u could team with some one I don’t have any problems with the updates there amazing I like that they give u 5 roles every hour but i think it would be better if it’s 10? I like how you can get cash and tap it at certain times! I love the characters I really wish you could use a photo not from Facebook tho! That’s all I have to say I love this game so much !,Monopoly is one of the best games in my opinion
1,2023-09-08 04:25:38,"This game was so fun, exhilarating, and addicting when I first downloaded it. I even made several posts about how fun the game was, and telling my FB friends to download it and play with me. 😂 but now, it’s soooooo rigged. And no matter how much money you spend, you hardly ever get the stickers needed, when you’re close to finishing a challenge, they make it almost impossible for you to land on certain marks. 8rolls/hr is the max they offer, and trust me when I say - ITS HARDLY EVER ENOUGH. And ever since they updated it, it lags so much sometimes rewards don’t get accounted for or come in late. It was really, really a great game. 😩 I’m trying to stick through, but, they really have become greedy. And don’t try contacting support - their AI chat support is NO HELP.",Had great potential..
4,2023-08-27 15:46:55,Love this game I just wish that there was a way for me to chat with my friends in the game. It would be so much better for events that are coop. Also hate that you can’t just trade with people and you have to add them as friend because now I have random people attacking me and have no idea who they are not to mention I didn’t get any reward for adding them so it’s pointless to even trade with people in the trade group also most of the people in the designated trade group spam or scam you. It’s ridiculous to say the least. But it is just a game nonetheless,Need chat feature.
5,2023-05-21 13:23:56,"Nothing ago was a great way to pass the time. It’s a mix of the old days of playing the board game with the new technology of an app. It’s nice to have some free roles along with things you have to earn however, it would be nice as you advance to earn more free rolls an hour as well you get to board 20 and you’re still only earning six rolls per hour seems a little stingy. It would make the game a little more fun if you earned a little more free rolls an hour, as you continued to reach higher boards.",Great way to pass the time
3,2023-08-01 13:18:47,I actually thoroughly enjoy this game.. however it really needs the bugs fixed before i stop playing it. I have my family on fb attacking me over and over bc im on there friends list. However they are not on mine so i cant mess with them back and its super frustrating. I had a long time friend and i back an forth attacking each other. We got to 160 attacks and then somehow he was just erased from my friends and neither of us can figure it out. So now we cant even attack each other and enjoy the game like we were…. And this isnt just me its happening too…. Im on the 40th map. And ready to just delete it…,Super annoyed
1,2023-07-24 14:35:26,"After you get to a certain point in the game every time you come back to it all of your money is gone. I’ll have been playing and have upwards of $65 million and when I come back I only have $80 thousand. Now all of a sudden people are winning $38 million from me on bank heists and depleting my money. First of all, I’ve never won anything close to that on a bank heist. Secondly I never used to come back to the game to find that they have taken that from the money I had. It just makes the game not worth playing. Every time you come back you have to start all over.   I spent so much time trying to work with their customer service only to find out that they can’t help me!   What’s the point??",The game is not worth playing anymore
1,2023-07-11 12:28:35,"The game started out fun and easy to play and becomes addicting if you’re competitive , however the further you advance in the game the more issues you’ll have playing it. Trading cards with others to complete your album is hard when all the players need the same card also when other players scam you for your cards. There isn’t a in app trading to make sure you’ll actually get the card you tried to trade, you just have to trust a random facebook person to actually be a person of their word to hold up their end of the trade. The reload to get more dice is an hour just for only a couple and not a full reload because they want you to spend your money in order to keep playing.",Addicting yet useless
1,2023-07-05 16:02:54,I love this game my husband and I became very competitive on who could collect the most stickers and who can accumulate the most dice rolls and roll longer. Lol but lately my game keeps crashing when I’ve won something and now it wont load past 30% even after updating and restarting the game my phone etc. Please fix this. We love playing this game together and with our friends but wont be worth it if it keeps crashing.  And I did also want to add that the 4 and 5 star stickers although I understand they need to be somewhat harder to find but I mean come on. Everyone I know (and I’m in 3 Monopoly Go! groups on FB) is looking for the exact same cards. Make them more accessible and tradable (Gold Cards too).,Will update rating if bugs get fixed.
2,2023-11-07 21:29:52,Ok MonopolyGO I have been quite for a while you have been updating the app but nothing to the game the same stickers the same amount of dice like the game should not like coin masters I know your the same creator but let’s do things differently we spend our money just to get the same cards so waste of money I could of bought a half price drink at Sonic with!! Let’s do better! The game needs a group chat as well so we can ask our friends on there and not search for them on fb let’s do better the app is free but with the purchases people make everyday from the game should be enought to help us! So mr go man can I pass go and collect my 200 dice!!!!,Update the cards

It’s so the game is rigged so you have to spend money the game is rigged to make sure one has to spend money. And all the scams that go along with trying to sucker you into something else is just crazy. Like take your pick get the game to make you buy stuff to give you the illusion that you are in control or the people trying to scam you to think you are gonna get ahead on the game . Basically everyone just wants to steal your money irl,it is unreal.",Fun but expensive
2,2023-11-03 00:19:38,"This game is rigged I enjoyed it for a while glad I didn’t review it before it started being all messed up. I’ve had dice I paid $ for disappear, Ive done all these crazy events to get stickers and always get repeats never any new ones. Spin their wheel, wheel will completely stop, then miraculously move on its own again (never in my favor ofcourse)… it’s becoming a real money and time sucker and for that it gets 2 stars. I’d give more if it was possible to actually play properly. Monopoly play fair or shut down your app! Just as crooked as the people in the Facebook group who just steal all my stickers and then block me instead of trading! Stop pushing that scammy FB group!!!",It’s rigged
4,2023-10-07 15:05:19,This game is tons of fun and I enjoy playing it. Having said that I’m disappointed that there is no in app messaging or ability to share materials with friends and teammates. Nothing is more frustrating than to select super active players to be your partners for events and then they don’t perform during the events. This happens quite often. If we could message them within the app to ask them to help or if we could share or donate materials with or to each other it would be awesome!,In app messaging and material sharing would be awesome!
5,2023-06-27 04:35:56,"Dear Mr Monopoly, perfect way to end scammers!! Instead of ONLY having a “send to a friend” button there should also be a “Trade With a Friend” button that allows you out put your card in a vault with the name of the card you’re expecting, and if the card you’re expecting isn’t put in the vault by the 2nd party then your card will be returned to you in 5 minutes!! Some people spend money on your bundle packs and it isn’t fair for some people to receive your card and not send one back.",End scammers during trades
2,2023-09-27 18:21:08,"Where do I start? ... they have made it IMPOSSIBLE to ""win"" or get any of the goods without spending money. 8 free dice an hour..? A JOKE. Your free gift every 8 hours is somewhere between 15-30 dice. LOL thanks scopely.. obviously an even bigger joke. You play daily tournaments with bots that have scores anywhere between 45-90k points within minutes of the tournament starting. Don't even get me started on the duplicate cards. The gold cards -which they've made these ""investments""  unable to trade with friends. Again meaning... you don't pay real money, you won't get. And when you do get a gold pack it's always a duplicate. Come on scopely...I know you have to make money. But do better!",Mediocre at best
2,2023-09-19 18:40:30,"I’m on board 132 so I’ve played a good bit. They definitely make it hard to get new stickers or anything if you just play the game as is. I see tons of people thriving and enjoying the game, but they all pay for the extras to be able to enjoy it more. This is definitely a pay to play type game if you want to enjoy it. I refuse to pay $5 for just 80 dice that will be gone in less than 2 minutes and do absolutely nothing for me. The sticker album we’re on now (epic myths) is extremely difficult if you don’t pay for extras. The only give you green and orange sticker packs (the lowest) and that has nothings but duplicates after the first few. This game was so much fun at first.",Meh.
3,2023-09-17 03:49:06,"The game is fun. However 1) we don’t get double moves when we roll doubles. Not in line with Monopoly rules. 2) I make purchases in every free game I play. It’s only fair to support a game I really enjoy. The problem with this game is that they charge a lot for very little. 100 rolls per $1 sounds about right to me. They don’t even come close. It’s so little, I can’t stomach spending any money in game. 3) The mechanics of adding friends in game is pretty awful. I can’t figure out how to unfriend or add new friends behind the initial few I added my first day of play. I’m not sending advertising invitations to rl friends. Please improve this feature!",Fun But…
4,2023-09-10 03:31:59,"I’m am 100% in love with this game. It is so addictive and I have gotten so many friends into playing as well. I love moving up boards and earning cards and trading with friends and people in the face book trading group. I would say the only issue I have is lately on the little tournaments that give you the presents to open, I haven’t been getting all of my gifts, it skips over some and I don’t get the prize for it. Not sure if it’s a glitch or a lag in the game but it’s definitely a bummer. But other then that, 10/10 would recommend!! Such a fun game!! Love it!",Game review
1,2023-09-08 20:03:11,"Okay kids strap yourself in for a story! The story of not getting your cookies when you land on them for the cake event, your dice being taken away by game glitches, and being forced to pay money for duplicate stickers that don’t help you advance your albums! Oh! And the best part of the story is, when you make it to higher levels where it costs a billion dollars to level up anything and to get out of jail, but you only get 50 dice for completing said board and 8 dice an hour. Oh, oh! Don’t get me started on customer service and the “5 days” it takes to hear back from them and it’s still silent on their end!   Seriously this game could be so much greater if all of these things were fixed.","Really fun game, but too much is wrong with it!"
4,2023-08-30 10:23:54,They gave is fun and addictive! The more friend’s you have the better! The game does have issues. For one I think it would be better if you have to confirm sending the sticker because if you tap the wrong name its gone. To avoid scamming people of their stickers I think they should have the add the card to a box and trade at the same time. also unless your willing to drop  money into the game it becomes unplayable and just annoying we need more dice. 8/hr isn’t enough.. although I feel like throwing my phone over this game I still enjoy playing..,Good game
1,2023-08-29 22:21:28,"Second time writing a review because this is getting ridiculous my recent review said that I bought TWO different sticker packs offers and I never received the other offer I purchased on aug 21st. This morning I woke up to only receiving one of the purchases I made and not the other one it came with a blue sticker pack 1,400 rolls and some amount of money I can’t remember but I’m just getting irritated cause y’all not giving me all the rewards together I sent in proof of both of the charges and y’all chose to only give me one of the rewards I’m about to delete my whole account cause y’all taking  my money and not giving me all the rewards that I purchased y’all better fix it!!",Received one of the offers but not the other
2,2023-08-27 19:01:32,"The game was cool when I first started playing but as time went on I started to stop liking the game, First of all an hour is too long to wait for 8 dice and i’m not the first person to say this and I won’t be the last, Within that time most games would be refilled completely if not almost done.   I get 8 dice per hour for a total of 80 face which means it takes around 10ish hours for me to refill if I don’t have left over dice I don’t use.   We need more challenges like the baking and the cars and we should also be able to change our partners if they aren’t helping us with the challenges, it takes a lot of points just to finish one car with somebody that is helping so imagine doing that with somebody that isn’t helping you.  This is really a pay to play game, once you run out of dice and your being attacked repeatedly by people who won’t put up landmarks you tend to buy dice so you don’t have to wait a whole hour for 8 dice   The idea was there when this was made but overtime the game just got wack real fast",Review
4,2023-07-10 15:45:01,"I would be leaving a 5 star review HOWEVER, I feel like trading should have its own page (kind of like the OG Monopoly game) where you trade sticker for sticker or can gift if that’s what you choose BUT you won’t get scammed for cards. I love everything else about the game. It’s super easy and fun to play and the events make it even more fun and addicting. The stickers are a fun way to collect extra rewards which is super convenient! I also love the latest changes with the 8-hour gift boxes instead of 22-hour! I will for sure keep the game and keep recommending people join!",I love this game!

You could even friend people. I only friend my cousin, This game is just so fun I’ve been playing it for hours. I’ve literally download this game five days ago and I cannot stop playing. It’s basically like a monopoly, but a few changes you can get mega heist and steal people money. it is so fun. When I saw the ad I download it immediately. this game is so fun.",So much fun.

4,2023-11-11 13:25:45,"The game is fun and challenging but after a while you get stuck trying to collect stickers. you just keep getting the same ones over and over and over and they make it impossible to get the four/five star stickers or the ones you really need. You would have to rely on trading cards, but some people want some of the wildest things for a five star card. And the challenges like the car show or the cake baking is outrageous you and your partner have to get like 80,000 a piece in order to complete your goals",Fun with impossible task
4,2023-11-02 13:43:25,The ratio of rolls to get wheels for cars is unfair and rarely can anyone who spends or banks hours on this app complete the car competitions . I know any game is meant to be hard or frustrating but not in a way where you felt time wasted. Rarely in packs do you get new stickers it’s almost like it’s guaranteed failure so you keep trying but this will make any app die in my opinion . At least at random allow SOME people to win but everyone I know plays this and said the same . Not to mention most are saying it’s MORE now to spend on cars & stickers.,Stickers and Cars
1,2023-11-02 21:25:30,"Can’t finish the contest in time due to their delayed payment of rewards! They have changed their reliable ways to no ways! Would not recommend at this time. They normally pay daily rewards within the hour of finish but not this time. They say they have 24 hours to pay. But no time before did it take this long. I could have finished the car competition had they paid out in the normal way they do. Also, people not in my friends list are able to heist my bank. This has happened 3 times in about a week. That’s another serious issue that I contacted customer service on and have never received a response. Apparently they do not care.",Rewards not being paid as normal.

That’s all this game is worth until changes are made!!  First off, sticker packs. I’m sorry, but almost every group and forum i’m in for this game is so irritated with this, some have even just straight up quit the game altogether. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous how hard it is to get any 4 or 5 star cards. I haven’t been able to complete a set in weeks!! We are continuously given the same 3 star and lower cards. It’s absolutely asinine.   Secondly, 7-8 rolls an hour is ridiculous. It’s not incentivizing at all! Like come on, please be serious here!   You guys seriously need to listen to you customers, and make changes happen. You guys did it with sending gold stickers, and doing one gold per set. Make the adjustments.

The price of building is high compared to what anyone can get with amount of rolls are given freely throughout the day. It took me 4 days to finally get lucky enough to pass level 5 and that was because I was lucky but now I’m repeating the same thing on level 6. I could understand this at higher levels, but to be this difficult to progress without money transactions and to be not even above level 20 is unreasonable.

I’m also trying to figure out how some random person was able to get money in the bank heist whom I am not playing with?? How does this happen? I am not playing the game or have any knowledge of this person. I cannot play back with them but yet they can take my money??  Seems very odd to me!

I love everything in it! From the short animated dices falling away from the screen to the little Monopoly dollars rushing toward your stash from the middle of the screen! It’s just so satisfying and awesome as a game itself. You get to make social friends on the game and I love the original side events! This 5-star game is perfect to get you started on REAL monopoly. I enjoy it and recommend you try it out!,I like it

Let’s no even get started on special events and how the game is rigged against you. Also can we stop getting duplicate gold cards since we can’t do anything with them and it’s hard enough to get them to begin with. I get it, it’s a game and you’re in it to make money.

You think they’re going to still award me? Smh. Then when you send them a message in app, they ignore you or send you a small fraction of what you lost in their game!

Payouts keep getting smaller and the 50 dice  for finishing a level never increases!  They give prizes for challenges that most people cannot use like the chip increase for multiplier on dice rolls.  That’s a prize ?  Used to have more hourly challenges and the challenge to clear a level you get 30 dice?? Or 10 for finishing a landmark?  As you go upon levels they don’t increase rewards to where it’s impossible to play!  Loved it in the beginning , but it’s getting worse as the designers get more greedy.",Going downhill
4,2023-09-07 16:36:49,I like the game and stuff but it’s very much pay to win kind of game if you don’t have enough friends to help you out with stuff like card collecting or getting more dice. The trading is okay but would be better if you could trade more than 5 times a day. That’s not very much. I think it should at least be 10 times or unlimited. It makes it harder to get cards you need when you can’t trade cards to others due to limit being hit already. I like the cake and car events and wish they happened more often then they do now.,Trading

I love how you can actually steal from other people, and they can steal from you! One thing that does make me a little sad, is that you need Facebook in order to get friends…but playing as a guest is fun too! And guess what…You don’t need internet! (For me though idk about other people) I recommend downloading this game! And it is free as well! (Another great thing!) thanks for reading this big ol’ paragraph that I typed!",This game is ADDICTING!
1,2023-08-05 18:21:39,I really enjoy the game but having to wait hrs to get rolls and not getting any new cards is frustrating. It’s crazy because you get to a certain point and it seems like everyone is looking for the same cards. I’ve spent money hoping that would lead to some new cards but it doesn’t. At one point I got rid of all my cards and got back to over 600 only getting 1 new card during that who process. I’m not going to keep spending money cause tbh the deals aren’t all that great anyway. It’s also not easy to reach out to customer service. Finally made it to the page filled out everything and the continue button on the page wouldn’t work. Game has great potential. Fix the card algorithm!!!,Could be better
4,2023-05-16 01:51:11,"I love playing this game. I’m impatient, so I will pay to get more dice, money and stickers. I’ve only been playing about a month and something happened. When it’s time for shut down, the animation gets into the train and the game freezes. It lasts 15 mins. I close the game, close the app and sometimes it works and goes to the next stage of pic a person that you want to destroy their property or rob a bank.   Sometimes it doesn’t work and I turn off my phone. Please fix this.   I don’t want to get so frustrated that I just remove the game from my phone.",It’s so fun until….
4,2023-10-30 03:23:38,First off I really enjoy this game and love it has challenges and also love i can play and trade with friends. Now thay was the good and now for the not so good. Why is sonjard to get certain gold cards. You can spend money and still get duplicates of the same gold cards and its the lower ones. Other folks take advantage of this and then they scam others its not fun at all . And as for the partner games where you build the wheel seems to only want to give out low numbers and 80k to finish is a little much. Where is the fun if its so stressful.,Love/hate relationship
1,2023-04-27 02:59:20,I want to know where my dice went. This is the second time. I have stopped playing because I had something to do to come back and my five be gone that I had when I stopped playing. The first time. I let it go because I thought maybe I was just mistaken. But this time. That is not the case. I had 280 dice when I stopped playing this afternoon. I know for a fact. Then I come back and I only had 29!!!! And I spend plenty of money playing this game. This is bull crap. I want my dice back. I’m not spending another penny on this game. It’s not enough we pay. But you take away our dice so we will spend more. Scammers everywhere you look these days. Can’t even play a dang game without being taken advantage of. It’s a crying shame!!!!,Missing dice
1,2023-11-01 20:07:37,Played this game for months now and love it but after today I’m done I almost had the last car completed and had 5hrs to do it but the game kept kicking me and resetting it back like 12 moves so I couldn’t complete the game then when they finally fixed the issue they never let anyone know so the 500m that I kept getting back cause it reset got robbed from me so I wasn’t able to do the same moves I did 12 times in a row when it kept resetting so not only did I not get to complete the last car I lost the money to be able to get where I needed to be able to complete it so now I’m done with this game this isn’t the first time it has done something like this to me very disappointed,Waste of time
4,2023-10-25 19:09:16,"i just waited forever to win that most recent event, i even put at least $40 into the game to keep the top spot so i could win the 1,500 dice. won the dice and hit nothing but taxes and jail EVERYTIME around the board. I worked hard and spent money just to lose all those dice in 5 minutes. i don’t like that when we have large amounts of dice we “miraculously” never hit railroads or properties that give us credits towards the event. Stop forcing people to spend money by taking away dice they earned from events it makes the game no fun to play",This is a real pain….
3,2023-10-29 21:41:25,"This game is really money hungry. They upped the event from 60k - 80k to complete, making it almost impossible to finish unless you buy dice because the gifts they do give in the regular everyday events are horrible. 1 - 2 star cards should not even be a gift for people who are over a certain level. I loved this game at first but now it has gotten annoying.   I also should not have to exit out 5 pop up screens trying to force me to spend money on the game. At this point we all know where to go if we want to buy something but forcing it down my throat is just turning me off the game.",Money Hungry
4,2023-10-09 19:37:23,The game is okay but the concept with the stickers is pretty dumb to me. You have to get the best sticker packs in order for you to complete your set and in order to get the best sticker packs you have to pay. I understand they want to make it hard for you to compelete the set but I play the game every single day and i constantly get duplicates it defeats the purpose of the stickers. And there should be more ways to receive dice. Unless there’s a tournament or partner up going on you really can’t get dice unless you play. I hope the developers fix this !,Okay game but…
5,2023-09-01 00:55:17,MONOPOLY GO how do you remove a person that isn’t in your friend list that consistently attacks your landmarks or does a bank heist on you but you can’t take revenge on them because they’re no where to be found which is ridiculous. The game isn’t equal competition. It’s not being a sore loser it’s about being about to take revenge on them like the button is supposed to be used for. Either I get the same opportunity or I remove them.,Removing people that you can’t see on your friend list
1,2023-09-23 13:32:43,They make it almost impossible to complete the decks. I have numerous card decks with +14 extras of the same card. This game is supposed to be fun and now it’s not. Complete a board and only get 50 rolls. If they seriously think that people are gonna spend money on this they are beyond wrong. If we can’t trade good cards then why give us multiple. Complete waste of time! And the PEG game. Gotta have tokens for that which they are being stingy with. Also the team events… we should be able to edit the friends we play with if they aren’t putting in the work. Putting in all the work for them not to participate and use all of our dice to finish it because someone isn’t doing their part!,Multiple cards and not enough dice
5,2023-08-25 12:38:43,"Absolutely LOVE this game. Only suggestion I would make for a possible change, is to maybe have the option to exchange the gold cards that we may have duplicates of for the ones that are needed.  Maybe set the game to where if you have a duplicate gold, it will automatically exchange it for one you don’t have, even if it’s an exchange for a gold with the same star count.  Or allow them to be traded?   Other than that, the game is beyond addicting!",Option to exchange duplicate gold cards
1,2023-08-29 02:38:58,"Do not play this game. I’ve been playing for three months and the aim of the game is to get cards to complete an album. They stop giving you those cards (through natural play) toward the end and the only duplicates they give you are gold cards which you can’t trade. They practically force you to spend money to complete the album. There’s a Facebook trading group with is beyond ridiculous and no one wants to trade the cards. By the end, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get gold cards unless you spend money. And what is all this for? Freaking rolls. Bragging rights? Ya, whatever. Trust me. This game reels you in and all you achieve to do is get rolls and complete an album which gives you more rolls. FOR WHAT!! Don’t spend your money on this game!!!",Worst for taking your money
5,2023-08-06 04:51:16,This is one of my top 5 favorite things to do when I’m bored or needing a little challenge and excitement in my life I spend hours bored wondering what to do but ever since my friend introduced me to monopoly go my life had been so much funnier and more woke I never been so attached to my phone just to play monopoly ever in my life so this game is just a thing I like to do when I need to play something that won’t make me feel bored or empty inside I love this game so much,The top 5 reason why this is a game you should download
3,2023-08-11 20:05:17,"Great game I wish it can be up dated where you can be able to exchange gold cards if we can’t exchange them why give duplicated of them , we need to be able to send each other dice , and less time to wait to get more dice instead of waiting and hour please do some up grade and I can give a 5 because this is amazing game just need some minor updates please and than you please can I get a feed back please do some up dates on the game to keep it fun and exciting to keep your customers playing again great game but some serious up dates than I can give the full 5 stars yall deserve thank you advance",Yolanda
3,2023-08-10 08:50:26,"I love this game, but this is ridiculous for the stickers! I’ve opened a ton of stickers from green to pink to only get a bunch 2-3 star sticker dupes. Not even getting four star dupes, but you want me to buy a sticker pack to get a guaranteed card. I literally opened over 10 plus packs and nothing. I’m not saying it should be super easy but if we’re opening that many sticker packs we should at least get a couple of new cards out of that.

I’ve played for awhile now trying to use more patience, but the amount of time it makes you just sit around waiting to be able to roll again is crazy. It makes me wonder if it’s a ploy to make it look like people play it twice as long as they do because it literally takes twice as long, if not more, to play this game with all the waiting on everything they choose to confetti.",Why’s everything about this game so SLOW?!
5,2023-07-22 01:57:12,"its a great game to play especially when you have an obsession with games . My only problem is that I spend too much money on it because there’s not enough rolls to accomplish anything the more levels you excel , it makes it harder to complete boards && collect cards . i Is there any way that yall can make it easier in the future ? like giving more than 50 rolls per board or 7 rolls per hour ? Maybe make the events more achievable ? other than that I have no complaints :) .",I love the game BUT !!!!
3,2023-07-31 00:58:20,"My wife got me started on this game and it’s better than most Tycoon type games (games that you have to spend time in to get anywhere) and it does a good job on making it enjoyable without having to pay to play. My only complaint *DEVLEOPERS PLEASE READ* is the cards you have to collect. You get a lot of repeat cards and the more you collect the harder it is to get what you need to complete set’s, but can you please make rare cards something to trade? It gets to a stall when you have an excess of those cards and can’t trade them. Other than that I think it’s a great game to play to pass time.",Please read to get why 3 stars
3,2023-07-28 22:05:29,"My biggest disappointment is that it wasn’t going to be similar to iMessage games where you could start a game with a few friends you choose and take turns playing as normal but on a digital platform. That would have been EPIC. Now, the game isn’t awful and I do enjoy playing it, getting money and completing the boards - just wish I could choose who to play a game with and it wasn’t all random Facebook friends. Maybe have the option for both? Like an individual platform and then the option to start a game with friends? That would be a sick update!",Wish we could play with friends!

2,2023-07-20 17:12:23,"This game needs to be updated with the stickers. Why keep giving us stickers for sets 1-6 and A Lot of us finished those sets 18 boards ago? The groups you have for Facebook don’t really share stickers, they just like to see how many comments & interactions they get because they get paid for them. When there’s small promotions your not going to win them. “You must land on FREE PARKING to get extra rolls” FREE PARKING is only 10 rolls away, and they give you a 9 or a 11. Or just stop you short 1 back or a head, NO MATTER how many rolls for all types of promotion. But when there’s nothing going on, you land on the spot all the time. You go to jail and NEVER get DOUBLES. Smh this really needs a update",Stickers
4,2023-05-11 18:04:18,"This game is very fun and addicting and helps pass the time. But the developers need to allow us the ability to trade any and all stickers that we get in game. The inability to be able to trade four and five star gold stickers is keeping a lot of us players from completing sticker sets. I get that the developers need to make money and buy not allowing us to trade certain stickers it could force us to have to buy dice to get rolls, which is not fair. Developers please make an update where we can trade any and all stickers and I will change my review to a five star.",Fun and addicting
3,2023-07-14 23:14:02,"The long wait times for dice, the inability to trade certain stickers and no safe place TO trade…kinda making the game lose it’s appeal for me. It’s fun but I find myself maybe logging on just a couple times a day vs. basically monitoring it all day when I first started playing.   Don’t get me wrong, it’s fun to a degree. Attacking opponents cities and seeing how much cash you can stack but like I said after a while with dice getting harder and harder to come by, it starts to lose its appeal. It’s like the higher you go, the less fun it becomes. Soon, I’ll find another game that keeps my attention and forget all about this one.",Losing its appeal
3,2023-07-14 11:32:02,"I initially enjoyed this game, but I soon noticed that the dice rolls seemed to be rigged. When I had higher multipliers, I would consistently land on spaces that took money away from me, or on spaces that gave me no money at all. However, when I had lower multipliers, I would land on money spots more often. This suggests that the game is designed to keep players in the game for longer, perhaps by tracking their data and using it to target them with in-app purchases. I even paid $2.99 for some rolls, but I still noticed that the dice were not working in my favor. Additionally, I landed on jail multiple times, which further frustrated me.",Rigged
4,2023-11-05 06:25:54,"The game is amazing. I’m addicted to playing it. Although I have been getting rather annoyed with it. Getting the same stickers over and over again, never getting gold cards. Events like the spooky event never enough wheels. I have only completed the sets once. Haven’t been able to since. Can never seem to get any new cards and have to wait hours just for my dice to refill. I love the game but it’s getting rather annoying to where I no longer want to play. Hopefully this review helps change some things about the game.",Review
4,2023-11-03 18:04:46,"They post events for players to take part in but to complete said tasks it would realistically take like a week or more to do (unless you play all day every day with no job or life to live outside the game) but the events they host are only 24 and 48 hours, maybe 3 days at most, when the task they assign would be something like land on a certain space 200 plus times or complete 500 wheel spins (when you get maybe one or 2 a day). How is anyone possibly winning these? I don’t even take part in them anymore",It’s alright
4,2023-11-02 17:54:34,"I’m on 154. Game is fun. Getting stickers , having over 2b dollars and not passing a land is annoying. It truly does make you want to quit. The same stickers over and over and over. Now I’ve noticed it’s harder to win tournaments. You land on a railroad bankrupt someone and get 120 hats. Barely even moves to get a gift. I love the partner games ! Just pick good partners. 🤷🏽‍♀️ over all the game is fun. Yesterday I didn’t do much. I had error codes all day.

2,2023-10-16 16:22:44,It’s not that the game wasn’t enjoyable once upon a time. But once you pass board 50ish all landmarks are extremely expensive. Trying to get new stickers is almost impossible. Every tournament is literally impossible to win without putting money into a FREE GAME. There are so many bots and people who either spend mad time on this app or they have the money to buy stickers. I can guarantee no one has completed all albums without purchasing stickers or having multiple accounts. It’s just too the point I’m saying goodbye to the game because it’s just stressful now as opposed to being enjoyable. I hope in the future you make the game more fun to play..,Monopoly No Go!

Since the new album and new updates it's almost impossible to get anywhere without paying money. Don't get me wrong I get that they are in the business of entertainment and making money but honestly it's getting ridiculous. I have spent more money than I want to admit just to try and somewhat compete in tournaments and complete events. It's just not that enjoyable anymore when you can’t get anywhere or feel some sense of accomplishment without spending hundreds of dollars.

Bank heisted by the billions by bots and customer service  never return your well owed money back.

2,2023-08-24 07:24:56,It’s a really fun game to play with friends besides the fact that you can’t really enjoy it unless you add money. Also for one to add money and not get new card after paying real money is crazy. I’m not gonna lie I put over $100 over time on this game and have yet to get a new card in the packs of cards. Most of the cards I need only the game can give them to me but they not giving them to me is crazy. Multiple duplicates of cards that can’t be giving is crazy. Over 10 duplicates of the same card is dumb. Every new board everything increases but the amount of diced rolls giving to start you off. The prices for rolls are ridiculous.,Pay to play type game
3,2023-08-18 15:08:58,The game is very addictive & fun. At least it was but the higher the level the more you have to pay to leave jail which would be fine if you received more money & dice every time you started a location. Every new location is only 50 dice no matter how high up you are. I've been stuck on finishing my sticker pack. It's been a month & I've only needed 2 gold stickers to finish. Ive received over 3 pink packs & still nothing. Meanwhile others are finishing their sticker packs for the 3rd time. And why is it that you can only help 1 person open their community chest?,Could use better rewards
2,2023-08-03 22:33:44,"Honestly the game is fun and entertaining, however, this game no longer provides stickers for the albums they want you to “complete”. The sticker Facebook group is very unhelpful and the game has made it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to obtain new cards. They consistently hand out duplicates of lower cards, to the point where i have stacks of 9+ duplicates. Not to mention, the trading limit for cards is too low, it should be 8-10 a day. Realistically, the events they hold aren’t long enough for most to participate and win first place—thus no purple packed cards are being earned/won. Also, the time limit on roll refills is too long if the events are going to be that short in length of time.",Opportunities
1,2023-08-13 17:04:20,At first I loved the game. Everything was flowing I had dice coming and different cards every time I get a pack of cards. I’ve been playing this game for a month now and I have yet to finish collecting all the sets of cards. After I found out we can trade cards they stop letting us trade the gold ones so I’m just stuck. The challenges where you have to land on a certain tile to get points to get rewards are rigged! During the challenge you barely can land on the spot but once it’s over magically you’re landing on the spot you needed before. And don’t buy cards because they still aren’t new ones that you need. This game was so much fun when I started but I’m definitely gonna delete it now and I encourage you guys to as well!,🙄
2,2023-06-10 19:31:09,"I downloaded the game TODAY, and I just deleted it. Here’s why- So it looked fun in the ad, so I downloaded it, but I didn’t want to sign up for the game so I continued as a guest. So for the people who signed up you won’t have this problem, but the people who want to continue as guest will. I thought there going to be like computers that would play against you, but no. You play Monopoly on your own, and you just keep rolling the dice and nothing happens. So people who don’t want to sign up might have to just play by themselves which is boring.  Anyway I think it would be a good game and fun, but if I could continue as a guest and play against people not myself.  Thank you!",It’s ok but not what I expected…
1,2023-07-25 11:49:53,Look a lot of people are selling five star cards for money ‼️ this has to stop people are reaching 60 and up levels and we are not getting any five star cards and that is insane ‼️ you created a game to have fun and feeling like you have to spend your money or begging other people in the Facebook created group that monopoly provides along with the game (remind you) isn’t worth playing for this is why your uninstall is increasing 🗣️ this makes the game unplayable and repetitive and it becomes boring start giving to people more and ban the ones who are selling your game items for money or holding multiple five star cards because you do have record’s on file and maybe people will start playing more‼️,CARDS BEING SOLD!
2,2023-11-01 03:38:31,"This game is incredibly frustrating with the fact you can only trade cards via Facebook and even when you link Facebook you still can’t trade cards. At least add an option where others on Facebook or locally can trade if it shows what people are needing within the application. Also the game gives the same cards too frequently to the same users, we all have the same cards on the group. The mini games are creative but the odds are better at an actual casino than on this game for any wheel spins. It’s addicting though they got that part down now just tweak the rest.",Low replay ability at higher levels
1,2023-05-08 11:44:03,"At first the game is fun, great playful graphics, even let’s you win big your first couple dice throws to kinda lure you in. Right up until you spend money for additional dice then the game takes a complete turn on you. Your odds for getting huge pay outs with a much higher amount of rolls becomes slim to none, and you’re left with money spent for 1000 dice and all you land on is properties with no real worth. I’m sure the developers do this so that people who roll high stakes at 50x rolls wouldn’t bankrupt unfairly but if that’s the case, why add that to the game at all? The game waits for you to make a real purchase then throws you in the mud and calls it “unlucky.” I deleted the app and I hope anyone else that gets the game reads this first",This game is actually fraud
5,2023-10-29 00:56:01,"Don’t get me wrong this game is fun, but it seems like after the last sticker album reset the game has cut the rewards for completing a set by over half comparatively. Also seems like rewards for completing events has gone down as well as prices for buying extra rolls and money have gone up. I think the developers or admin or whatever need to leave well enough alone and put it back the way it was. Did they think we wouldn’t notice?",Loosen up the in game rewards
5,2023-10-26 20:44:43,I like the game!!! My opinion I think if we had more chances at dice and ways to strategize it would make people stay invested! Let players get more ways to get dice so people play more! It’s in y’all interest the longer players play not lose interest!! That way people could attack more but have dice and wait for the attack and when they want to quit they would have get back on to protect their investment!!!!! Think about it!! I’m open to working for monopoly also just saying!!!,HELp
5,2023-08-03 03:05:42,For about 3 weeks now I haven’t not gotten the 100 rolls you get when a Facebook friend downloads the game. I’ve even checked with mutual Facebook friends and they got the rolls. I did not. I’ve been asking for this to be fixed for awhile now. Even had my uncle download the game yesterday and connect his Facebook and still didn’t get them. Have yet to hear back from someone to fix this issue and correct my missing rolls.,Not getting rolls from having Facebook friends play
4,2023-10-12 01:33:41,"1. I don’t think it’s fair to get un-tradable cards in duplicate and triplicate! Once you get it you should be rewarded with something else. I.E like a wheel spin or dice back.  2. I don’t think someone should be able to continuously target you, I think at best a least 5 times. I’ve been targeted by one person over 20+ times in one day.  3. I feel like event pieces that are left over at the end of the event need to be converted into cards or dice.  4. This is the biggest pet peeve, when doing partner quests or events I think that when you complete the quest the left over points should be allocated to the next person you are working with I.E needing 9k and rolling 20k  instead of losing the 11k it should be transferred to the next person in your competition event.   5. Dice regeneration needs to be shortened, also should be able to skip all animations with a toggle on off feature.",Great game with game breaking issues

On the last day, August 31st, of the last album, a friend gifted me 4 new stickers to complete 4 sets at approximately 1 pm Eastern time.  I NEVER received those cards & I had what looked like blue smoke over the album icon. I would not have completed the album but I would have completed 4 sets which would have equated to over 6000 dice & 800 million in cash.  I have sent complaints over & over & have not gotten any response!  Then when the new album started, the prizes are much lower & now you can only do so many friend invites.

They’re not on my friends list on any social media platform, not in my contact list on my phone, and I’ve never traded with them. The game won’t even allow me to attack back.

Customer Service does not exist, the live game has a significant number of issues when it comes to rewards not being delivered properly as well as in app purchases showing different prices from player to player and then not delivering what was purchased.  While the occasional bug/glitch happens, it should not be as prevalent as it is in this game, it almost feels like an early beta release. Oh and prepare for your dice rolls not to be an actual RNG, you have a chance to land on each spot within 12 spaces and those chances change depending on the event currently running.",Has Potential to be great

As soon as you buy some extras and work to get your bank account up, they’ll have fake players come and steal pretty much anything you have. It’s so you’ll buy more. The stickers are a joke, you won’t complete a set but you’ll have 200 of one you don’t need. All in all it’s a boring game meant to entice you to spend actual money. If you’re going pee and need something to do, it’s an option. Only pee though, because you won’t have enough dice to play longer than 5 minutes a day.

If you run out of dice rolls you are greeting with another 3 pop ups, 2 are for buying more rolls and one is telling you to link your FB or phone to invite friends for more rolls. There is (to my knowledge) no way to turn these pop up off. So if you want to play for a couple minutes while waiting for something.

There’s no chances of getting anything new to complete any of your sets that you have.

3,2023-11-02 17:46:16,"I’ll try to make this brief, this is a list of things that r ridiculous:  • you get 8 dice every hour, that’s just ridiculous. So I have to wait approximately 10 hours to get 80 dice. And you can’t achieve anything with 80 dice • stickers. I’ve completed 10 sticker packs, and I have 10 more packs to complete. After you get about half of those packs you won’t get any new ones. It’s been I think about 1-2 months and I haven’t received a new sticker. And I’ve sent stickers to ppl (through the app, not FB) and I’ve never received stickers from anyone else • the price of the dice. They expect you to pay for dice is ridiculous and makes no sense. They just want money. For 1,400 dice you have to pay 50$. Now if 1,400 Dice got you far I would say great deal! But in reality 1,400 dice is nothing. It goes in 5 seconds.

If you don’t have enough dice to roll again (depending on the dice multiplier you use), you get an ad to buy more rolls. Sometimes this happens 3 or 4 times before I finally run out of dice.

The amount of dice that accumulate within the hour is ridiculous. Having to wait x amount of hours to get all your dice is crazy.  2. The level of difficulty to get sticker albums completed should be lessened or you guys need to stop giving so many duplicates and more of the cards needed. 3. The shields don’t add up in number.

Even that doesn’t seem to work because you keep getting the same stickers over and over again and seems impossible to get the gold stickers you need. How can everyone be looking for the same stickers unless they are only letting a handful of certain ones go out.   The further you get in the game the rewards are not compensated to your level. I am on level 177 and still only get 50 dice and a hardly any $ when finishing a level when it now takes close to $5 billion to complete.

Before this update, what made this game the most fun was the balance between good and bad. At some points I was jumping for joy and others I wanted to cry but that’s what kept getting me to come back to this game, but now, the balance between good and bad has been offset since dice links were extremely effective.",Why did they cap dice links

The little mini games where you land on tokens or landmarks there should be better rewards, I’m specifically talking about card packs. Put more blue and red card packs in those not just green  3. Some times when I get a purple pack and it’s not even a new card in it  I also play dice dreams and it’s similar to your game play and I get way more new cards without having to make a purchase and the duplicate trade is better   There methods for you to acquire new cards a good and you don’t have to make a purchase and it is also an ad free game   I play monopoly go because I love the premise but if you’re just around to price gauge then I will delete the app and stick with Dice Dreams",It’s good but could use some work

3,2023-08-01 13:51:37,"seriously.... the pop ups are crazy. like LITERALLY. when you open the app.... you have to close out like 7 of them back to back of them trying to get you to buy the packages...  1 or 2 would be cool. but it's literally like 7 of them back to back. you can't even get to the game. and by the time you do, you don't even really wanna play anymore it's ridiculous.  same thing happens when you run out of dice. like i wish it was an option to take it off.  i haven't played in weeks cause of this. it's just annoying... i'm waiting for the update or something",the pop-ups are insane
4,2023-07-29 20:43:56,"I’ve been hooked on this game for over a month, did most of the advancing on my own. When it comes to collecting stickers and trading them it seems like the game is rigging certain stickers to be scarce! Joined the Fb trading club that is advertised through the gaming app and it was ok at first but now people are selling stickers for money and on Ebay(out of all sites) and at this point it’s starting to seem like you can’t advance without spending money in some way….but awesome game overall. So many people are playing and it becomes addicting!",‼️Sticker Beware‼️
5,2023-11-10 16:13:57,First off I wanna just say this is the best game ever but I feel like we are waiting to long just to get some dice like could you guys at least put the time down from 1hr to 30minutes and the dice cost way to much pls fix the game and plus I’ve been trying to join the monopoly group on Facebook and it’s not letting me join I am highly disappointed and frustrated about this situation going on with game hopefully you guys put this into consideration,Stop making us wait so long
4,2023-05-29 15:14:55,"I love me a good game. I especially love Monopoly, which is a board game I play with my family quite often still. So when they had it on the phone, we all started playing through our gadgets. But now its ni longer fun, it’s like you can’t successfully grab all the stickers needed for the album without purchasing in app with hopes you’ll get the sticker you need. So many duplicates given. Give us dice please! Its hard to break 1k without purchasing. I thinj I may be done after this set of stickers reset, it’s become stressful! Lol",This was fun until it wasn’t
4,2023-05-17 19:14:48,"I tried this game because a friend told me to try it, and I was really having fun, until I asked him: “When you get a building shut down do they actually steal the amount of money they get?” He said no. But a few days later he said that actually yes and for that reason we both got rid of it. Because you could have someone 2 places ahead of you that could steal all you have and make you go bankrupt without even knowing. I’m not sure if this was actually correct or not, but if it is, please fix it. I really liked this game.",Pretty good
3,2023-11-11 23:30:31,We love this game my whole family and all of my friends play but some of the challenges seem impossible. Making us trade to get stickers is so difficult and you get scammed constantly. The customer service is awful and slow and when they do help it doesn’t even make up for a loss. The game glitches occasionally which can be so frustrating especially since we put cash into the game.  I also hate fighting to earn a reward just to get 10 minutes of higher multiplier or another green pack. There has to be better rewards so we can complete our albums.,Addictive
5,2023-10-21 02:19:28,"Monopoly GO is a unique, interesting game that provides a competetive element against friends and family. Set with the backdrop of the classic game Monopoly, it takes a twist on the classic gameplay, but uses the same board. The user interface is simple and easy, and the game is effortlessly engaging. Better yet, this game is also great for those with little time; there are features that allow you to complete your daily tasks quickly and efficiently. Build up your monopoly today!",Engaging classic
3,2023-11-02 14:00:31,"Okay so I do love this game and I’ve put a crazy amount of time into this game but I’ve still never once won a token or a shield from the events because I don’t spend money, I do think it’s a little too hard to play without spending money. Also why are stickers so hard to get? I haven’t finished an album in a long time because there’s certain stickers that no one can seem to get! Everyone I know that plays agrees. Also a lot of these links to freebies that I get sent to me don’t work on my iPhone and I'm not sure why since they work for everyone else.",Something I’d like to say
5,2023-10-08 22:02:01,I love the monopoly go game ! The only things I don’t like is you guys don’t give us enough dices ! You guys took the number of dices down for us completing a sticker set . I also think that we should do a partner event 2 or 3 times out of a month to make the game more interesting and fun because I really love the partner tournaments games . That give us a chance to help out our friends more on dices when they are running low . Overall I love this game I’m glad they came up with it .,Interesting facts !!
5,2023-08-27 03:31:17,I adore this app and have been playing it religiously every day for the past few months of course there were some parts that needed to be a little faster with the animations however I feel like everything is in super speed mode and I blow threw rolls extremely fast and I feel like I don’t get to enjoy the roll of the dice and the game quite as much. Overall the game remains amazing and fun I just wish everything wasn’t speed up so much.,Update is almost too fast
4,2023-09-28 17:35:35,It’s a fun decent game the only problems I have are that they give you duplicates of gold cards and we can’t even trade them I feel like if y’all are gone give us extra gold stickers we should be able to trade them. Another problem is I don’t like the fact it takes an hour to load 8 dice and I don’t think that’s fair y’all should at least do 30 and also they give way to many duplicate stickers when there are too many stickers that we still need. We also should get more trades a day,Monopoly go
1,2023-09-27 05:29:25,"It seems to be nothing more than a slot machine disguised as Monopoly. No skill or intelligence required, just repeatedly tap the Go button and hope it gives you more dice. I could be brain dead and drooling with a nervous twitch and still play this. Sure, the graphics are nice, but it’s utterly pointless. It’s designed to get kids to spend their mommy and daddy’s money on dice refills. Even if I were brain dead, I wouldn’t spend a dime on this. I’m waiting for it to eventually bankrupt me so I can uninstall it and go back to the actual real game (which cheats, but actually requires some logical thought). I’m just trying to figure out the point of it all other than just a mindless money grab.",What exactly is the point of this game?
1,2023-09-26 18:27:18,"Several times now I opened up a gift box to reveal a multiplier for a certain number of minutes and it never shows up anymore. I also got duplicate gold stickers in the gift pack we were given for the technical difficulties. It's so rigged. I could be landing on railroads all day then a tournament starts where I get tokens towards prizes if I land on railroads and then I never land on then again. It happens every time. Also with the quick wins, in the morning I can land on railroads for the shut downs. Then I open up the quick win where landing on a railroad for a shutdown is a requirement and it takes me all day to land on it again. I don't know why I still play. So close to deleting honestly!!",Monopoly go? More like Monopoly NO!!!
2,2023-09-20 17:29:37,"I downloaded this game to play with my family through our Facebook accounts. It has now just become a chore. Even when you seem to have a decent amount of dice, it is NEVER enough. In order to have a good amount of dice, you have to pay. Don’t even get me started on stickers and getting sticker packs. I’ve been stuck for weeks because I am not able to get higher up in daily tournaments. The creators said it would be easier to finish sets, but it’s not! Be prepared to spend money if you want to do anything worth awhile in this game. I’m on the brink of deleting it because of how bored I’ve gotten",Only play if you want to waste time
1,2023-09-05 18:38:31,"If you’re new to the game, enjoy it for the first few levels. Then you’ll find out that even though you have to spend WAY more Monopoly cash to upgrade your landmarks, you still only get 50 dice when you finish the board, whether it’s level 1, 51 or 101. Then when you go around the board, you’ll find out that you have to go around hundreds of times to get enough for upgrading, but you’re still only earning 8 dice an hour. That’s less than 200 dice in a day, so 10-20 rolls for the average player. It should take you, on average, 6 rolls to go around the board once. So three times around the board, needing to hit specific squares, which you seem ti always miss by one. I’m done.",Wish I could give zero
5,2023-08-26 02:31:47,I love playing this game definitely is a cool take on monopoly and is nice to be able to play alongside friends and family too. I’ve noticed it’s been a little glitchy but that’s to be expected. I did however run into an issue tonight where I was in jail rolled double 5s x20 but the game froze and never gave me the dice I would’ve earned for getting out of jail… I tried to see how I could report that it froze but got nowhere with the customer service page.,Great game just a little glitchy
4,2023-08-09 02:14:15,I love the game it’s very addicting! You collect a lot of money. But the rolls are ridiculous you get 50 rolls for upgrading to a new board. Also the stickers that they give you they start off giving you new ones ofc until you complete the set but then it’s sooo hard to complete them. I’m on level 56 and I have over 10 of the same stickers but NO new ones in weeks! I think that’s just ridiculous why not give us new stickers? Even in the gift they just give you the same stickers making it hard to finish the sets.,Great game
3,2023-08-25 02:36:39,"Once I got to board 38 I stopped getting any new stickers in any of the packs, vaults, etc. I’m on board 43 now and doesn’t matter if I save up my extra stickers for any of the vaults I still never get any new ones. And the ones I do receive from the vaults never go towards my extras. They just kinda disappear. How are we supposed to clear the album if you’re not giving out all the stickers?  Also, the amount of money & dice you get for clearing each board should go up each time. I mean if jail costs more each time we should get more money and dice when we clear a board.",Fun but needs work
4,2023-08-08 18:17:11,"Pretty dope game let’s start there, but come on be for real y’all made it hard to get some stickers man. Like you got people selling stickers in the lil group y’all have linked to the game people scamming and stuff y’all gotta do better. Update tweak the game do something but all your pink packs should at least include one new sticker if not 2. And omg when we open the vault that should at least give us new stickers and not so many duplicates. But I like the game tho giving off coin master vibes but hey it’s a lot more fun. So yea y’all need to see bout the sticker situation.",Do better!
4,2023-07-08 04:00:28,"I just downloaded this game just today and I’m already loving it! There are no adds and It’s a great time to spend time with ur family because I have a lot of family that plays this game! But there is one thing that kinda bugs me. I can’t figure out how to friend people! I followed the instructions right and it still doesn’t show. But it shows on the other person screen! I think it is just a tiny bug because it works for other people but not me, but overall it’s a great game and I totally recommend!",Good game! But 1 issue!
3,2023-07-17 02:56:13,"This game is fun if you’re needing something to pass time, or a game that you can play with family and friends. My biggest complaint is the number of times you receive duplicate cards that you don’t need versus the amount of times that you receive cards you actually need to complete a set. I’ve even started spending money in hopes to receive new cards and nope I continue to receive duplicates. This seems to be an issue amongst the groups that I’m apart of if there’s away to kind of balance this out it would be greatly appreciated,",Something to do if you’re looking to past time
2,2023-07-05 19:42:12,I’ve been playing for 2 weeks now and today I decided to play and in the middle of playing it just gives me a error message stating that an error Accor sorry have to restart game. Then it’ll restart load only to stop at 30% I just won the Fourth of July 1 place prize and doing well in the friends baking contests but cannot continue because the game won’t open. There’s no update and I am up to date. How can this issue be solved?! Other than that I’ll give it 5 but as of now I cannot because I cant enjoy the game and right where I’m winning competitions and have loads of rolls to play the game is acting funky so yes I’m a little agitated,Error message can’t play
5,2023-11-02 20:39:13,It’s so hard to build a car cause there’s not enough options to get the wheels or whatever we need to build as a player I feel like we need better earnings and same goes for the stickers I love playing the game but I’m really turned off cause we are loyal players but not getting loyal treatment!!! Monopoly GO! You guys need to help us out and change some things around for your customers to be more comfortable playing,Building a car and completing the stickers
3,2023-07-05 17:56:44,This bake a cake game is extremely inventive but it’s to the point where so many people are playing for the prizes hoping to compete stickers since most of the really good ones you can only get by trading someone I can’t even login to play and compete for the prize it keeps stopping its load at 30% and giving me the error message I’m not sure if I could have one the prizes given for this competition but it’s crazy that I can’t even get in the game to play this is my biggest and really only issue other than giving new stickers out more often and just make more albums to collect,Glitching
2,2023-06-03 01:56:07,The game is great. I love it but there are too many pop ups asking for money and even ones not asking for money. Every time you open the game you get 3-6 pop ups asking you to spend money. Every single time you open something you get a massive unskippable pop up. Every single time you run out of rolls you get 3-4 pop ups asking you to spend money. And they all have the button to close them in a different place. It’s obnoxious and incredibly irritating. If it weren’t for those popups I’d rate the game 5/5 but with how obnoxious and downright annoying how much money they’re asking for it honestly makes me not want to even play the game.,Too Many Pop-Ups!!!
2,2023-11-11 14:39:57,"This game is super fun and addictive but that momentum is quickly diminished when you emerge your eagerness want to constantly play. And that comment is PRIMARILY surrounded by the VAST amount of SCAMMERS!!! They take all the fun out of it. By either the luck of the draw or out right paying for packages to get certain cards, and someone SCAMS you out of what you’d hope to be an honest trade.   MoGo people if you happen to see this. Protect your players. There is an interest to continue to support but I will be sadly uninstalling until there is some type of trade protection portal created. Just a thought but why not create some type of trade portal where Both players submit the cards to be traded which AUTOMATICALLY SECURES the card from each player’s inventory. Once both players agree on the cards to be traded the deal is finalized.   Other things to consider: -Increase daily trades to 8 - increase the roll capacity to 1,000. I do not know what you think people could do with 80 dice.   *The gold trades capability was GREAT!!",Protect your PLAYERS!
5,2023-09-28 21:49:10,This game is an amazing game only thing i hate is the fact that people can target you every single time i feel like there should be a cooldown on when you can attack the same person because you can have full shields and go to sleep and wake up to none and you’re whole board destroyed because the same person kept attacking you till you had no shields/ your whole board was broken. Also there should be a Dice geab.  Cash grab is boring,Amazing game
3,2023-11-02 01:41:29,"So first off, i get silenced for a day as “punishment” for copying wheel and dice links.. we wouldnt have to do that if you would make it a slight but easier to get them.. then your game is constantly glitching and wasted tons of ppls money and time and effort that they put in during tournaments, and all you give is 500 wheels??? Then you use those and your multiplier just to land on 160 or 80 even when you clearly see the wheel was stopped at the higher one and then magically click’s over to the lower amount..🤔 also may i add i had my multiplier at 100 and landed in 1000 and it barely moved,",Cheated
3,2023-10-23 13:24:44,"Fun game but try to make not so obvious with it being rigged. No matter how much dice anyone has. If you’re getting close to a big dice reward you’re gonna come up short so they make you pay. I will never pay for a game but you could tell is rigged I have multiple accounts and when I finish the daily wins. I get the same gold card for all counts, and when I hit the community chess me and my family we all hit it one day and then the others hit it the day after. Just make it a fun game instead of trying to make it rigged. If it wasn’t rigged, I would probably pay money.",Fun but rigged
3,2023-10-08 01:24:28,"I’m sick and tired of having very little control over the game. You roll dice and the game moves you. Landing on railroads is eminent. The building games are impossible. Have yet to win. The most recent Toy Making was impossible. You need to design so that you can change partners as mine was non performing. It would be nice if one could choose same partner for more than one section. The game is too controlling with little choice in the game or levels, “extras” are very expensive to purchase. Sticker collection is impossible. I will likely resolve my ties with game if something doesn’t change soon.",Poor gaming
4,2023-09-04 23:49:54,I really like monopoly go it’s so much fun to play and it’s addictive. But I don’t really like the fact that you run out of dice really quickly and it is very annoying when you run out of dice and it takes forever for the new dice to come and you only get five dice then you have to wait a hour for the dice to come. Other than this one mistake I really love monopoly go it’s really fun and if you will find out how to fix it I will continue playing forever and I know it is probably very hard but it is just a suggestion thank you.,Pretty good
1,2023-09-20 03:05:43,"Waiting hours to fill up your dice bar is a stupid move and then being money grubby to desperate people who barely have enough money to buy dice by showing these stupid ads and deals is not the way to go. Y’all make it impossibly difficult to get your album finished especially with no ability to get your gold star stickers. And to top it off, y’all removed the methods of making it seemingly “fair” for everyone by not allowing more than fifty people invited. This is a completely unfair game and if I cannot finish this album again after having been 2 gold cards short the last one, you’ll be losing more and more players. It’s a stupid tactic and not going to work out for you Scopely.",Unfair
2,2023-09-19 23:41:09,"So, the game is fun! But waiting an hour for 8 dice and only getting an accumulation of 80 is painful. You fly through those before you can even win anything, or even any tournaments. Don’t get me started on these recycled packs of cards that give out one star cards at the highest level. It should be more accesible it isn’t fun anymore and quite frankly WE NEED MORE DICE! This waiting game is boring, I used to sign on a couple hundred times a day and now I’m down to maybe twice a day. There’s no fun the rewards are minimal and so are the star packs. We asked for dice you guys gave us Sheild stickers, capped us at our fB friend limit and we still can’t even trade golds.",Ridiculous

I was a few spots away from the goal. I just had to land on any utility, 3 times. they toke $100 dollars from me had me rolling the dice at lease 200 plus times at X3 and still never land on no utility, know y? they want more money, and time is running out.

4,2023-08-21 14:24:35,"I love this game & it would be 5 stars if y’all made it easier to get gold stickers, I’ve been getting duplicate after duplicate for weeks, rarely getting new cards that I need to complete my albums & also we should be able to trade them… why do we get duplicates of them if we can’t? But yeah that’s it, besides one ACTUAL suggestion, start making the money harder to get so that we can buy dice with it, we ALWAYS need dice & y’all make the challenges hard enough on the people who have work & class😭 please help us",Four stars because..
3,2023-08-16 02:56:37,This game is fun and all but you run out of dice so fast. If you want to progress you basically have to buy dice. You get like 7 dice an hour up till 70 and those go by so fast because you have to use a multiplier on the dice if you want to progress. It’s a fun game but the dice are the core of it and if you don’t have them or buy them then it’s pointless. Also the algorithm of the cards are ridiculous. It is by the grace of God if you get a new card. It’s all repetitive and I shouldn’t have multiple of gold cards that I can’t even trade or send. The game needs fixing,A better way to get dice and cards
1,2023-08-16 23:43:38,"The game is mind-numbingly boring, and you’re constantly doing the same things over and over and over again. There’s no gameplay dynamic besides “roll dice, build things to progress, smash and steal other people’s stuff sometimes.” I initially played this when it was first released, and I played for a while in hopes that something different might happen, but it never came. So, I uninstalled, and reinstalled today because my girlfriend started to play it. Friends serve very little purpose, if any, and there’s not much you can even do with them. The gameplay is also still exactly the same as it was when I first played, so the end result will still be the exact same.",Where’s the appeal?
3,2023-08-13 06:14:25,"The game is fully as advertised! The problem is how stingy this game is with stickers and actually being able to play. it take 6-8(!!) hours to replenish your rolls which doesn't make sense… dont you want me to play? and then there are no guarantees in terms of getting new stuff as opposed to the same thing over and over. im still playing for now but the game is easy to get sick of if you don’t have people yk irl playing it🤷🏾‍♂️. like some other people ive seen, if i dont complete the sticker album(kinda the whole point of the game) im gonna delete the game. heres hoping this company experiences bankruptcy 😁",cheap devs
1,2023-08-15 15:10:04,This game is ridiculous if you don’t spend money you won’t catch up on building anything they just take everything you build .. shields are a scam you get win multiple shields one person attempts to knock down a building all the shields go away doesn’t add up . When you try to disconnect from the game so your Facebook & personal info they make you go through a email system just to disconnect from the game (and it’s difficult nothing simple) real scamish. When you delete the game nothing but pop up for the game come up on different app . From them knowing your information & data . Gotta be careful with these apps & read the fine print about agreements cause your info is sold peridot,Low key scam
1,2023-08-13 08:17:42,"This game is not for you to have fun it’s for them to make money that’s it that’s all! It’s set up to make you think you’re getting closer to a goal just to have you waste rolls at the end trying to convince you to spend money also if you do spend money you have to spend at least 2$ or more and the value doesn’t add up you never get cards you need, nothing in place to stop scammers it’s just a huge money grab app i wish they would fix it now that they made their money but being greedy will eventually cost them less traffic in the long run they’ll be losing money they could’ve made last!  I can go on and on how obviously rigged this game is had sooo much potential",Extremely rigged!!!
3,2023-08-12 03:26:38,I Been playing for 2 months . The game is fun but Monopoly needs to fix the game to where we can trade Gold Cards . Not only That stop giving US so many repeating cards in the same pack as well. I’m on level 5k as the boards And Levels increase They need to increase the Prize amount because it gets really expensive to build more . I’m also in the MonopolyGO trading group And we complain about that all the time so if they were to Fix The Game it will be a lot better And keep The Players interested. Oh yeah last But Not least give is More than 8 dice per Hour !,The game is addicting but not rewarding
5,2023-06-26 20:59:22,So I go into monopoly like I do everyday and it says it needs to update. So I update it and when I went back it everything is frozen nothing works. This is the one game I play everyday and now because of an update it no longer lets me play very unhappy.    Ok.  I deleted the game redownloaded it and recovered game through Facebook. Was still frozen for a while but I let it sit for a bit and it caught up with it self and is working perfect again. Feeling better now lol!!!!   I love this game!,Update failure
3,2023-08-06 06:01:13,"The game at first was a little boring but I pushed myself to play to help a friend. Then got addicted. Down side is the max dice you get per hour (for me) is 8 dice… what am I supposed to do with 8 dice over 1 hour?? It needs to be changed to maximized dice every hour or change it to every 15-20 minutes. Another thing is the prizes. I love the drop game but once you complete it you can’t go any further, I think if you complete it, it should reset. Also the prizes on the wheel spin should be better especially if you are higher up the map. Main point is we need more dice and better prizes.",Love and hate
2,2023-07-31 09:41:53,"The game is okay. I don care for the pop-ups to buy things every time you enter the app. Let us click it if we want. Also some of the animation is extra. What is the point of clicking collect twice, it’s not like we can not collect it. We should hit it once time and then it’s a go.   I also don’t like that this games allows people to cheat. They constantly attack people but don’t build up their board for people to attack back. They wait and do it all at once. That is enough to make me want to stop playing. I think if people don’t have anything on their board to get revenge, they shouldn’t be able to attack.",The game is cool. Hate the pop ups
5,2023-09-19 02:17:47,"I had the game for several weeks. It is addictive, fun. It is buggy. You don’t always get the number of rolls, dice, money that you really should earn. That is not why I deleted the game. They have something called stickers that is really set up poorly. Still not why I quit. Total strangers can target you and be really mean about it and there is no way for you to communicate with them. I was having a great time enjoying it by myself. Total strangers truly ruined it for me.",Strangers

You roll, get money, destroy people’s buildings/heist and that’s it. You can’t pick properties to buy or do auctions. So there’s not any challenge with players to trade deeds with. You can’t buy railroads, and so many chance cards are just…positive results with prizes, nothing bad. Game does all math for you. No challenge. You can’t even chose to build houses and which properties get them! And it doesn’t build evenly which annoys me. It’s all just automated for you. And if pressing GO is hard enough on you, you can do auto roll. I think I might just shell out $4.99 for classic monopoly.",Lazy-opoly!! Come and play!
1,2023-04-14 20:38:05,"This is the most boring version of monopoly available.  It is just auto-roll for five minutes a day, to collect boring stickers that are do nothing interesting.

Graphics are mediocre, it’s not a strategy or competitive game, in any way, whatsoever.  It is auto-roll for a few minutes, then five offers to buy more rolls.  Monopoly is meant to be fun, competitive and a strategy game.  This version, does not have a single one of those qualities and it’s literally, in my opinion, the worst monopoly game version, I have ever played.",Extremely Boring (Cash Grab)
2,2023-11-02 19:06:33,I love this game at first but then when you get to certain levels around 140ish they just repeat levels and it it takes a lot to get new stickers. No one cares about repeat stickers we want more new stickers. They don’t have a McDonalds level and McDonalds has had Monopoly for almost 20 years. Plus the packages popping up in the game every few minutes when you are out of rolls is so dang annoying. They really want you to buy packages and I’m sorry no game is worth it. If I want to buy something I will click on it no need for them to pop up every few minutes. Both my husband and I already deleted this.,Fun at first
1,2023-11-01 17:48:55,Every time I upgrade a landmark the game force closes. Sometimes it will save my progress sometimes it won’t. Those events like the spooky cars. You have to collect wheels and if you don’t have like a million dice you won’t get that many wheels. Also the amounts on the spinner don’t even make a significant difference unless you do like a times 300 multiplier but you don’t get enough wheels for that unless you’re playing this game all day AND spending real money on it. The sticker issue is terrible. You get 50 of the same stickers and rarely ever get anything else. The developers need to take this game back to the drawing board. This is my second time deleting the app and I won’t be redownloading.,Horrible Game
4,2023-10-09 16:02:01,"It’s a fun game to play with your family and friends. Get on once or twice a day to play. Laugh at destroying properties or stealing a little money and that’s it. My biggest issue is how thirsty the devs are for your money and it’s not even good deals especially the longer you’ve played and how they shove it in your face that they want you to buy it. I don’t want to pay $3 for a measly 20-30 rolls, If there was a bonus reward Event pass maybe I’d consider it but definitely not the “deals” they want you purchase.",Fun but stop asking me to pay
2,2023-10-08 19:17:05,I think the dice don’t generate fast enough . Sometimes it takes awhile for me to protect myself. Also why keep giving the same cards over and over again and make it seems as if you have to purchase packs or dice to get cards you need and even then it’s repetitive cards that you already have.  When your doing the building events they make you put it on a high multiplier and it still only moves a lil bit and u have to do 4 of them.    At first it was fun but we keep moving on with no goals.  Why we can’t send dice to our friends or extra puzzle pieces.  It’s started off fun now it’s getting boring.,Getting Boring now!
1,2023-09-30 05:16:14,"First of all, this is one of the greatest games I’ve ever seen. And they have this sticker album collection nonsense where people have to get online to trade stickers in order to complete their albums in order to get the prizes. That sounds all well and good, but they’ve allowed scammers and thieves to come in and ruin all of that for people who are just trying to have some honors fun. Once you get past a certain level, you have to pay a lot of money or find someway to cheat the system in order to move ahead. Since I’m not a cheater, I pretty much don’t make any progress now.

Can’t you find and fix the issue??? It’s already feeling like it’s hopeless to advance much further in the game due to the game appearing greedy with the dice!!

I’m tired of the algorithm that refuses to land on what I need. I’m tired of not having stickers to trade. It’s such a great game but i play every day and still haven’t received a 5 star card. You work so hard to get your weekly prize, just to be the same gold card you already acquired. The excitement was great initially but now, I’m over it. Good luck to the rest of the tycoons that stay on. Keep the game alive, iGuess.",Tired of getting the same cards
5,2023-08-27 18:03:39,This is a great game since childhood the only game we look for during Christmas time it would really bring back memories if you were really playing with all real people and not Ali’s the reward with collecting all the cards will never be rewarded to a actual person but all that being said it is a great game my advice is don’t get addicted like me where you spend your grocery money for the week to buy dice in order to get the last cards you need for more prizes best game ever,Good game
1,2023-09-14 01:10:36,"Scopely Inc. is just another company that prioritizes maximizing profits and could care less about optimizing user experience. They love to throw in-game purchases in your face everytime you load the app. They don’t even try to hide their greedy scheming, and it’s evident in how this new Epic Myths update turned out. Impossible to obtain gold stickers, and with the addition of a plethora of silly sticker packs namely the half golds, they made all of our chances of getting golds in regular packs less then 0.001%. The pricing of these in game purchases is insanely abhorrent and greedy. $30 for some digital stickers and rolls, $60 for a digital guaranteed sticker. Who would be in their right mind to spend money like that in this economy for a endless cycle of nothingness.",Sigh
1,2023-09-07 22:43:41,I started playing the game with the previous set of stickers. It was fun and you received most of what you needed to continue. Now that there is a new set of stickers it has become very difficult to get any set complete. I have 5 sets ready to complete but I need a gold card and those I barely get. I get lots of duplicates of the regular stickers and the gold cards I do have. The amount of dice you get in return is horrible too before each set had a decent amount. This game went from being fun even with paying for extra dice to a big disappointment even though I have spent a decent amount of money for dice. I think it’s time to delete it.  Good Luck to those of you still playing.,Horrible

For only one items I want? Thats asinine! It’s a way to force people into paying a high price for something.

The only thing is, every time I try to purchase something in the app it will charge my card but then the app freezes and I have to close it out. Then when I reopen it and try and go to the board I just bought it says it still needs to be purchased. It’s really frustrating cause I love this game and twice now have paid for something on it to only have it freeze and still not gain access to it. Just a little disappointing.",Good but mine has some bugs
1,2023-08-29 02:21:38,I don’t understand why all you give me is the exact same stickers. Then you give multiple of the gold stickers that can’t be gifted. But when I get enough stars to exchange the duplicate stars you in return give me back duplicate stickers it’s annoying. Then I was told you have to buy the stickers to get the actual ones you need so I spent 20 dollars to get stickers and still got duplicate stickers. It’s annoying! They the groups for sticker trading either need the same stickers you need or the are scamming people to get the stickers they need! It’s literally sucking the fun out of the game! Maybe I should stick to the actual board game because this is giving me gray hairs,I have a love hate relationship with this game
2,2023-08-24 19:06:26,I got this game and was really enjoying but now I like never get new stickers. I’ve been playing this game for weeks and for a few weeks I’ve only gotten like 2 maybe 3 new stickers even saved up for the 500 star box not a single new sticker then turned around and got the 100 with what was left and not a single new sticker. How am I suppose to complete sticker sets when I never get new stickers. I even okay with family members and we share stickers with each other but we never have stickers to share because we all need the same stickers but aren’t getting them because we never get new stickers .,Not getting new stickers
5,2023-07-29 01:16:21,This game is so great I love the empire building and all the different map themes. I also love that they are using the real board. As someone who loves playing the board game and a lot of the mobile apps this is the best app plus the art is cute. I do wish you could teleport back to past maps through the map button. This app is great but I wish you could teleport to past maps through map button thanks for a great app.,Love the game but please make me be able to go back to old maps
2,2023-08-23 19:34:32,Was fun and very addictive in the beginning. Now it’s boring. Album is kind of stupid to get multiple of gold you can’t trade. Dice come few far and between. Side games are all the same over and over and the fact that I take more time then they give to get actual get to the top prizes. Used to play on breaks and I’m down time now it’s not worth it cause nothing interesting about just going around the board collecting money and paying taxes waste of dices rather play the real board game with friends I pick at least I’ll feel like I’m playing with someone other then a computer cause it feels like computer player mode.,Beginning fun end dumb
5,2023-10-12 22:21:42,"This game has been amazing and addictive but the one thing I hate is that as soon as you finish the first 9 packs in the sticker album, you NEVER get new cards. I’ve had 154 card since probably 3-4 weeks after this event started.  I truly think they should update this feature and make it just a little easier to gain new cards.

There are always glitches and 150 dice doesn’t count up to people spending money to hold their spot in tournament and then get locked out. People spam you for cards and their is no customer support.

But after reading a few reviews, I’ve got to agree that some things need to change to keep players coming back.   1. Roll regeneration: someone said that with it only regenerating between 5-8 die an hour is not enough and I agree. I lose interest very quickly when I only see I have 8 rolls after an hour.   2. Trades: we need more than 5 trades a day, that’s only enough to complete half an album of cards if you’re lucky. Also we need to be able to trade gold border cards, what am I going to do with multiple of them if I can only make a set once? Yes I could recycle them but then there’s the voice in the back of my head going. “Someone else probably needs this.”   3. More rolls as rewards as you head up the boards.

There are so many glitches with the app, ones that cause you to lose all progress/status, which is literally the point of playing the game.  When you reach out for technical support, you literally get no response.  After spending  several hundred dollars on in-game purchases, my board has been completely stuck in a loop with no access.

3,2023-09-09 01:41:15,If you like being inundated with pop ups offering to sell you more rolls Monopoly Go is for you.  As with so many games the return when you win is so small you will soon run out of rolls.  Then if you wait for a specific period of time you get 5 free rolls. But as another review stated the game can be addictive and you may not want to wait and buy a package of rolls. I have done that more than once and the rolls don’t last long. The graphics are nice but I don’t see how you win.  So I am deleting the app and letting Angry Birds Pop get my game money.,Another game to take my money with very little return
4,2023-08-29 21:06:44,I love the game it’s definitely addictive. I do think there should be some changes .  I think when you level up you should get dice the higher your level the higher the amount.  When you have a higher level I think your prizes and your reward spin options should be better. I have spent lots of money on this app cause it’s so addictive but not going to do it anymore. Even if I personally got better gifts like really important stickers for one and dice for two I would still purchase things.,Love the game

3,2023-06-13 21:46:02,"It’s tough writing this review because while they have build a very smooth game, it has almost nothing to do with monopoly and if anything the Monopoly references make it more confusing. Most confusingly is that many of the reviews say it’s the most authentic take on monopoly in the App Store, which suggests to me the reviews are all fake.  Basically you build “landmarks” while destroying your opponents landmarks, and when you land on places on the board you either make money or have random things happen. If you go into this game expecting monopoly you’ll be disappointed",Almost nothing to do with monopoly

The rotation of the gameplay, the RNG factors, the PVP mini games and much more is all done really well and is very simple to grasp!  I love the concept of the sticker packs you collect being a sort of seasonal model. 82 days until the next sticker collection or “season” is out, you have the said time to collect the entire collection for a great set of rewards. There are also short term events or challenges you could say to get bonus sticker packs!  Overall this game is worth playing to me, but I will always take a star off for the aggressive MTX (micro transactions) in mobile games but everyone expects it at this point. If you’re smart about your purchases and you can justify the worth of the said pack, then go for it, just be careful.",The perfect mobile Tycoon!
3,2023-06-08 15:48:16,Overall this game is fine. I like the way things play out up until the card trading. The game emphasizes on trying to trade with friends or join groups on Facebook but I’m sure just like everyone else we are missing 1 sticker from the set but can’t trade for it because it’s gold. What’s the point of trading or giving away stickers if the only ones you can trade are the common ones that everyone already has. Again the game plays fine it’s a fun concept but the stickers need to be tuned up so everyone can trade ANY sticker regardless of the fact it’s gold or not.,This game needs a tuneup

Buying dice you’ll pay far more for way less, along with events the game has, the game seems to deliberately make you avoid getting onto certain spots or the spots you need. You can go around the board about 10-20x before you even hit the spot you want.  Events they do are almost a waste of time, the moment you’re close to finishing it, you can bet x10-x30 on the steering wheels for the car event and they give you the LOWEST ones until you run out.

Also they tell you to get more dice and certain cards is to win events. in order to win events you MUST have 10-15k dice. they want you to spend $99 on big package which isn't big enough to win an event.

2,2023-09-28 16:19:37,The game is coo for what it is but it does cheat like if you count your dice and the roll most times it’ll either give you a space more or take one. Plus it doesn’t make sense when you roll to get outta jail you don’t get all your dice. And it seems like every time there’s an event happening you rarely land on the places with the circles. I also don’t like how you only get a small amount of rolls per hour. And I think there should be a card shop that you can trade your old cards to because do the vault does nothing but give you repeat cards.  Another thing is the app is constantly glitching or not loading.,Needs a lot of work

Idk how a rando can even heist you when, from my experience, 100% of YOUR heists are going on to target people in your friends list leading me to believe until I’m able to heist someone outside of my friends list, this was either a cheater or a dev bot cleaning up players money so you can spend real money to try and get your in game money back.

3,2023-09-05 12:38:47,I like the game when it first started. When you finished stickers it gave you more dice. With the new stickers you get less dice the higher the boards you finish you still only get 50 dice building the boards cost more money and it cost more and more to get out of jail and the less doubles you get. I went around the board five time and every time I got around there to jail I landed on it and not one double.  I am just saying I was in love with this game and thought it was the bomb but the new upgrade with different stickers and less dice is wack and now it’s just like if I play I play t,Review
3,2023-09-01 17:15:37,"I started playing about 30 days ago… In that time I was able to complete the last album. with great rewards. Unfortunately, with Epic Myths that might now be the case. Each album has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS dice rewards as the previous album. As well as each set requires a gold card. We all know how hard good cards are to get. So why give us less of a chance to actually complete it?     Packs to buy dice have gotten more expensive… I would put money into the game but packs and dice were expensive before. Now I can’t justify spending the money. $5 for 80… thats just not fair.",Epic Myths
1,2023-08-31 20:29:57,"They only want your money, they do not listen to feedback , the new album is worse even after countless of players have been complaining about their practices, they took all the complaints and did the exact opposite. Their customer support is absolutely awful and practically impossible. Apparently as impossible for them to remove gold cards, allow them to be traded, or not allow duplicates. Rather they added one to every pack. If you are looking for a free game or one that isn’t asking for a kidney, there are plenty of games literally identical to this that aren’t as greedy. Some packs go up to or exceed 100$. Pay to win without the guarantee to win.",Developers don’t care about you
2,2023-08-20 13:49:27,Okay where do I start this game is very addictive as you all can see but this a pay to play game. If your not buying dice to stay on top of everything you would be stuck waiting 10 hours just to refill dice and another thing what’s with the sticker albums why receive duplicate of gold stickers if you can’t trade them. Than the trading group that you all made for trading is not a fair group when everyone is not being fair when it comes to trading… So I’m writing this to state this might be my last time playing due to the fact this game algorithm could be a lot better when it comes to actual game play,Overall review
1,2023-08-15 17:23:19,"The game initially starts out as fun. However, you realize quickly that if you are not spending money, you will not get the stickers needed in order to progress. I have a literally been waiting to complete sets for months and the only way that the sex can be completed is if the game gives me golden stickers, they will give me everything but the ones I need they continuously give you duplicates and there’s continuous errors on the game. I have made purchases and not received the prizes for my purchases. You have to wait a week for customer service to reach out and they never fix the problem or gave me compensation for what was paid for don’t waste our time.",Don’t waste your time!
1,2023-07-16 15:13:48,"Yes, you get rewards and prizes and a lot of things to work towards. It was extremely fun and addicting in the beginning but now it's disappointing because all of that hard work doesn't earn you any new things!! You get to a point that if you Dont spend money you can't progress like everyone else does and I for one am not rich and can not afford to drop hundreds of dollars on a game just to earn the top prizes. Not being able to trade gold stickers is the worse part of the game!! What's the point of having gold stickers and cashing in “an investment” if you get a whole lot of the same stuff in return.

You want me to send my friends and family a request to join and play, while I’m being robbed or attacked by random players who aren’t on my friends list. But I can only take revenge on my friends and family? Why can’t I take revenge on those who IT SAYS robbed me? Then it lies to you, it will tell you, you have bankrupted someone, but the number shown to you and the other player are vastly different.

I understand it’s hard to develop a game and mistakes can happen. But this is getting ridiculous. The compensation we got for the last bug was pretty poor too. I get better rewards from just playing the game. Also, they had a whole timed event where the game wasn’t even working for part of the time, so I don’t think we all got the most we could out of it. I hope they’re able to make it better cause it’s a fun game, but my lord the issues lately have been ridiculous.",Super buggy recently!
5,2023-06-09 14:57:06,"I never write reviews but I just absolutely adore this game! The gameplay is fun and unique, the pacing is nice and doesn’t allow you to drastically advance overnight, and playing against friends is great! My only feedback would be to ask for more trades per day, as sometimes one trade deal can take all of the available slots! I personally think 10 would be perfect, but that’s just my opinion :) Otherwise can’t recommend this game enough!",Please add more trades per day!

I hope they fix the issues that have caused me to lose money and dice during play due to game crashing or freezing up during events  and when I reopen the app I don’t have my winnings showing up in my game and when I have won dice they didn’t appear at the bottom. This is very frustrating when you are spending money to play and when I win I don’t get my rewards when this happens. Please fix this and give me my winnings owed to me in my account.

3,2023-07-04 05:30:16,"This game is a lot of fun in the beginning. The further along you get into the game, the more frustrating it becomes until it finally becomes not worth playing anymore.   There are stickers you can collect which can be redeemed for additional dice rolls and cash. That is great except for the fact that you will eventually get to a point where you can no longer get the stickers you need to complete sets. You can try to trade stickers with others on Facebook, however, most other players are chasing the same stickers you are.   The further along you go into the game, the more expensive the properties are. The amount you collect from dice rolls does not keep pace with the increase in property prices which makes it more difficult to advance as the game goes on.   As I said, the game is fun in the beginning but the frustration builds as the game goes on until the point that is no longer worth playing.",Fun Until It’s Not Fun
2,2023-06-30 16:02:25,"Although the game is great and entertaining, it asks you to invite friends or make friends for rewards and then it continuously has you attacking them, stealing money in heists over other players…I don’t want to make friends only to beat them down. Then to contact support with a question is not an option as I kept getting “page not found” so I had to gripe here. Also, you are bombarded with quick ads for more rolls or events and it takes time from your cash grab time etc…I’m sure you guys are satisfied with the product but you don’t welcome feedback or even have a true chat option for support, it’s all AI. What gives???","Great game, BUT…"

But, after playing for a few months, one day I opened the app and it kept saying no internet connection. I didn’t know why because I was connected to the internet though. I restarted my phone, I opened and closed the app so many times, and I only got into the app once successfully except none of the buttons were working. I really need to get into the game cause I just won 1.5k dice in the tournament and I need to use it lol. So I really need to know what happened.",Great game
5,2023-11-07 03:03:07,"So I absolutely loved the game but the one problem I keep getting is getting more than one of the same sticker, so these are the solutions: 1.

2,2023-05-23 22:25:29,"When you first open the game you deal with multiple pop up ads, as you play the game there are no less than EIGHT intrusive adds up and down the sides of your screen taking up way too much space, every time you run out of dice naturally you then deal with no less than FOUR bloody ads offering you purchase options.   Listen, the game might have been fantastic if not for the ads. You're greedy and money hungry like most apps, understood. But don't have the blasted ads CONSTANTLY ALL OVER THE SCREEN!!!!

1,2023-04-29 20:43:25,If you a sensitive true vegan like me you will not like this game. They have a rodeo as part of the game and we true vegans know rodeos are animal cruelty. So seeing that reminds me what they do to these innocent horses at the rodeo and it breaks my heart.  No one should say to a true vegan “it’s just a game” because it’s not just a game when IT REMINDS a true sensitive highly empathetic Vegan of the true animal cruelty involved in videos. THEN it hurts my heart and makes me angry for what these idiot ppl do to these animals at rodeos and make me cry for these innocent animals being abused by ignorant stupid selfish humanoids. In other words it triggers the memory of what really goes on in rodeos in turn makes us angry and sad and that’s no way to enjoy a game.  So on that note I’m deleting d app,Not vegan friendly

This game used to be so fun and now it's annoying and I will be deleting it soon.

I’m deleting the game because of this, and I’m sure they’ve dug their own grave if they don’t address this for the thousands of other users that feel shorted by this new album.

This was a great game and I won the whole albums but it basically restart the game and I just have to play the game all over again. But I had 2500 stickers and I earned more. And it’s taking them all for 1 vault. Why are you taking away all my stickers I earned and paid for?? I spent at least $500 on this game!! Shouldn’t I get to keep my stickers?? You glitch sometimes in the game and I can’t even see the dice sometimes. You only let me land on the special spots rarely and you hardly give dices for such expensive properties.

Why is the game taking away more than it’s giving? If you’re going to take the $400k out the bank account give it to the person that did the heist! If they didn’t when that much then only take what they have won. Now all my money is gone and my friend doesn’t have much to show for it.  Oh you no longer have money?

2,2023-11-06 15:31:36,This game is fun but it’s to the point you have to spend money to truly enjoy the game. They don’t give new stickers out as often as they should. I’ve went over a month without a new card. That’s absolutely ridiculous to go that long without any new cards to try to complete albums. The rewards for albums are HORRIBLE. Don’t make it so hard to complete if the dice amount is so low. The reward wheel is pathetic. It should be based off what number your rolling not a flat amount.

They’ve made it nearly impossible to complete the album by adding a gold on each set when each time you open a pack all you receive are duplicates, they have lowered the amount of dice you win for a completed set, raised the price of landmarks to complete each board, now they have the peg and have drastically lowered the amount of pegs you can win by events or tournaments, oh I can go on. I once fully enjoyed this game but they ripped the fun out of it by wanting you to spend money on the game when even if you do, you won’t get far. Disappointed.",Disappointed with the changes
1,2023-09-20 13:31:54,I liked playing monopoly. It was generally on of the better games that I was able to play without spending much if any money.  Recently the dice you earn for completing a sticker pack have been reduced. The odds of winning a good sticker on a wheel spin or in a card pack have been reduced as well. The tournaments are always filled with either a bot or someone who has spent hundreds of dollars so you can never win one. The special events have also given out less rewards.  All of this means that I am no longer able to play without making purchases. And trying to complete all the sticker packs will probably cost someone hundreds of dollars.,Changed things to encourage purchases
4,2023-09-08 17:46:42,"As much as I’d love to leave this game a 5⭐️, I just can’t. There’s tons of bugs especially around the special events they do, customer support is a joke and with the newest album/update, they have definitely made this game a pay-to-play type. It’s extremely addicting especially when you have friends to play with, trade stickers and the events get you all hyped up. It’s a great down time game to play but unless you have money to constantly throw into it to stay competitive in it, it’s pointless.","It’s great, but…"
5,2023-08-30 22:14:20,My cousin had put me on and at first I ignored it but one day I was bored and clicked the link and been hooked since. I put my friends and colleagues onto it and we are all competitive. At first it may seem boring when you barely have friends but once you link your Facebook and phone number and all your friends that already playing automatically is added or once you invite other people by sending your link it’s really fun.,Great Game
3,2023-09-07 14:17:08,"Great concept and it’s a cute game.  However, once the novelty wears out, it’s a fairly mindless game.   I enjoyed spending a few minutes a day, running through the limited number of free rolls offered and seeing the various scenarios, but it got quickly boring and the constant pop ups, soliciting money got old quick. The cookie/baking thing was the last straw for me, however.  Causes the game to freeze up repeatedly and greatly diminished the ability to collect more dice, rendering the game only playable for about 1-2 minutes.   Had to delete the app and find something else.",Briefly amusing
5,2023-08-25 21:11:03,"This is a fun game for any age! I am 66 and love to play. It’s not expensive and there’s no hidden cost. I have friends my age that will not try this innovative game, so I am having fun finding younger players and playing with them. It so much better than just watching TV or doing nothing because it’s so incredibly hot here. Absolutely would recommend this game to everyone. Thank you for this fun and interesting game. Much better than the original board game. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ⭐️ Sincerely,   Cynthia S Eckhardt",Monopoly Go
1,2023-08-28 12:18:26,"The game was going great with friends and family… it is fun! However, the game allows people that are NOT your Friends and Family to steal from you in a bank heist and there is NO WAY to retaliate! That’s crap! If you want to allow strangers to attack and tak 200+ million to a billion then allow for retaliation otherwise the game will be counter productive and make people quit! I have been reading on game blogs monopoly might want to read what some of your loyal gamers are saying! Part 2 I was gifted a card the game conveniently crashed and the “transaction failed” I never got credit in my album for the card and the person that gifted the card no longer had it! That’s crap! Do better! 😔",Very disappointed

5,2023-07-20 15:48:51,"I do like the game and it definitely passes the time. I also like the real life game but at least we’re not up til 2am fighting over properties haha.  I would like if the developers could give you new stickers more often though. Collecting stickers and trading is great; but when you’re trying to get a prize for finishing your cards and you’re only getting the same stuff over and over, it gets frustrating.   Overall it’s a fun game and I’ve been enjoying it!",Fun
4,2023-08-21 12:09:24,"DONT Get Me Wrong I Thank Y’all As. A Creator For Making. A Game We’re We Can all PLay As.

I’ve got a million of the crappy stickers but can’t get the last 7 stickers to save my life. And most of what I need are gold cards that my family has and could trade me BUTTT you can’t trade gold cards for some dumb reason. I get that there has to be some challenge but it shouldn’t be impossible. Also, as you level up and have to pay BILLIONS to finish a board your prize is still 50 measly dice. Like 50 dice is nothing especially when you are leveled up high enough. This game has SOOOOOO much potential. Just do better.",Irritating
4,2023-08-03 12:45:57,"So don’t get me wrong. Game is addicting. But it constantly puts you behind a paywall. It gives you several free rewards and then it gives you a reward you have to buy with real money so you can get to the other free rewards. That’s dirty guys. Also if you run out of rolls then expect at least three pop ups asking you to buy more rolls. However, other than that the game is fun and it does give a bit of free rewards. They just push the “buy more rolls” into your face very hard.",Good game but too many micro transactions
2,2023-07-24 18:11:00,I love this game and regrettably spent money on it. But I would’ve continued if I wasn’t ripped off. I’m very disappointed in Scopely with their customer support services. I tried contacting their in game support multiple times and yet to get a response. They said to give it 2-4 days and it’s pushing a week since my purchase. This would’ve been my favorite game if it took accountability and just give me my purchased items. I’m still waiting on a response or another way to contact someone who isn’t a robot. So if your going to play this game DONT SPEND A DIME. Unless you’re willing to chance not getting your purchase and wasting money.,Missing Purchase
5,2023-07-10 20:35:28,"I have been playing this game so much that I cannot take my eyes off it. One time, I ran out of stickers to trade, so I ended up swapping my house and wife for a set and even my neighbor’s dogs for another set. Talk about a wild trading spree!  I don’t know if I’m the ultimate real estate mogul or just plain crazy, but thanks to Monopoly Go, I now have more sets of stickers than I have friends. Maybe it’s time to rethink my life choices, but hey, at least I’m winning in the virtual world!",Be careful you will get addicted.
5,2023-10-30 01:54:11,The over all game is fun but we should be able to take the cash we make on the game and purchase sticker packs and hope we get something different in them no reason to keep getting duplicates of same cards over and over again and for as dice the higher you go on the board the more dice you should receive and we should be able to trade gold cards as well,Need better ways to trade and get stickers and dice
4,2023-06-25 18:38:50,It’s definitely a fun game especially being able to play with your friends or people period. The sticker trading is also pretty cool too in order to complete albums for large rewards. My only issue for real is that after a while you ONLY GET NOTHING BUT DUPLICATE STICKERS and I think there should be a limit on how many duplicate stickers you’re given. & everyone seems to be looking for the same stickers. The only time you really get new ones is if you buy them and it’s only so many times one is willing to buy.,Monopoly
1,2023-06-01 23:53:10,"This is such a fun game that I really enjoyed, an interactive play style that was annoying as you were pressured to buy something constantly. The reason I’m leaving one star though is because of the most recent event, love is love. A celebration of gay culture that promotes perversity and that represents few people but is promoted everywhere. Promoting gay love on a child’s game is sick and you should be ashamed because I know you don’t promote heterosexuality or Christian values to make it fair. I will not play this game again and will start standing against this brain washing agenda that is ruining our nation.  Shame on you game developers, I hope more people begin standing against it like that have recently with Budweiser, your agenda is ruining innocent fun.",Sad to see
4,2023-05-30 09:36:11,"This is truly one of the best (& most addictive) games I’ve downloaded and actually played for more than a day without deleting!  I am not in FB so I cannot connect with “friends” and I like that you can add random friends who play this game; HOWEVER, if you have a friend listed I do not like the fact that they appear in your Bank Heist and you cannot change/switch to a random opponent as you have done so with Shutdown. This is a pet peeve that I hope you will change. (Friends do not steal from Friends… at least I don’t). Lol",Great Game BUT…
4,2023-05-04 17:11:14,"Love it it’s super addicting the only complaints I have are, dice are so far apart, you can’t give friends rolls, some stickers are harder to get, can’t trade gold cards which is more of a disadvantage than a help, and the “official Facebook group” has people that are willing to trick you saying they will trade you but end up just taking your sticker, deleting the post and blocking you, thus taking advantage of other honest players that actually trade, with no repercussion. Overall I enjoy every other aspect of the game.",Only Listing Cons to a great addicting game.
1,2023-11-07 17:03:07,"The game is no doubt addicting.  I could spend hours on it if given the chance. However, the game feels so ungodly rigged. I caved and spent $99 for the 3k dice plus 15k.. and have been sparingly using the dice to at least not go for it all in one round. Now, I’m barely landing on the railroad/winning anything. It’s like the game wants me to plow through the dice so I spend more money!!! Not to mention the price of things is RIDICULOUS. $10 for 180 dice?!?! WHAT CAN YOU REALLY EVEN DO WITH 180 dice?!? The prices need to change, and the game needs to not be set up for me to plow through the dice. Once these dice are up I’ll be deleting the game until changes have been made. It’s not even fun any more, it’s simply FRUSTRATING!",Feels Rigged
4,2023-11-03 22:32:34,This is a fun game to play. Some days it’ll let you really win big and advance into the game a few levels. Lately it has been short on giving out the rolls and the little safe’s you can get skimp on the rolls some times. We wait hours or a whole day just to receive 20 rolls or 30 rolls. There should be more mini games where you can win higher amount of rolls especially because they go so fast. Also there should be more partner type games with the big prizes. Those are fun too.,Fun game
2,2023-11-01 16:14:17,"The game gives you contests to try and finish within a certain amount of time. It also gives you buffs as rewards that last a limited amount of time. But with the amount of error messages I get causing game to restart it’s ridiculous. Can’t progress in contests, lose your buffs because the timer keeps going. Every other time I land on something to trigger an event, like a wheel spin or railroad it crashes out and makes me re-roll from 2 turns back. Funnily enough, I’d say 3 out of 4 of those re-rolls wind up landing in same spots causing it to crash again and again. Fix your game.",Crashing over and over
3,2023-10-30 06:07:07,"This game is based strictly for monetization, you can’t get any new stickers or dice unless you’re willing to spend mone. The spooky car event was raised by a total of 40,000, which makes it impossible to finish all of them. They hardly give you any steering wheels for your board and on any of the events going on. The dice cap should be more then 80 and should regenerate faster than 10 hours.. And you should get more than just 50 dice for completing the boards. This game is just getting harder and harder to play for the people that don’t want to spend money on it..",Game is a scam

People trying to sell stickers for money.  People scamming out of stickers, and customer support does nothing.  Get it together or you’re going to end up losing a lot of players.",Super glitchy
4,2023-10-21 16:19:21,"I do love this game, it’s simple and has lots of side things that change daily to weekly. The at being said there are a few annoying things about it.   Every single time you open the game you have to click through all the buy packages and again every time you run out of dice. Trust me we know you can buy more dice and packages, please stop making us go through it.   The closer you get to bigger prizes the less you land on the squares that allow you to level up. It’s extremely frustrating and obviously a tactic to get you to buy more dice.   Stickers- as others have mentioned stop with so many doubles. There is really only 2 ways to get higher stickers- community chest and spinning the wheel. Both of which are next to impossible to achieve. Maybe have an event where sticker packs are upgraded to the next star",Fun and easy
2,2023-10-08 22:43:48,Be careful because this company will take money out of your account for purchases that u don’t even make in this game constantly! It’s happened to me and several others I know several times for several hindered dollars total! Also they won’t give the stickers needed to complete the album they have and only some cards are able to be traded! Even whenever u can trade them it’s hard to get the ones u can’t trade to get! There’s constantly bugs and it doesn’t give rewards you are supposed to get or take u to the number of spaces that are showing on the dice. This game is a constant rip off!,Been scammed!
3,2023-09-29 17:51:38,"I love this game it’s super fun for passing time, they make it hard to complete the sets you can trade only five times a day. I wish they would let you trade the gold cards the game is supposed to be fun and once you have all the stickers but can’t get a gold card you need it’s harder cause then you don’t have dice and to get more dice you have to finish a set or buy dice in the shop. You get tons of duplicate stickers but hardly ever get one you actually need. You can get 8 dice an hour which isn’t anything in my opinion it won’t get you far at all.",Could be better.
2,2023-09-27 04:50:17,"They make it way to difficult to accumulate dice.  It’s also impossible to fill your album unless you spend a ton of money.  4 and 5 star gold stickers are 1 in a million.  It’s also a absolute joke they only give you 50 dice when you complete a full landmark build.  I’m on landmark 150 and getting 50 dice literally does absolutely nothing for you.  Customer service is a joke, I got a sticker that would have completed my album but never received it.  That sticker would have given me 800 dice and like a couple hundred million.  I complained and 2 weeks later received no sticker but 30 free dice and 10 million..",Pay to play

I even sent screenshots of game glitching!,I would give 5⭐️s but the game is still glitching
5,2023-07-17 22:03:28,So me personally I love the game monopoly so when I saw this game I’m like download right now! When I got the game I immediately fell in love with it I love how it challenges you and makes the money more expensive as you go because that will really get my distracted and make me enjoy my self. And I love how you can bank rupt people and steal there money I always get so happy when I get the bank rupt cause I win a lot of money so this is probably my fav game so far keep up that good work,I love this game
1,2023-09-02 03:42:33,"At first this game was so fun. I was in a little group where you can trade stickers and collect them and connect with people . The game itself is no worth it. They became money hungry in this new album where the prizes for dice is lower than the old album. Also, because I have bought couple times, the price for me to buy dice or stickers became so expensive. In the new album, every set requires you to collect a gold sticker which is not tradeable. Basically if you don’t spend money, this game is impossible to win. I tried contacting their customer service and it takes forever to contact them in general. It’s so disappointing. They need to do better",Honestly it’s no longer worth it

I had actually technically issues and people who didn't got 200 dice and a pink pack. Tried connecting them but can’t even get ahold of them and nobody responds. It should be far and send out the same rewards not different people get different things. Also they make it hard to get the gold cards.

Same with the stickers I get a new one every blue moon but other than that just a bunch of repeats and I play daily but honestly if I don’t complete this event and sticker collection I’m probably just going to give up and delete the game it’s pointless to play if I’m never actually completing the sticker collections or partner events 🤦🏼‍♀️,Game won’t load

2,2023-07-31 23:36:51,I rate monopoly go a two off the simple fact that we never get enough rolls to really be able to enjoy the game. In the packs that they give they never give the cards that you need. When you do get a lot of dice at once they constantly make you land on income tax where they takes funds from your monopoly account. Then they don’t have a block button some people will literally hit your board back to back and it’s no way to stop it. I also feel that 50 dice when upgrading to next level is definitely not enough for a game like this.,I actually liked the game it’s just needs more updates maybe
2,2023-07-22 14:48:56,I first saw monopoly go I got excited but didn’t download it at first. I kept seeing ads so I finally downloaded it and I thought it was going to be like the actual board game where you join a game with about four other people and you all get to choose a piece and play like the normal board game. personally I’m not a big fan it gets boring easily I love the original board game better that’s just on my opinion. but if it was more like the actual board game I think I might actually keep the game. but playing the game by yourself isn’t monopoly it’s better when you can actually play with other people.,Not really what I was expecting
5,2023-06-10 17:19:42,"Why is it that I had nearly 400 stars in stickers, but with the last update features new stickers, I lost all of those old ones. Now I look to see how many stars I have with stickers and it says 22 but I counted 99 altogether. Not too sure what’s going on with that but I think that when you save up the stars to unlock things, you shouldn’t have to worry about losing them or them not being added up properly.",A bit disappointed
1,2023-07-17 01:16:42,I tried out this game and after a couple weeks I don’t like it. It becomes very repetitive and boring.

I have to give them all the information to my account including how much Monopoly money do I have and how much if any money did I spend in the game smh ridiculous I want my profile to be deleted it should never have been this difficult to delete your profile!

4,2023-06-26 05:42:11,This game is so fun and it’s great. I like how it’s one of those very few games that don’t bombard you with ads. It is a very good night game to play and is all around enjoyable to play if you have a few minutes on your hands that you need to burn. The only thing I don’t like about this game is how if you run out of dice rolls you can only get more dice rolls by waiting for the count down or buying them. That is my only complaint but otherwise it’s great and I really do recommend this game to anyone who wants a good time waster game.,It’s super fun
3,2023-05-28 18:18:27,"One of my pet peeves is having to tap through a large number of offers and invite your friends screens to get to gameplay. This game, unfortunately, takes that to the next level by adding a tap through screen for every single reward. Today I had 8 screens to tap through before I could play. I wish the developers would consolidate these screens, especially since you WILL see them again when they interrupt your playing.   That being said, gameplay is a lot of fun and graphics are great!  Boards are very creative.",Too many tap throughs

The guaranteed card that was worked so hard to finish wasn't received.  There is no point contacting customer service.  The last time I didn't receive a reward. I contacted customer service. They never got back to me. I sent a picture and took a screen recording.  Started  screen recording for proof if missing rewards. What is the point. Customer is non existent!,Missing gold sticker
4,2023-10-24 01:54:34,"Really enjoyed playing the game at the beginning but now it seems like once you hit a certain amount of cards all they do it keep repeating them over and over and you never get the gold cards that you need. Also, you only get a certain amount of dice per hour like seriously its like they want you to spend money in buying what they have to offer. I wish they would really improve in those to aspects that. Better cards and more rolls",Prizes are hard to get
2,2023-10-23 22:29:04,"A couple weeks ago I could go hours without running out of rolls, but recently I can only play once a day. It seems the game goes out of its way to give you the worse possible outcome the higher on the leaderboards you get. it’s also pay to win, i could be #1 on the leaderboard for a competition with 20 minutes to go but if i leave and come back, I’ll suddenly be 25th & receive barely any rewards. Community chest is absolutely useless, I never get more than 2-3 people before it stops. The money I get from it is nothing. Stickers are absolutely rigged. I maybe get a new one once a week.",Used to be fun
1,2023-10-20 17:01:40,"You act like giving new cards or giving more dice is like giving actual real life money away. When I first started playing this game it was fun, but now it feels like a chore, I haven’t gotten a new card in over a month, I can never get over 200 dice so it makes it really hard to progress. If you guys want to really improve the game you should listen to the feedback everyone is giving, there’s no reason why nobody is getting new stickers and all we get is duplicates , there’s no reason we should have to wait a full 8 hours just to have 80 dice, this game could be fun again if you guys would just listen to the feedback and make the changes.",Just listen
2,2023-10-07 21:04:32,This game is highly addictive. I would have gave it 5 stars however it’s been disappointing lately.  You can only get 80 dice which you will find is not even enough to keep your shields up.  They should double that.  Every time there’s a new partner event there a convenient glitch that needs to be updated and you lose out on so many dice and rewards towards your progression.  Finally after complaining you are sent a generic response from customer service promising a gift to your account in which they never send and you are stuck with the response over and over.,Really use to love this game
2,2023-09-29 13:53:36,"This game started off great. It was lots of fun and entertaining. Now that the new board (Epic Myths)is well under way, it has proven to be quite disappointing. It’s impossible to get gold stickers to complete sets and for the last two weeks I haven’t received ANY new stickers. It appears the only way to have any success in this game is to spend a lot of your own real money or be a hacker (and believe me there’s LOTS of them out there) and make the game miserable for everyone else. I’m ready to delete the game, it’s frustrating an no longer a fun get away from regular life stress. On to find something else.",Went from fun to disappointing
3,2023-09-23 21:10:40,"My favorite game of all time. But since I’ve started this game I’m getting more disappointing by the day. Dice’s are slow to reload, and the higher you are in the game the less shields you receive on the broad. I haven’t gotten a new sticker card since the new sticker game started. There has to be a way for this game to get better, from the time frame of each mini games, dice reload, and how we get new stickers. I’m not going to keep spending money to get deals and the stickers are not even new they are all duplicates. I’m very disappointed……",Starting to hate this game
1,2023-09-22 17:25:01,"APPLE WHY DOES THIS NOT SHOW UP IN THE REVIEWS? COMPLICIT MUCH???? Game Doesn’t pay you and steals at every turn. I can’t heist someone outside my friends but I was heisted 2xs for 700m by strangers in the middle of the night and every morning I have no blockers left. Constantly avoiding the tiles you need and if you do manage to get extra rolls.. you only get them 50% of the time. Add buildings and it takes your money but doesn’t credit the build so you pay twice for 1 house. Everyone loves this game and I see why, but the greed has just ruined it. BTW.. I’m at level 2045 and map #58, so I’m not new and I’ve def watched it go to pot… Scopely is apparently a GOD awful company should be banned from all future gaming on Apple",GREED and Glitches

In fact, I don’t think I’ve experienced one only one thing. You can’t friend people you have the most Facebook or contacts in one of the web, but I can’t friend people because what’s my friends have like androids or something? Yeah by the way, here’s my crush lol JK not happening.",I love it
3,2023-09-21 01:05:18,The game is amazing. But i do believe the game needs a new ui system for the stickers mainly. When the new sticker sets came out i couldnt believe that i collecting doubles of the stickers of ones i already had when i have 21 other sets to complete. As well as when you first log into the game its giving ad after ad for in game purchases which is kind of annoying. It seems the game wants/needs you to spend real money to feel rewarded. Once these issues get fixed i would love to change the rating but for now it is what is.,Amazing game but needs a new AI
2,2023-09-20 05:43:43,This game is fun in the sense it’s just addicting to go around the board. But I mean really… There is no objective really in the game. You get dice you roll dice and you upgrade the board and get stickers. That’s literally all. You wait 8 hours to get like what 80 rolls? And then after you go through them you get 500 different pop up screens asking you to spend a RIDICULOUS amount of money on dice rolls that might last maybe an hour depending how much you spend. Like I mean come on? This game is so garbage and is clearly a money grab that is working. Please don’t spend your money on this game.,Not sure where the 5star reviews are coming from.
1,2023-09-15 17:02:23,"This game could be a lot of fun, but it isn’t. When you can’t get what you need, it’s merely frustrating. We have a large group, and none of us can get the golds we need. If we do get golds( which you must have to finish a section of the game and move up), it’s a duplicate ( which you can do nothing with). They encourage us to form groups of “friends “ and trade stickers. You can’t very well trade when you are all looking for the same stuff. It is addicting and has the potential to be a great game, if only the game makers would be a little more generous. I play these games to relax. Life is frustrating enough. I don’t need anything else to set my nerves on edge.",If you are looking for frustration
3,2023-09-14 00:18:31,"I do love playing this game! But you get the same stickers all the time. You have have to buy stickers dice and cash. (This game is hard when you DON’T want to pay for cash,dice,and stickers). And it takes 1 hour to get your dice. It would be nice to get dice instead of big sum of cash, all the time. And the gold stickers when you have multiples, you should be able to trade the gold stickers. You do have trade groups but EVERYONE wants to hold on to them. You can trade the stickers in you get the same stickers that you already have 😞.","Love playing but, There is a catch"
3,2023-09-12 11:54:43,"At first this game was really fun, but now that I’m at a hire level, I still only receive 50 dice for completing a board. At this point it takes billions of dollars to complete. The game still only gives 8 dice an hour up to 80 then it stops. The rewards don’t match higher levels. Why am I still getting the same dice rewards as in the beginning. You can’t trade gold stickers but yet they give you duplicates…why? I have so many duplicates of stickers and only receive a new one every now and then. They need to up the rewards",Rewards don’t match the level
5,2023-08-03 22:40:28,"I absolutely love this game , it’s great to play especially when you’re bored and need something  to pass the time, only thing is the stickers it shouldn’t be so difficult to complete the different albums and I think they need to give more rolls instead of just the amount they give on the daily other then that I absolutely enjoy trying to take down friends landmarks and doing heist on their banks in the game . Lol",Love ! But could use some things
2,2023-09-01 15:38:03,"I got my friends and family into this game and we’ve all been addicted to playing, but after the new album release yesterday 08/31, they’ve changed many things. Good for the developers, bad for the consumers.   It’s much more difficult to get good sticker packs without spending actual money, and the rewards for completing the sticker albums drastically decreased unfortunately.   For example, the most difficult album in the new release is 1600 rolls but the old one used to be 3k+… that’s a HUGE difference. The pink vault stars required also went up from 1500 stars to 2500 stars.   To top things off, they make you have one gold every set now, instead of having 3-4 golds required in the more difficult sets. It seems good at first, but with the odds of getting a gold card without spending money, you might not be able to finish even the first 5 sets! I hope they update or change this for the better because all in all, this game is really fun!",It used to be GREAT.
3,2023-08-23 01:31:17,The only problem I have with this game is that they make it impossible to win stickers.  You can’t trade Gold cards ever.  I literally need 12 cards to finish with only eight days left.  Sticker packs just keep adding to my collection of useless cards.  I appreciate a challenge but this is ridiculous.  Dice Dreams was another game that made it impossible.  Pretty much stopped playing it because of Monopoly Go.  Once another game comes along I’ll probably grow tired of playing this too.    The creators need to do something different.,Fun and addicting but there are problems …
2,2023-08-07 14:59:08,The whole sticker situation is just crazy! They give you the SAME stickers over and over with only a few rolls after hours of waiting knowing rolls go by quick! I haven’t had any new stickers in about a month which is one of the main points of the game. You can’t trade the specific cards you need with people which is crazy! This game is set up to where nobody is going to win big. Don’t get me wrong it was addicting and super fun in the beginning but once you get more ahead of the game and start realizing the game gives you less and less of that you need it gets pretty irritating.,Fun but gets annoying
2,2023-08-03 23:12:38,"Unable to make purchases in the game. When I type in my card number, it will randomly change a number in it, repeatedly.

The customer support tutorial is telling me to contact my devices customer support but my device works fine when I use my card for anything else.

Unable to make purchases.
5,2023-07-24 19:21:53,"It’s a really fun game to play also very addicting 😂 all you want to do is get more rolls to get all the cards you need. Just wish we had more trades, five is not enough also really wish as you climb the map the rolls would be some higher as well as the dollar amounts. Fifty rolls is just not enough. And having to wait an hour is a bit much. But other than that if you enjoyed playing regular board monopoly you will utterly love this version. It is phenomenal.",Great Game

1,2023-11-08 14:22:09,"The game does not give enough dice to even play. If you’re just starting out, it’s really fun. I’m on board 242 and it costs $14 BILLION to update to a new board. Takes thousands of dice and days to accumulate. Then you get your new board and they reward you with 50 dice which is about 5 rolls. The only way to get 5 star packs is to get #1 in tournaments, the only way to get #1 in anything is to buy dice. The price to buy dice is OUTRAGEOUS. If I’m spending $10 on dice, it should give 5,000 dice not 95. This game is only fun when you have thousands of dice to roll and actually win new stickers or even stand a chance in tournaments.

I can never roll doubles when I’m in jail, but as soon as i get out… Boom doubles. Yet again it’s a great game and I play it daily but that’s just my opinion.  P.S. Donating dice would be cool too.",I mean its ight

I would be content with challenging but obtainable. However, each tournament and event becomes more and more stacked against players almost to the point of blatant hostility. I want to love this game, it was a favorite as a child. But more and more players are becoming disenchanted, frustrated, and giving up.

3,2023-10-26 20:18:26,"I seriously love the concept of this game and it is very fun and addictive to play. However, I have spent well over $100 (which I usually NEVER do) on the packs they offer. What makes me so mad is that I can spend $25 on a pack… and still not get a new sticker that I need. Just the same old repeats. You would think when you spend $25 on a pack, which I’ve done several times now… they would actually give you something for that. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice…. I’ve learned my lesson. No more money spent. I regret it every single time",Addictive and fun…. But….
3,2023-10-21 18:05:32,"As with other games it’s fun but, it’s a scam, I must admit I was one of the fools that spent money on the game and for what you get for the price is not worth it, not to mention I just saw where you can trade golden stickers but it picks it for you and guess what it picks the golden stickers that you only have one of, it certainly does not let me trade the stickers which I actually have multiples of- go figure. I would like to know if anyone actually completes the set without spending a substantial amount of money. So far the only game that I have spent money on and makes it worthwhile is Homescapes","Fun, But"
5,2023-09-28 15:59:25,This game is super fun aside from the fact that unless you complete the board or something similar the amount of dice that are given are minuscule… 5 an hour? Come on.  Also bummed because I’ve been trying to access the game all morning and there’s some bug or issues not allowing it to load. I was 2nd in a tournament and not sure where I’ll be now or if other tournaments will still be going since they’re timed…,Fix bugs?!

But as with all games, I hate the fact that to get anywhere after a certain level you have to pay inordinate amounts of money to still get minimal dice. It’s not fun after that. It’s not as if you don’t know nobody can get anywhere on 70-80 dice after a point. So I’m stuck sitting on my 1500ish right now because it’s not like I can complete anything to get more dice with just 1500 dice either. Perhaps allowing us to purchase dice with in game money?

Still can’t trade gold cards when I’ve already received the same 1 ⭐️card since I’ve started the new album. Okay now secondly the shields are stupid how is that going to help us win and complete the album ?!? Understand you get rewards for collecting like the tokens but it has no purpose of monopoly!!!

There are several things that should upgrade as you advance in the game.

If chose to play, play for fun, don’t spend hard earned money on the game, the company does not value you your money or you.","Game Play is Intriguing, Scopely Customer Service Dreadful"
3,2023-11-02 21:30:48,"Approximately a month or so ago I was playing this game,  had many friends , many levels and it froze up on me mid play . I exited the game , turned my phone off & back on & tried every which way to get it to restart and it wouldn’t . I was many levels into the game and a multi billionaire . I finally decided to delete it . Several weeks later got a game request from my son to play the game so I thought I would reload it and it would take me back to my former level , nope had to start at ground zero . Pretty sad about it .",Game freeze up
2,2023-11-02 19:06:43,"It started off fun. But once you keep getting the same stickers, and not being able to complete sets, and the sponsored facebook groups that offer trades aren’t helpful or asking for unreasonable conditions to send said cards or just being scammed it’s awful!!  Partner events are okay but once you get saddled with a partner that doesn’t contribute anything without the option of removing them to find a better partner you lose interest especially when you are focused on trying to complete the event.  Sticker vaults aren’t worth anything! I traded 2500 stars and just got duplicate stickers no gold, nothing new!!",Not fun
2,2023-10-30 14:34:23,I’ve been playing the last 2 seasons everyday and it feels like since I stopped spending money my rng has been complete trash. The last 2 co op missions I’ve spent over 3k wheels only to never spin anything above a x5. My community chest hasn’t been opened in weeks because I get 2 people and that’s it. My gf on the other hand doesn’t play as much maybe 3-4 times a week and she is further than me on almost all events. I hate feeling like I need to spend money to keep up with free players or that my “luck/rng” has been throttled because I refuse to spend more money.,Game feels like it punishes everyday play unless you pay $
1,2023-10-25 02:51:44,"I've been playing Monopoly Go and overall, the game has its merits. However, I've noticed a particular tactic in the in-app purchase section that is concerning. When attempting to buy more coins, a countdown timer pops up, suggesting a limited-time offer. But when the timer reaches zero, it just freezes, leading to confusion. Closing and reopening the shop starts the timer again, with the same result. This creates a false sense of urgency and feels like a strategy to push users into impulsive purchases. It's essential for apps to be transparent and fair in their approach to in-app purchases. I hope the developers address this issue for a better user experience.",Psychological Tactics Everywhere
1,2023-09-26 13:19:07,It seems that with community chest it cheats to make sure you never get the big prize the fact they give you so many good cards but won’t allow you to trade also how you invite people and don’t get the reward and the fact that they put a cap on dice for how many people you can invite is crazy they also keep raising the price each album not only that but making it 10 times harder to even get a new card much less one you actually need and let’s not get me started on events or the cheating Peggy robot this game needs to seriously be fixed a game is supposed to be stress free and fun this Is probably about the most stressful game I’ve ever played!!!!,Cheating game
5,2023-09-20 22:20:33,I think after while we shouldn’t be able to get the same cards and the game should generate more new cards. I 6 extras of one card. Fun game can’t stop playing. But I wish there were a little more prizes. And more tournaments like building the car and cake. And when we’re best certain boards like 100+ we should receive more than 50 dice since it’s costing and taking more work (dice) to level up.,Good game just give better prizes
3,2023-09-21 03:58:32,It started off so good. I was enjoying the continuous playing and casual gaming. It felt balanced and competitive with spending feeling entirely optional if you wanted an edge but not necessary to enjoy. Now? Now you HAVE to spend money to enjoy the game or be competitive. Now it’s just a game with an extensive timer and no continuous play anymore. I don’t know what they changed but this disappoints me. A three because I still like the game but if it doesn’t change back to what it was I’ll be deleting this app and moving on to other games. So sad.,This used to be fun. Why did it change?
5,2023-08-15 14:53:38,"I don’t usually leave a review but MonopolyGO is awesome! I grew always wanting to play the board game monopoly with friends and family and no one wanted to play. They thought it was either boring, too long to play or to hard cause of having to count money and pay rent, etc… but MonopolyGO is something else. Of course it won’t stop me from still playing the different version board games they created! But I love this game/app!!!",Better than the board game!
1,2023-09-19 19:48:35,I like the game but I think I speak for many people when I say that the way you give dice isn’t fair and will make you loose players I’m on a high level and it’s taking me 75 billion dollars to upgrade one board but I only get 50 dice every time yes the money increase but that’s a drop in the ocean if you don’t have dice to play this aspect of the game will make you lose players forcing them to spend money on the game when they are just trying to have fun and also the stickers we shouldn’t be getting all the same card even when we open good packs and  this time around the rewards for finishing a set are to low and also make me want to delete the game,More dice!!!!!!!
4,2023-09-06 08:07:06,"Love the game and the events are fun to participate in.  I do wish there was a trade option in the stickers to where both parties have to accept the trade and the game will wait until both cards are sent to give it to players. That way people wouldn’t get scammed out of stickers.   Or the partner events, I wish you could cancel a  partner if they aren’t participating/contributing at all to make it fair.  Other than that I think it’s a fun game to play when you want to pass time or when you get bored.",Love it but..
2,2023-08-28 13:51:38,"The game is fun and all but the glitches are ridiculous and caused me to lose money. I purchased one of the packs they offered and I got the notification that my payment was successful. However, before I could get the reward it said error and then proceeded to completely restart the app. And when it came back up it said I never bought it. I then got a notification from my bank that the purchase was made. I have submitted my complaint via chat option in the app, email, and now here. It has been 3 days since this occurred and nothing has been done about it. Do better!",Game glitches
1,2023-08-28 13:25:52,"i can’t even enjoy the game properly due to the amount of pop ups INSIDE the application. after you run out of dice to roll, 4 - 5 ads to purchase more rolls will pop up!! it’s absolutely overstimulating and annoying. not to mention the app will HARASS you if you leave without shields or if you still have dice to roll. it’s honestly getting to the point where i want to delete the app. the game itself has so many glitches it needs to be fixed. the game doesn’t even give you enough dice to play with and you can’t do much besides two things when you land on a railroad. gets boring quick. i would give 0 stars due to the amount of ADS!!",TOO MANY ADS & NOTIFICATIONS
2,2023-08-27 14:04:45,With 4 days left on the album Im down to my last gold card for three weeks now.  I have open several pink packs and you keep giving me  duplicates from other gold that I already have.  how is that fair?!  8 dice per hour is a joke!!! Im on board 172 and I keep receiving the same rewards meaning the same 50 dice as If I were on board 10.  And the offers are not the same for everyone!!! Some people had guaranteed sticker for $20 but my offer were for $100 are you serious right now?!  The game was super fun and I brought my whole family to play but now is just frustrating and unfair.,"Same rewards, unfair"
3,2023-08-27 13:43:43,The game is fun. But. Y’all allow tooooo many duplicates of low level cards. I have multiple gold dupes I can’t do anything with. Pink packs don’t give any new cards. People have completed multiple rounds and most of us can’t even complete it the first time. I’ve spent actual money and still not gotten anything worthwhile. Smh. Community chest is rigged. I’ve only gotten the purple pack twice. And I’ve been playing daily for like 2.5 months. and why am I in jail almost EVERY time I make it around the board. Yall need to fix this. Very much considering deleting the game..,Too many dupes
4,2023-08-27 00:17:08,"Absolutely love this game! I do however have some feedback from playing for the past 3 weeks or so. I joined the Facebook group to trade cards with, but a lot of people are getting ripped off unfortunately. I’m hoping they will install a safer way to trade like the online Pokemon card game. I also think it would be cool for other ways to get cards since a selected amount are locked from trading and I’ve played non stop with so many cards still missing.","Love, but hope they can add more adjustments"
5,2023-07-25 18:54:09,If you are a monopoly fan this game is for you! I love Monopoly and I found this game it’s so Beautiful and it really helps imagination. It’s also really relaxing. There is no ads. And the game is in app purchase but when you download the game it is free and it does not even cost a Single drop. I am in love with the game. And I only even had it for a few days. I am currently on Paris. And I love that you can have a shield To protect your place. It is so addicting and simple at the same time!,In love
1,2023-07-28 15:58:20,Horrible. They have you collect stickers to complete albums. To set sticker you Roll the dice and earn sticker packs along the way in the many challenges. The stickers have different values 1 to 5 stars. They also add several gold stickers. You can trade /share up to 5 stickers a day but gold are non tradable. There are several type of sticker packs. The pick ones guarantee a 5 star. Well I have needed 1 gold star sticker for weeks to complete the whole album and have opened many of these pink packs and needless to say I am still waiting. The game is stingy and even if you buy the in game packages you still do not get what you need. Very frustrating and makes for no fun.,Sticker album
5,2023-11-01 16:05:21,"First time playing this game. Even though I enjoy it, I’m constantly getting errors when I finish building. Once it builds the game crashes & I get an error & it restarts the building process which I have to do it all over. This game has crashed on me over 10 times in a matter of 5 minutes. Even though it’s a cool game I gotta give it a low rating.  If there’s a bug, I hope the devs will fix the issue.",Constant error/crash
1,2023-06-12 13:34:07,"Like most free to play games it starts off well. But after a day the wheels fall off. When you load the game you’ll get 3-4 pop ups asking you to spend money. Are you down to the last roll? Hey here’s 3 more pop ups. And this happens every time.   The game has constant dopamine rushes with bright colors, collectibles, and shiny things but there is no “game” here. You press the GO button until the game asks you for more money. Even Gacha games have a story or SOMETHING to distract you from the fact that it’s a blatant cash grab. No such luck here.

4,2023-05-29 13:25:27,"Super fun game. I always loved monopoly when I was kid, and this is even better than the original. The only thing I say would be nicer is if they made finding friends and trading cards easier within the app vs having to searching people on a Facebook group and manually adding them yourself. Would also be cool if you could see your friends albums too so if you wanted to give them one as a gift you would know what they need right away. Just a thought.",Like a blast from the past but cooler
2,2023-11-06 15:42:43,"I really like playing the game but lately I notice that it takes a lot of money, and dice rolls to finish a board. Then when you advance it only gives you 50 dice to start the next board. I think if you finish a board, the next level should come with an increase in dice and it should go up every time.  It’s also way too expensive to buy dice and stickers bundles because they are not worth it. They give you the same stickers all the time.  Also, there have been times where I finish a album and I never received my prize. I submitted a complaint and no one ever responded.",Too expensive
5,2023-10-31 20:09:15,"I’ve been playing for a few months now and I really enjoy playing with my friends. just recently I was able to build all of my cars on the spooky car challenge, because I finish early I have all of these wheels leftover.

I do wish there were some improvements on the adding friends feature in this game because it’s kind weird, but overall very fun game and I always recommend it to people!",I don’t normally like games but….
1,2023-10-30 15:39:58,I really think monopoly can do better with giving away more gold stickers no one can compete there sets because we can’t get them and where not getting a lot of dice anymore whenever we do compete them. I don’t understand like everyone loves playing this game but it looks like you would try to keep your players happy I know a lot of your players are wanting to delete the game especially myself if you don’t make some changes. Give people more dice and make it easier for people to get these gold stickers and why give us duplicate of the gold stickers if we can’t even trade them that makes no sense. MAKE CHANGES!!!!!!!!!!,Make some changes monopoly!!
3,2023-10-18 12:17:01,So love playing the game but the game has changed in the 5 months I’ve played. The cost of the offer use to be set at a fair price. Not all prizes are collected. When landing on the chance and you get a a move to railroad I don’t get the tokens or (credit) from when I land on chance. Another example you will allow rolls to run out when close to getting large number dice or not able to land on parking to collect the prize in the parking. When purchasing the offer there should be a guarantee that we could get a new card.,Love the game but…..
5,2023-08-31 12:04:36,So recently I had issues with my phone and everything got erased so I had to start completely over. I lost all my stickers and boards but that’s not a big issue to me. What is a big issue is that the cost of building my boards now have increased tremendously. Like I’m not talking the 15th or something board I mean the 2nd and 3rd boards. I love the game I’m just confused as to why once I started over the price to build has increased,Starting over
1,2023-10-06 03:45:27,The old card decks where A lot of fun they were doable but now you don’t get cards as often especially higher cards and with the tournaments they used to be sooo much fun and manageable it was simpler to collect dice and complete your cakes or toy box’s but now you can’t even get dice every one at work would play on break and had so much fun trading cards even my whole family played but now because you don’t get prizes or rewards what’s the point so many of my friends rage quit this game because it’s not even worth the time or money to buy the dice you won’t get the rewards anyway even if you do. Sad because I was obsessed with this game.,This game used to be so much fun.
2,2023-10-06 01:30:22,"Game is 100% all about wanting money, you can’t even start the game without getting 4-5 adds begging for money. The cake building with a partner and now the toy making is 100% rigged you always get low numbers. If the spinner lands on a high number but almost reaches a low number it goes to the low number but if you land on a low number almost reaching a higher number it bounces back.

1,2023-09-29 06:21:23,i got this game maybe 2 months ago and played it very heavily. it’s fun but i also paid and put in A LOT of money into this game. I recently got a new iphone and had all my data transferred to my new phone. all it her apps were fine except for this one. even though i log in with my apple id and facebook my old game data did not tran and it had me start all over again. u lie other games there’s also no “restore purchases” option. so i’m hundreds of dollars out. all my gameplay is gone. and they’re not even responding to my help requests…. might be a fun game but do not pay for anything they’ll totally rip you off at the end,Do not pay for anything!!

The boys that are out into the tournaments are ridiculous I should not be wasting so much dice for first when I finish all the prizes and I’m still in 9th place cause the boys have over 100,000 points. We should get more dice on the higher up boards. I’m on board 300 and something and still get a measly 50 dice. 5 star gold packs should be put into the main events too so we have a better chance of getting them since y’all got these crazy bots in the tournaments.

1,2023-09-27 16:22:37,This album is so hard & I’ve spent about 1k of actual money with the proof to prove it & don’t get anywhere. The prizes that are worth anything are hard to get. The dice takes forever & doesn’t help at all. Tokens are extremely hard to get. Without trading stickers with friends this game would be impossible. Just not fun anymore. The golds are nowhere in site. Granted we still have two months to complete but when does it get easier?! Especially the higher you go up. Bot’s definitely is playing the game with us because ain’t no way you can start a tournament & less than 1 min it’s up to 90k points to reach. Just wouldn’t recommend.,Just not worth it

Now with the second album I feel this game is SUPER RIGGED honestly feel like they’re just out to get money now and make everyone spend money on the game and even spending money on the game they still give you nothing you need. This time around I’m not even having the fun I use to have for the game starting to see myself slowly stop playing it. Wish they’d make it fun again and not just have them look forward to the pay out of the game.",Honest review
4,2023-09-20 23:49:35,"I absolutely love this game. The only thing that I don’t like is we need dice to play can’t play without it.

2,2023-09-20 15:01:15,"The positive here is the visuals are well executed and fun to watch.  However, MonopolyGO does not qualify as a “game” at all.  There is no strategy, no thought necessary, no skill involved.  It is just non-stop clicking of one button and that’s it.  Just keep hitting the same button over and over, occasionally getting swept into some entirely luck-based “Shutdown” or “Bank Heist” mini-game (again playing fast and loose with the word “game”).    It has some entertainment value, for about five minutes, but this is a true test of repeating the same action and expecting different results.

4,2023-08-08 21:46:14,I absolutely love this game. Like I’m obsessed with it seriously. However I just like the customer service or lack there of. If you say you’ll make things right make them right. It’s frustrating to already to have to spend actual monies on the game but it’s ludicrous that I keep paying and not keep getting my rewards without so much as a word from a customer service rep. Ik the risk of online gaming but let’s just be fair. Other than that I can’t get enough of it,Love this game but so disappointed
3,2023-08-20 13:21:20,I really loved this game but now you all making it difficult to enjoy the game since the the pink pack became a weekly win not once I received a new sticker imagine i still waiting for dog tired which is a 4 star card and still cant get...apparently only the ppl that can spend money is the ppl who gets the favor is it a game or a gambling site?????? Is only 11 days till the album expires some ppl wont reach the goal at least give us one or two cards to full a board so we can at least get some dice to roll and enjoy the game... very distasteful,Disappointed
1,2023-08-20 00:59:26,"Had to give this a try but I don’t see what the challenge or point of the game is. It really has nothing to do with Monopoly. You just go round and round a board by pushing a button over and over without doing Monopoly type things, such as buying property or collecting sets, etc. When you collect enough money, you can build up some buildings and then keep going around the board and repeat. No strategy. No skill other than being able to push a button over and over. No fun. If it wasn’t called Monopoly, I wouldn’t care and just write it off as a bad game, but it’s really just using the name to get people to download and it worked.",What’s the point?
4,2023-07-28 18:28:14,if i can not trade a golden card then why can i get a second one of the same card i should get a new card. i love the game but it’s so hard to get my last cards i am down to 9 left i need and i haven’t gotten a new card in WEEKS. and people trading cards are asking money for it or being crazy for what they asking for it. i wish it was easier to get cards because some people are getting to complete it MANY times and i haven’t even completed all the cards once.,i love monopoly go but
1,2023-08-05 14:59:51,I was loving this game so much and have been playing it for weeks until today! Everytime I would hit something good it kept saying game error and made me reload the game. It would usually put me right back where I was when it reloaded but then it happened when playing Peg-E. I had 20 chips to play and I was playing x5 stake. I had 5 chips left and finally hit the first purple pack of stickers that I have been working towards. Then the error popped up again.   It took all my chips I earned away and when I hit finish it did not give me the sticker cards but it gave me the money…. Seems like a set up to me. I expect this to be fixed or I’m done with this game!,Very Upset!
3,2023-08-05 13:58:12,I thoroughly enjoy the game however the amount of money spent on the game doesn’t quantify the lack of cards needed to complete sets and albums. I have no issue with spending the money but it’s not worth it if the odds are against you. Please make it easier to get the cards needed to progress. I’ve also noticed today I can’t get through a roll with out an error message and having to restart. Every time the game crashes I lose my multipliers. Once the hugs and game advantages are fixed I’ll give 5 stars.,Fun game but too many bugs and not enough prizes
5,2023-05-28 15:40:36,Hey this game is complete a masterpiece but for me something that draws it back is that there is no option to choose a profile picture which I hate since I don’t want to log in into something just to make once so I ask that you please make profile pictures something that people can choose instead of the game choosing a random one please let us use or own pictures as a profile,Profile pictures
4,2023-07-16 14:24:25,Like most people I’ve become highly addicted to the game and have formed group chats for helping advance in the game.  The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because getting more rolls is really hard unless you’re going to spend money in the game.  I would rather pay for a game up front than have to constantly spend money daily if I want to play without waiting for hoursss to play.  I think getting large amounts of rolls should be much easier to keep people enthused with playing .,Great game
3,2023-07-15 00:08:11,"Love this game but there’s two things that really bother me when playing. First being the pop ups every time you run out of die or open the app. I don’t need to see them every time, once a day is enough, I would love to be able to turn those off. The other thing is the animations for some things feel unnecessarily too long. When I’m playing during breaks at work, they feel like forever.

After that well not the game has decided since I haven’t spent a dime on it the game has decided I shouldn’t progress any further. In the beginning I could clear 3 levels in one hour. Now I’ve been stuck on the same level for about a week. I only play once a day and when the dice goes to zero ok done until the next day. I like it but not enough to pay to play.,Slot machine

It’s been 19 whole days and the only progression I have with them is that instead of having 151 sets completed, I now have 152 sets completed!!! It’s been 19 days!!!

I have encourage several friends to start playing and they love it as well! However, the more money and rewards I receive the more the app bush out and has to reboot. Sometimes I have to stop playing altogether for a while and it still bugs out when I come back to it.  Maybe an update to fix those bugs???",Love love but
3,2023-10-18 21:58:34,This game is so fun and addicting but I tend to hit lulls while playing. One of the frustrations I have is when playing you can only get further along using multipliers on dice and lose your dice quicker and it’s harder to build them back up without buying more. Also I wish you could trade stickers through the game rather than FB group. That group is not helpful. If there was a better way to post trades on the app or see what stickers others have and request a trade it would be a lot less frustrating.,"Fun, Addicting and Frustrating!!"
3,2023-10-12 15:00:31,"I really like this game but I have to spend too much to win certain prizes. I hate that it cheats a lot and many people have the same problem. I spend money (regretted it) trying to get the 850 dice at the top of the screen and no matter how many times I circled the board, my piece would not land on the tiles I needed it to. I was at 682 and needed 700 tents to win the 850 dice. It waited till I got to 3 dice to finally land on the tile I needed and but then I lost all my dice. And the time ran out to win.

3,2023-09-26 16:31:14,I enjoy this game but after about 4 months of playing it has become clear this is a pay to win game. The amount of dice given is very low. The higher star stickers have become impossible to get. Every pack you open is all duplicates. The duplicate gold cards that can’t be traded are annoying. Given you can save up the duplicate stickers to trade in for a vault but then the vault contains duplicate stickers. The secondary market that has formed around these stickers is crazy.

Second I would definitely recommend joining groups to trade or donate cards on Facebook this is how you will complete your stickers and get more dice, remember you roll higher to get bigger rewards the game even tells you this as you go along.

The craziest thing is that you can’t just close your account and delete the app like most other games. Your request has to go through a process to get your account closed.

Why give us extra gold stickers if you are not able to trade those they need to fix that it’s frustrating seeing you get 4 or 5 star stickers but they are gold and can’t be traded. Also when trading stickers there should be a system where big parties are liable for sending the correct sticker or sending a sticker at all.

The are always trying to get you spend your money on dice. And when there are special games like the baking friends game they make it very unattainable to reach the goal before the game ends. This whole game is rigged for you to get close to winning only for you to run out of rolls and then they push you to buy rolls which you still end up no being able to get far enough. It’s all about money and me and all of my Facebook friends are deleting this game.,Game was fun in the beginning but
4,2023-07-08 15:22:27,The he game is super fun and gets to hooked right away way soon you realize the game is really about getting stickers. The stickers a frustrating I’ve gotten 500 of the same stickers and still haven’t gotten any new one. They do have the option to trade them in once you get s certain amount but i have yet to actually receive a sticker that i actually needed. It’s very frustrating because trading on Facebook has gotten intense and there is s chance you might get scammed.,Stickers
3,2023-06-13 22:31:11,"The game is fun, entertaining and a great time passer, but the pop ups you get when you launch the game or run out of rolls is insane! I have to X out of 4 different pop ups trying to get me to buy more rolls!!! It’s honestly the most annoying thing, I love the no ads thing it’s amazing but the constant shove in my face to buy more rolls and special packs is absurd. Please get rid of that because trust me, we all see the pile of offers and things to buy on the screen already and in the store we don’t need them in our face every time we open the app.",Pop Ups!!!!

3,2023-11-08 16:51:41,The fact that I’ve been playing this game so much and for it to consistently screw me over is ridiculous. I love the game but I just exchanged 600 stars and you guys can’t even give me a new card!?!?!? Why are y’all making it so hard. And that’s the second time. And now there’s an option to buy gold cards but a minimum of $20…. Like…. I’ve been so down for this game but that’s the icing on the cake. If you want to keep people playing maybe guarantee that exchanging what we’ve worked towards actually pays out a little. 😤😤😤,Stars for cards

When I’m on a winning streak the game glitches! It shuts down and push me back ! I’ve won a 15 minute mega heist numerous times , and did not receive my reward!!

I just got the game yesterday and don’t understand why this is happening. I cant build anything because as i said when i do it says error then restarts and puts be back to where i was before i tried building up an area. Besides the error message continuously popping up the game itself is really fun.,Error

I definitely recommend.,Addicting!!!
1,2023-10-29 14:44:37,"Used to be a fun game but now I’m getting bored. I’m not spending hundreds of dollars in your game just to level up or complete challenges. I truly believe this game is rigged in order to get you to try to buy dice. Also when you’re leveling up, you should be earning more dice the further up you go and not just 50 dice at a time. I’m passed level 100 and still earn only earn 50 dice each level I complete. That’s just ridiculous. Don’t even get me started on the sticker packs as well. Unless you’re winning challenges there’s no way to get better stickers. You need to make some changes or people are going to quit playing all together.",Rigged game!

2,2023-10-02 21:09:48,"This game is based on luck with a little bit of strategy. The game is fun, especially with friends but the sticker system is worse than before which is why I’m giving a 2 star rating. Sticker packs used to give ANY rating from 1-5 star stickers for a certain percentage and now you have to get the specific star sticker packs to get a specific rating (5 star stickers only come from 5 star packs and gold stickers only come from gold packs). The packs are very difficult for players that don’t spend money to accumulate. On top of that, rewards for the album have been reduced.",Honest Gamer Review
1,2023-09-28 16:16:05,"I’m so over the error messages, I’m completely over paying for packs of dice and stickers to end up with duplicates I can’t do anything with because even if I cash them in for a vault I get duplicates and like no dice so it’s a complete waste. I feel like the money I’ve spent has completely been wasted, this morning I won the top bar of dice an than mins later I got an error message, my game restarted and all my dice was gone. 7 hours later I can’t get into my game at all.  3 weeks ago I emailed customer support because 1,000+ of my dice went missing and I had screenshots to prove it but no help from them like always.","Screw this game, don’t download this trash!"
2,2023-09-27 17:31:16,The only part of this “game” that’s actually a game is the cash grab… after 60 levels they start to repeat you watch the dice roll they give you fake prizes and money run out of dice in 15 mins and wait hrs for more they’re hoping you spend $20 for another 15 mins of dice… do yourself a favor find a real game or download a gambling app.  The 2 stars are because it’s popular so it’s kind of fun trading with your friends and family but that’s all imo.  *Edit* I find it hard to believe anybody that plays this game would give it 5 stars for any reason other than they were being nice,2 stars for friendship
3,2023-09-21 12:45:08,Completing the album are ridiculous. If I have a 1 star pack why do I receive 2-3 star cards when I need a gold 1 star etc. It doesn’t make sense how hard it is just to receive a card you need for a particular star set. It’s cool to receive those 2-3 star cards but I need a one star gold. Why are regular and gold packs separated? Pretty much have to try to win events or hope and pray it lands on a pack you need when you spin the wheel for higher tier star cards.,Why do you receive every other star car other than the ones you need?
1,2023-09-11 09:09:55,"The game is was cool but now it’s starting to be a scam, it’s been so hard to complete this game because they do not give new stickers. I keep receiving duplicate stickers no matter what I do.. even if purchased they as duplicate. The dice are hard to get as well and super expensive no one in their right mind are going to pay $100 for 3200 dice that goes in secs. The trade sticker thing on Facebook is ridiculous because you help someone and they never help you or lie and say they sent the sticker. This game is not cool. Scopely needs to stop scamming people and lower your prices along with make it a little more easier for customers to play! I do not recommend at all",Such a scam
1,2023-09-06 01:03:59,"Somehow I spent $34 in dice and never received anything tried to dispute and kept getting the run around. High multiplyer dice don’t give much of anything. Monopoly just a wants us to keep spending money. The trade and stickers are trash. Trades should be 10 per day and monopoly gives too many duplicate stickers. Tournaments are hard because who wants to keep spending all that money to get a few dice. And not to mention the albums are a joke. So many people was down to 1 sticker, spent money and still couldn’t get that sticker nor do they offer the tokens in other ways because that is why people play. So many greedy ways this game makes money.",Disappointed!
5,2023-07-23 06:18:36,"This game shouldn’t allow the mechanism to steal every cent you have. I was at 1.6 billion and in one go someone can easily steal it? Doesn’t sit right for a game like this.

But my friends only have to spend 20-30. I’m being punished for spending money on the game???

Then the cards that are tradable people like to scam others over a card. It’s just a game people! And then there is the only 50 dice when you complete a board but y’all keep charging more and more for the upgrading buildings and what not. And why are you charging so much for dice?

2,2023-08-18 18:10:25,"The game is fun when you actually have enough rolls to play for a while. I managed to go from 5 to over 2300 through stickers, tourneys etc. I maintained it for a bit and am back to 0 now. The game is infinitely less fun now. They don’t give you near enough rolls to progress at all. They recharge super slow. To win more rolls, you need rolls generally. The pricing to get more rolls is just silly, $10 for 300 rolls that you could go through in about 5 minutes. You’d likely not land on anything useful and would be back at square one. Please add more rolls. Let me play the actual game.","Fun game, but they limit how much you can play."

The only thing I do not like is that once you complete a board that cost you over a billion to do, you only receive 50 dice no matter how far in the levels you are. I feel like the higher you get in boards, you should receive more dice than 50. People on level 125 get the same as people on 5 & it cost them less than a million to complete a level.

It would be cool if we could buy more rolls with the in-game money, since the only thing we can use that on is upgrading the landmarks right now.   Can’t trade the gold cards at all, even if I have extra of them. And they almost never show up in the bigger card packs. Maybe make it so we can trade for other gold cards at least?   Too many pop ups. Why so many for the same thing: to buy rolls, money, and cards?  I like the art of the maps, and I did have favorite boards! I wish we could go back to the previous maps and just admire the art there!   I’m still playing and it’s easy to get far without paying for anything, which I appreciate!

I’m still being attacked constantly by the same person and I’m honestly about to delete the game which is sad because I’ve probably spent hundreds of dollars on it.

I was number five then it glitches kicks me off. I get back on and somehow or another within a matter of three or four seconds. I'm number seven makes no sense.

I go to roll 200x and land on a space giving me things for an event so I get more dice and cards. Error again. Now I’ve lost that. When I go to roll I don’t get the same result.

4,2023-11-01 01:21:19,"Sometimes it seems like the rolls are against you depending on what the current challenge is set for. Because you can be rolling tons of corners but as soon as the event comes up that requires corners it is as if you cannot roll on them anymore. It also seems like the higher the multiplier sometimes you get worse rolls.

2,2023-10-26 13:12:00,This game used to be my favorite… I was an addict lol we even started a group chat for it… now everything is 3 times harder to get for half of what you used to get! We’re getting less dice less new cards less pegs even less spins! It’s like the creators got money hungry and greedy which there is no need for because we were already spending money before the change… my whole family used to play now its down to just me… my group used to have 30 people now we maybe have about 10… bring the old game back make monopoly fun again!,Sucked most of the fun out of the game
5,2023-09-28 12:35:08,I crave this game! And the animation work on each board is amazing!! And the collecting of the stickers is fun until its starts giving you way fo many duplicates of ones you have and making to difficult to get gold stamps that you can’t share!

I then roll with a x10 multiplier and they ask me to buy more with the same two popups. Then I roll with a x5 multiplier and they ask again.

4,2023-09-07 16:27:26,"This game is very addictive. Absolutely love the concept and the stickers, especially the trading!! My only critiques would be, the game is a little glitchy, not sure if that has to do with my phone in particular or the game itself. Also the gold stickers are SO hard to come by this time around and it seems harder and harder every day to get enough dice to complete challenges.

I truly enjoyed this game, and spent money religiously on it. But I cannot back it up anymore as even when you get the simple one gold star card, it’s dupe after dupe.

Which the game will make sure you use them all. Dice is the only way you can do anything. It’s starting to not be so fun. They cards are harder to come by.

2,2023-08-30 15:29:30,This game was super fun at first. Once you reach a certain level or complete most of your albums it becomes obvious that this game is only pay to play if you want to advance. It is impossible to collect the s’more difficult stickers unless you buy their expensive pack. And the price is seemingly random for each player. You shouldn’t have to fork out tons of money to be able to win the album after playing for 45 days! I’m short two gold stickers and I knew a week ago that I wouldn’t be getting them. Very disappointed.,Fun but only if you pay to play
2,2023-08-27 05:48:10,Is it just me or is MONOPOLY GO not really fun anymore once you get to the higher levels. It’s too expensive to level of up properties. It takes like 500 net worth points to get to the next level but even when you get there you don’t get more dice and the boards just start over from the first one and when you get to start a new board you still get the same amount of dice and money as when you start the game in the beginning. It seems like the only way I can progress in the game is spending really money.  I was just wondering if this was just me or everyone else.   Im at 4929.,Stalemate

4,2023-08-15 00:50:53,I personally enjoy playing the game and it’s awesome that you can trade stickers with others via Facebook but I would like to suggest they add a “Trade” button and then a “Gift” button on the game. I’ve been scammed out of so many stickers it’s not funny. People will claim to have a sticker they want to trade for something you have and when you send them the sticker they delete you and block you and there’s literally nothing you can do about it. That’s ridiculous! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!,Trading stickers

I used the 20x rolls and won a little over $1 million, it applied the “20x” and it gave me a little over $2 million… that isn’t correct. Nor is it correct that I landed on the shield 5 different times while using the 20x rolls - I should have 120 shields protecting me.

1,2023-07-15 21:38:52,"This “game” is horrible and not at all like the classic.  You don’t buy properties; it seems like you already own the entire board.  The game says you can play with friends.  The only thing I found you can play with friends is the Community Chest mini game.  All you do in this game is go around the board collecting rent, go build things somewhere, and maybe knock some strangers building down.  You are not actually playing anybody!  It is downright boring.  Developers, please tell me if I am missing something.  After going around the board endlessly and finding nothing at all entertaining,  I deleted the game.  Please do not waste your time on this.",Worst version of a classic ever

I have restarted my phone, deleted the app, redownloaded it again, and it still takes me to the shut down screen. I even connected the game to my ipad, it let me log in and once it was connected to my account. It took me right back to the shut down screen and I can’t even play the game.

Stickers not showing u in packs and stuck at 0 seconds for free gift. Game been glitching since the patch. Only way to get more rolls is complete album. Only way to do that is you have a lot of rolls. Good luck your not going to complete all the sets unless you pay!!,More adds glitches rip off

For example, if you are on level 75 and you clear the board, you only earn 50 dices...and that's is what you earn from level 1 to 2. Also, I wish that you could earn dice when you take a ride on the railroads. Or maybe purchase dice with your Monopoly money??  Overall, I enjoy this game very much.

The best example is when you level up threw boards you get 50 dice rolls each time. With the increase of the cost of the buildings you need more dice rolls if not you end not even finding it worth to play with less the 100 rolls, and that can take a whole day build up.",Insanely addicting game

You get so many duplicate cards. I literally don’t need anymore 1,2 or 3 star but that’s all I’m getting. I can’t even try for for or five cards. The waiting for dice is really crazy too.

Thought I was mistaken but after last couple time used and seeing I should have had 300 dice and only got 30 added noticed. When should have got some millions and only got hundreds I was scratching my head. I saw some other reviews similar: as a plus and why gave 4 when app was down or messing up other day I was given money and dice to make up for it! Was very dope!,Nice but the math

I don’t like sitting here waiting for the animation to end so I can click off yet another pop up. I’m never going to buy anything so stop trying to force me to.

When I went to request a refund the customer service page for refunds just directs you back to the main support page with no actual point of contact.

Probably because they gained so much popularity and are being money hungry.  The new album has gold cards in every set and they are impossible to get, and once you get them, they are duplicates!! Then the set rewards are significantly lower, even though it’s harder to complete them now.  The app keeps getting glitchy and kicks you out all the time too. It doesn’t count the right amount of cookies for the cake event or the tournaments. The bank heist works half the time so you lose out on the timer/money. Now their last update stopped players from getting dice from Facebook friends!!  They just want us to spend ridiculous amounts of money to get dice (because to get only 8 dice you have to wait a whole hour!!!)

If you don’t pay for rolls, you will never finish upgrading your buildings. If you are like me and a free player, there are no ads you can watch, you can only wait.

There are ways to get more dice, however, you can’t really get enough to play continuously. You either have to spend real money(which isn’t even worth it for the amount of dice it gives you) or wait for it to refill(by ONLY 5).

I completely lost all the money that took me days to win just for all of it to get stolen by a single person. I have screen shots to show proof as well! I’ve never ever came close to stealing anywhere near that. In the biggest bank heist the most I was able to steal was 20 mil.

I’ve never seen a game throw a bunch of offers in your face before. it’s kinda ridiculous. you can easily play the game without paying anything but the game itself is not that interesting to me. All you do is constantly roll a dice and upgrade your buildings. It’s really a brain dead game which is fine if that’s what you’re looking for but i eventually found it extremely boring. At some point i got even frustrated of closing the 50 different offers thrown in my face everytime i opened the app.,Just a Fat Cash Grab

3,2023-06-11 14:21:59,"Great game but there could be improvements, with the more boards you go up the more things cost, so I would like the “inflation” happen to the dice roles, where every board you go up you get 10 more dice roles than last, so instead of getting 59 dice rolls you get 60, then 70 and so on and so forth with each board you go up. Other than that amazing game, and I also wish that the amount for certain $$ was more so instead of 400 dice rolls and $5,000 for $4.99 could be improved to like 10,000 dice rolls and $5,000,000,000 for 4.99 in game.

Tournaments have AI players with randomized scores that are thousands if not tens of thousands points ahead of you. The game does not give stickers until a certain time period in the event.

Also the mega multiplicator thing it’s just a strategy to make you buy more rolls… Plus, it has a lot of bugs still to be fixe, but that’s understandable, because every app has. However, when the app it’s a game, it gets annoying.","It has potential, but…"
2,2023-08-29 16:32:08,So in two days the sticker packs will go away and new sticker packs will take the place. Are y’all going to give us a wealthy amount of rolls and money if we do not complete the stickers? The algorithm to this game and collecting stickers is absurd. No way to trade gold cards to complete your sets is fine but the chances of receiving those gold cards should be higher. I have 346 picka chew cards and still yet to get 6 gold cards needed. I know this won’t get fixed cause it’s a money thing but hopefully people will read this and not invest money and time playing. It’s a lost cause.,To many extra cards
1,2023-08-31 21:23:19,The new season offers less rewards upon completing albums. Every aspect of the game has turned into making you pay to win. Every board is more expensive to complete while the rewards still are the same as completing board 1. Especially this new season you can see that they are just trying to make players spend money to be able to keep playing and it’s disgusting. They encourage you to trade with people on Facebook and get scammed out of cards instead of making a trading system within the app to prevent scamming they don’t care about the player base they only care about making money.,The company is a cash grab.
1,2023-08-31 20:24:57,"The crashing and the glitching is OUTRAGEOUS! They make a new update and it is worse than it was before. New album comes out and you have to work harder to finish it and the payout is lowwwww. Like not even helpful in the game at all. I’ve lost stickers, dice, money and other incentives. I’ve been told to wait 24 hours to see if they’ll appear (they won’t. I’ve been through this before) and then I’ll have to wait 2-4 days to see IF they’ll do anything about it. 2/5 times they have. Horrible odds. I’m so close to deleting but I’ve spent good money on this game and would hate to see it waste because the developers are horrible at their jobs.",No.
2,2023-08-18 14:41:08,"I grew up playing the board game Monopoly and I was excited to play Monopoly Go. I enjoy building landmarks and cash grabs, PEG E the robot 🤖. What don’t like is the limited rolls and the refusal to release stickers to complete the books. Even if you pay for stickers and dice the game doesn’t release them. I feel that they should label this as a gambling game because ultimately you spend money trying to complete the sticker book. I wrote to customer service and they told me “there is nothing we can do about it”.   If you are not interested in completing the sticker book then you will enjoy this game.",It Could Be Better!
1,2023-08-21 21:20:41,"The game purposely makes you spend all your 2000 dice with high roller by making you land on garbage, then gives you a “deal” of 25 dice for $9.99. It’s also way Too hard to get over 100 dice because when you complete most of the sticker sets, your rarely get any new stickers. You should be able to gift dice or have something where you can get dice without dice or irl money. I know people who have spent thousands on this game and have gotten nothing out of it. The game also rips off the people who spend a lot of money by increasing the price by 5x because they bought some things. If the developers of the game see this, please fix this game.",Stupid Game
5,2023-07-07 15:35:57,"To whom it may concern, I always get my quick wins challenges done every day, today there was a big fix and my quick wins reset, now there is no way I will be able to collect enough wins to obtain the blue pack for completing all quick wins, I was really looking forward to getting the blue pack to help me collect the more rare stickers… help if you can  Edit: thank you for the fix! It was a nice surprise and much appreciated!",But fixes
4,2023-08-06 01:36:28,"I love this game so much, but one thing everyone I know that plays this game wants is to be able to gift friends dices and money. It’s such a fun game and I love it so much but that’s just something I think a lot of people would like and also maybe If you play as a guest that you can use a photo in your photo album as your profile picture but it’s just idea, thank you for taking your time and reading this 💕","I love the game so much!!! It’s got me addicted, but I do have a good idea for the game."
4,2023-08-05 22:48:39,I don’t have many complaints about this game except the fact that there are barely any of certain stickers given out. I have so many duplicates from the game but they are all lower stickers. It’s extremely hard to complete the album set when the game won’t give you the stickers that you need. Then they direct you to a Facebook page for “trading” but there are tons of scammers and the admins don’t remove them. So beware.,Not many stickers are given out
3,2023-07-30 16:51:45,"This game is rigged so it can entise you to spend money.  The higher your multiplier, the lower your rolls.  It basically drains your rolls until youre out.  The daily competitions are rigged as well.  How is it possible that someone had 4000 points in less than 5 minutes?  Even with a 100x. Multiplier on, its not possible.  I literally was in second place and the person below me (I'm am sure it’s not an actual person) was able to push me out the way and pass my by 300 points in one minute.  Im definitely quitting after today.",It was fun at first
4,2023-07-27 21:33:27,The algorithms are obscenely transparent on each new challenges and tournaments. The fact that you cannot trade gold cards ruins the whole point. The purchase packs are way too expensive. The duplicate sticker situation is trash. If I’m grinding it out I should be guaranteed a reward not constant duplicates. It has become boring and repetitive to the point it’s not even remotely fun. Fix the game or you will be losing your players and within months this will be a game nobody wants to play anymore.,Blatantly broken
3,2023-07-26 21:12:48,"Starts off great with plenty of rolls and forward projection, really hooks you in. Eventually the rolls will dry up and you will will do you daily rolls and get nothing for it. Stickers are hard to come by either in game or trading and gold stickers not being a trade option makes no sense. It is a hot game right now but honestly users are getting exhausted with the grind. The reward on the spin wheel is 15 die that’s 1 roll for most players. The hype is still here but things need to be fixed before you lose all your users.","Fast start, slow finish"
4,2023-07-15 07:46:49,"Love this game, but there’s tons of pop ups when you open the game after having it closed for a while. not ads, it’s just little extra events and things like that, it just takes forever to click through them all. i think the game would benefit from having small notifications icons over the events at the edge of the screen rather than keeping you from resuming right when opening.",Too many in game pop ups.
4,2023-07-11 12:42:44,I absolutely love this game I cant stop playing it actually just one down side I see on my part is my profile picture I know it’s just a picture but I don’t like mine much because it’s a random picture of a lady and I wish I could change it 😭 but other than that I see no other reason why someone wouldn’t like to play this game it can get very addictive! It’s even more enjoyable when you add your friends to the game as well!!,Change profile picture
5,2023-11-02 18:34:33,"Hi, my game was glitching for quite a while had did not been for the glitches and restarting me over even after I had finished multiple task, including building the little towns.

3,2023-07-07 13:34:33,"The game was fun at first..now it has all kinds of crashes, reloading errors and the list goes on..The amount of money I have spent on the game and keep getting the same stickers..Also when we go higher up we should be able to collect more than 50 dice like come on now..what’s the point if we are going to keep getting the same 50 dice..overall it’s a fun game when it’s not crashing so I can’t give it 5 stars..also I always update my apps so u don’t want to hear oh that’s the problem fix it now!!",Too many glitches
4,2023-04-22 02:20:53,I have had this game for a full day. I do have some suggestions. 1. Adding a chat setting  2. Having an easier way to be able to open the community chest instead of adding friends if your not able to add friends. 3. When you run out of dice rolls should create two options one where you can trade in a certain amount of your money to get more dice rolls and two having friends send you rolls. I do enjoy the game. I hope the suggestions are taking into consideration,Cool
5,2023-10-20 21:23:29,"This game is so fun and addictive! I recommend this to all those board game lovers! I downloaded this and thought, “this is probably going to be some knockoff game.” When I downloaded, I was stunned! There was barley any adds, and I HATE adds! I love this game so much. I’ve only been playing for a day and I’m already so far in the game. To whoever made this game, I LOVE YOU!!! Omg omg omg omg omg omg omg I can talk about this game all day. You can play with friends, you can play by yourself, just WOW!",Wow!
1,2023-11-02 12:47:43,"Great game but ridiculously expensive and very difficult to win prizes that can keep you playing.  I haven’t received any new stickers in a very long time so it’s impossible to complete sets. Most of the time you win copies of the same stickers over and over. The special competitions like the car partners is fun because you’re able to actually win dice which otherwise come in small amounts. I’m extremely high in levels and you still receive the same small amount of dice to complete every level, no matter how high up you go. Big changes need to be made, no one can afford to play this game.",Way too expensive
4,2023-11-01 16:48:52,I really love this game. But I’m starting to get really irritated with the fact it’s constantly telling me to restart the game cuz of an error I can’t update my board without it saying it. Especially during this ghost car event I’m so close but everytime I do something. It says restart the game and boom no longer had the stuff I had originally gotten and now ima loose the rolls in this event . I’m so close into deleting it is there just an update or what ? I’m so frustrated,4 stars for right now
2,2023-10-24 05:27:31,"I had a lot of fun starting this game today. I got a lot of dice in the beginning and it made it fun to play. However after running out I noticed that you only get 5 dice every hour. I suppose over night that makes sense but to want to just play during the day, it seems like a waste for a refill time of that long. Even 5 every 30 minutes would be better. Then they constantly bring up ads for you to buy for dice. I’ll probably stop playing this game in a day or so, which is a shame because it’s actually enjoyable",Needs a faster dice refill
5,2023-09-28 16:37:13,"I like playing this game - however, there are lots of issues. Like the farther you get in the game the harder to complete a board because it costs more and you don’t earn any faster or get any more dice. You get the same stickers over and over and very rarely get the ones you need. Plus there are times that you get an error message and the game won’t open.",Fun game but issues throughout
1,2023-10-15 23:06:46,I’ve been playing the game for a few months. It’s slowly becoming less fun as the higher levels are harder and they are trying to get you to spend money.  The real frustrating part is they are letting someone consistently attack me who is not on my friends list. I keep having to rebuild my buildings making progress even slower. They also allow them to steal money via bank heists when again they aren’t on my friends list. Then I can only attack them once and I don’t have the option to pick them again. I have no way to block this person. It’s making the game pointless.,Let me block people
1,2023-10-08 07:27:21,"The game starts out fun, but after reaching a certain level the total amount of rolls you can regenerate is only 80 , but you have to gain over 25 billion dollars. The other thing is they don’t resolve issues the right way. I had an issue several times where my partner, or myself leveled up for the partnered events and the other didn’t get their rewards. Instead of giving the reward they took our progress back a level, and returned a fraction of the pieces used to level up and 25 rolls. Disregarding our time spent and practically robbing us of not only our rolls and event pieces but a fair, unabridged chance to complete the tournament.",Disappointed
1,2023-10-05 21:49:27,"Game definitely has a system built in place to make everything aggravating. On the days of the challenges before hand you would of had no problem hitting certain spots on the board; as soon as the challenge shows up, you are going to waste 70% of them hitting back to back Luxury Tax, landing in jail, community chest, free parking. I only hit the railroads by chance cards or I get the rare time where I roll a 3 and land on it. I only use 10 dice a roll and I’m quick to notice when i have it in auto or I’m actually pressing spin and my dice go from 1500 to 1100 while on hitting the railroads from a chance card is insane.",Absolute waste of time
3,2023-09-14 20:13:44,"I love this game and honestly would give it another star but the more you play gives you no extra advantage. The money goes up that you receive but so does the price of things. I started playing it on another phone to help my sticker game and I get bigger dice and more opportunities just starting out then for a game I sunk money in and have more invested in. Also on the special events that you invite friends to, sell the spins not the dice and people would buy spins to upgrade their cakes or cars or whatever",The more you play
5,2023-09-08 21:52:14,I truly was loving this game. But now there are toooooooo many glitches. I haven’t received my prizes or dice. I have contacted customer service SEVERAL times and nothing. Tells me to wait 5 days!!! By that time there’s been other challenges going on and I missed my chance. The newest update SUC*S. I didn’t have this many problems before. Get it together or a lot of people will be deleting their game.,Not getting my stuff

I even spend money to try to complete building the cars, while my partner or partners dont help at all or barely help then they stop leaving me to build the entire car while they reap the benefits of me building alone and spending my money.

1,2023-09-03 01:19:39,Started out fun but there is no reward for getting to high levels just higher prices w not high rewards.  The new card pack event is a rip off making it even harder to get cards you need especially when you are at a higher level.  The boards recycle they give you the same boards w a different city name.  You only generate 8 dice an hour that you will use in 5 minutes or less.  It’s just so impossible to get anything worth anything that you loose interest in the entire game all together.  I’m level 200 and still only get 50 dice for completing a board but my cost to get out of jail went way up!,Not worth it anymore
2,2023-08-15 03:10:50,"I recently tried out MonopolyGO, and I have to say, it left me feeling quite frustrated. While the concept is interesting, the execution falls short in several ways. The gameplay mechanics are convoluted and not as intuitive as I had hoped. Additionally, the in-game purchases and microtransactions felt intrusive, constantly pushing for more spending. The overall experience lacked the charm and simplicity of the classic Monopoly game, which was a disappointment. I appreciate the effort to modernize the game, but there's definitely room for improvement in terms of user experience and balance.",Frustrating and disappointing
5,2023-07-10 13:11:01,"I love Monopoly Go! However, I noticed that when we play with multiplier you so t always get the rewards due to you. For example, you win something thru the chance card like say 702k with a x10 multiplier the reward should be 7.02 Million. But that is not the case. Similarly, you use the cash to buy property but, you do t see it. The money just disappears. Please fix it! Thanks",Greta game but multipliers do t give the actual amount due!
3,2023-08-11 03:30:55,"The mechanics of the game are great, but there are many annoying qualities such as the 5 pop ups you get immediately about spending money to get more things. Another thing is that you run out of dice fast, and when you are low on dice you won’t land on anything to bring them up again, or you won’t land on spaces to progress the events to get more dice. When you do run out, you are greeted with 3 more pop ups. The algorithm is quite obvious, and because of this I will never spend money on this app.",Could be better
3,2023-07-11 12:41:57,"In my opinion, I love this game. It’s actually the only game I would put money for just because it is addicting and I love the challenges they have. I’d recommend playing. But the only thing is, is that they should make a payment option where you don’t have to keep rebuying dice every time you run out. I give it a 3 rating because it’s not like the original monopoly that you play with family, it’s the original board but the way you play I wasn’t taught to play that way lol so it was kind of challenging to get used too.",Monopoly Go
5,2023-06-04 22:11:36,Fell in love w/ monopoly in 2017 in college when I learned the game. I’ve had an iPhone since iPhones were a thing and this is the FIRST & ONLY game where you can experience it 100% even if you do not purchase in the app. So many ways to WIN & get prizes you don’t even have to buy anything in app if you don’t want too! I’m on day 2 and I’m about to win my Fourth BOARD!! I LOVEEEE THIS GAME. I usually never write app reviews but I LOVE this app please never change it,AMAZING 10/10!!!
3,2023-06-24 12:44:44,The game is fun but it could be better. First it takes to long and is to hard to get dice. The easiest way to get dice is to pay real world money. Which basically makes the game pay to play. Second the sticker system and trading with the stickers need to change. Not being able to trade gold stickers makes it almost impossible to finish sets. Obtaining sticker packs is even harder then getting dice. You could spend all day winning packs but 99% will be a duplicate and not one you need/ new sticker.,Good but could be better
2,2023-06-22 11:53:26,I was enjoying playing the even though you have to wait an hour for rolls which is the whole point of the game. Like any app they offer in app purchases where you can buy more rolls. On two separate  occasions I brought additional rolls. Each time I was charged more. The first they charged me for the same deal twice. The second time they charged me for a more expensive deal. I only purchased one offer because it came with additional items. After I was denied a refund for a purchase that I did not make I knew it was time to delete the game.,This game steals your money!

It’s fun and with a crazy world it actually breaks the monotony of life.   I would like to see better prizes when finishing boards. 50 dice when you finish a board? That’s all? How about a 100 and for every 10 boards finished 200. Also add in better packs that actually have a new card and a gold card. Or even better let us give the gold cards.,More Dice
3,2023-09-28 19:40:16,I was in the middle of playing then it keep saying sorry game has to start over it kept doing that and is still doing it…. I just won dice n finally a new sticker… u can buy coins or money they give you the same stickers I been had the same stickers for over 2 weeks I finally got a new sticker…. This technically problems need to be fixed because that’s not fair to the ones that’s really using money sometimes…… 8 dice every hour y’all just want us not to ever win frfr……,Always something wrong

3,2023-09-23 18:40:57,This game is funa nd addictive but it is discouraging when the game doesn’t give you your rewards multiple times.  Multiple times it has shown that I received a prize of dice but the number was not added to my dice. I have also hit the prize point in the contests and it seemed to be “hung up” because it would not give me the prize or move forward on the progress bar even though I landed on spaces that gave me tokens toward the prize.   The game needs to be more reliable in order to be fair to the players.,Fun but not reliable
3,2023-09-22 01:23:26,"First off, this is a super fun game and great way to pass some time and relax. The one thing I hate (and curious if others feel the same way) is how someone can just repeatedly attack your buildings since on shutdowns you can choose your opponent. A limit on how many times one person can attack another per day (or per 12 hours) would prevent that. It’s certainly fun to attack friends but then there is overkill, especially when you’re such a high level and the cost to repair and complete a board is astronomical.",Shutdowns
1,2023-09-19 20:02:49,"Seriously annoying how difficult it is to get stickers and dice rolls on this app. They feed you an addiction and then don’t let you play when you don’t have dice. Then they expect you to pay for dice which you WILL DO. ALL good FREE WAYS TO GET DICE ARE SHUT OFF when the company finds out about it. APP IS ONLY AFTER YOUR MONEY!! The aim is to get all sets of stickers, but they only reward you with ones you already have. Somebody I know spent $500 on this game and packs and still wasn’t able to get all of the stickers needed to complete his set. Ridiculous real life money scam.

5,2023-08-22 11:36:26,The game is great but I don’t like that it takes 8 freaking hours to get an reupholster. I’ve spent money on top of money trying to finish my whole album still no avail my daughter has finished the album twice now on her third go round. I’m high ranking on the list it’s not fair I’ve won #1 in the tournaments and still can’t get one simple gold card. I’m getting less interested in the game day by day  Thank you,Sabrena Everett
2,2023-09-12 20:09:42,"I used to really enjoy this game but now it’s so many things that irritate me. Starting with some people can always find your board and attack your board but when you go to find them in your friends you can’t only in revenge but revenge only lets to attack once after they attack you. So I got this kid tearing my board up but I can only attack his board if I catch him in the moment or once. I feel like after the update I don’t get nearly as much dice, stickers, or shields. Which these 3 things run the game pretty much. The game is overall become unfun",Game has changed for the worst
3,2023-09-10 04:59:54,I absolutely love this game and enjoy the camaraderie with fellow players. I have been a little disappointed with the second season as it has been more difficult to get rolls. I was really looking forward to the baking tournament but found that all of my hard work in acquiring cookies to bake our cakes was in vain. Every spin results in low numbers…Why is this so much harder than last season? I’m not enjoying it as much. Please change the algorithm for rolls and spins to allow a fair mix of high and low numbers.,Second season sadness
1,2023-09-07 19:00:43,I have been playing this game for months now but I’m noticing a couple of issues.  1. You don’t get rewards to balance out the dice you use. It doesn’t have to be 50/50 but it definitely should be better mid term rewards. You spend 28K dice to win 5K.   2. When doing events like baking events. When you land on the cookies the 3rd-4th time you won’t receive your cookies. You can use as many as 300 dice to land on cookies 3-4 times. So that’s not fair.   3. When there are issues you cannot get immediate support. The best you can do is enter a message in Chat Now but there is never a resolution. They say we will send an email in 5 days if we find an issue. Or you get we will look into the issue then a request for a survey of your support. WHICH YOU GET NO SUPPORT!   Besides the issues with receiving your earned rewards and not being able to get immediate support. The game is fun but if I don’t see the system working properly soon I will have to stop playing.,Fun but Feels like a Rip Off
3,2023-08-27 15:22:15,Been trying to collect and trade with family/friends for the albums. Decided since the albums was about to renew I would trade in 1500 stars for the chance of finishing one out of the 6 decks i’m waiting for a gold card for. Then I proceeded to get three gold duplicate cards. They should really have a thing where you can trade gold cards for gold cards cause it’s so stupid other wise. I do enjoy the game but you really have to pay to play to get all the challenges. Annoyed over the lack of chances to finish decks.,Pay to play
4,2023-08-27 04:29:10,I love the app. I don’t really like to play real monopoly but this extremely fun being able to play with friends. The only critique and negative I have is that I wish there was more ways to get dice. I don’t have the money to keep purchasing bundles. It would be great to be able to play some puzzles or watch ads to get dice. Besides that I have recommended the game to many of my friends and will continue to play!,I love the game but wish there was more ways to get free dice
1,2023-08-26 23:45:59,"I understand the luck aspects with getting stickers and all but if ya have spent a minimum of 200 dollars on this game then you should complete the album, I have sears to do so and I believe it is ridiculous I put time and money into your game and constantly am I getting disappointed, I have not received a new sticker in 20 some days that is ridiculous, I would greatly appreciate if y’all looked into this because I do enjoy the game it’s just the fact if I was to want to complete this album I spend 70 dollars for one bundle that only guarantees one new card.. 70•10 is 700 dollars and that’s even more ridiculous.

Now that we have less than a week to finish & I only need 2 gold cards to finish & can’t get anything new. It’s very discouraging & it makes me wanna delete the game all together & tell my friends too. There are several people that I have seen that have completed it 2 or 3 times & I can’t even complete it once. I have gifted so many cards to help other people out. Been scammed several times.,Disappointed
3,2023-08-25 13:46:23,I wish you guys implement a proper trade system where we don’t have to send a very rare sticker to someone first not knowing weather or not that person will send what they promised or just disappear. Maybe something were we both select the sticker we agreed on trading and there are 2 options to confirm trade giving us a fair chance to make a successful trade plus a chance to change our minds if the other person tries scamming us or changing the sticker at the last moment.   Yours respectfully  Monopoly Go player,Trade system
3,2023-08-25 12:54:22,"I will start by saying I like the game a lot. But… There are some issues with it. You don’t get enough dice, or heists. The mega heists don’t even work. ( I have screenshots to prove this but there is no way to attach them here )The stickers are always duplicates and when you trade them in, you get a tiny amount of dice ( 10-20 ) and more duplicate stickers making it impossible to complete sets unless you are willing to spend a fortune in real money just to buy your way through the game. As I titled this review, this game needs work.",Needs work
2,2023-08-23 10:12:01,"Great game when it actually works.  Tons of glitching and most times you don’t get the rewards showing in the game.  I currently have 129 of the peg-e tokens I cannot use.  When you tap the icon to use them, the game freezes up and you have to close the app and restart.  I’ve had this issue non-stop since the last update.  Very frustrating to not be able to claim rewards and the game freezes all the time.  I’d hate to see what happens when you actually pay money for anything on the app.  I haven’t purchased anything because of it .",Great game when it works
5,2023-10-31 16:05:26,"The amount of bugs in this game is ridiculous funny and entertaining by now. At first, i got so frustrated about how often these bugs occur and not completely fixed, to the point I tell myself “Oh, it’s one of those bugs again”. It’s like a player becomes alarm-fatigued from the bugs and just accepted it as ‘part’ of the game moving forward.",Bugs like bed bugs all over
4,2023-08-20 11:49:18,"Game is fun, absolutely fun. However, why does it take 1 hour just to get 5 rolls? This is a tactic to make a person spend money to get rolls. I think the time should be lowered, it’s not like you can get more than 40 rolls if you wait for the time. So, why not have 30 min for 5 rolls instead of 1 hour. Other than this, I think the game is very fun, but the amount of time it takes to gain rolls again, would be the reason I no longer play.",Fun but needs some tweaking
2,2023-08-12 15:23:15,This game used to be fun and fair when I first downloaded it a few months back. The creators have updated the game and rigged it for you to lose and spend money that won’t yield any big wins.   Also they’ve made it so if you have a high multiplier and leave the game and come back it will reset your multiplier to the lowest setting. New stickers are hard to come by you only receive lower one star stickers and usually multiple dupes of stickers you already have. When you purchase dice you only land on non relevant spaces. And railroad only brings up shutdowns. It’s time to delete.,Game is rigged
1,2023-08-02 19:18:48,"The game is cool and fun, but you can’t get stickers to complete sets.  The trading page on Facebook everyone wants stickers for a million stars, some are asking for money for them to complete sets, people are scamming people for stickers.  It’s so annoying and in the meantime the game barely gives out 5 star stickers which everyone needs. Free game, yeah right if you don’t buy a million packs for extra dice and a shot at a sticker you  need you get targeted and have to rebuild your properties constantly so it takes forever to get to the next level.  They need to fix issues so the game can be enjoyable after you hit a certain point.",Do not download
4,2023-05-16 06:49:02,"I play this game everywhere, at my parents house, on the toilet, in my room, ect. The dynamics are fun and it’s something great for friends and family to stay connected. Especially since it can be hard to keep up sometimes it’s keeps you involved. NOW, that being said it would be nice ,to have the option, if you can use the menu while using the auto roll…only thing that really came to mind :) other wise W game",First of all I want to say this is a great game
4,2023-04-19 20:47:14,Absolutely love this game and rated it four stars. Would give it 5 stars if more than 5 dice an hour was given . Takes forever to get enough dice to do anything . And only allows up to 40 dice so doesn’t collect any more after that. If you could change it or make it easier to get dice instead of it being a pay to play game basically it would be a lot better . Isn’t even an option to watch ads for extra dice or anything .,Monopoly go
4,2023-11-05 15:45:21,I love the game. However some things really need to be worked out. It’s very addicting and fun but there are way too many pop ups for things. Some of the algorithms are predictable. We should get a full dice refill in an hour. You should also change the algorithms up on the Shutdowns. We don’t want to constantly get our friends over and over. Why would you want to take away  someone that could help on certain challenges.,😊
4,2023-11-02 02:55:32,The games definitely fun to play but getting new cards seems to be getting harder and harder you just get the same cards over an over again an struggle to complete the sets. As well as the car things they have it seems to be getting harder to finish all the cars. There needs to be more that just 4-5 things on the board to get wheels or whatever it is to go towards the car,Make things a little easier
2,2023-11-01 16:45:47,"This game is beyond infuriating. Not only have the events and card collecting gotten even more ridiculously difficult. But this Spooky Car Event is a JOKE. For the past hour the game crashes and won’t even let me on to TRY to complete my final car. That’s right, I’m ONE car away, and it keeps crashing on me. I joined this stupid game because my friends asked me to, but I’m about done with it. It’s one thing after another with this game and the developers care more about money than making a game that’s fun AND winnable without shelling out hundreds of dollars.",Frustrated Doesn’t Cover It
5,2023-10-21 21:43:39,It’s a good game as you keep playing and playing you’ll get more rewards as a new player you’ll get blessed at first but as you progress there’s a couple things that you’ll start seeing decline something crucial to the game and that the dices and the repetitive stickers… that’s when you be like aii and then close the game with the hopes you’ll get more missions to complete more things.. thank you,good game🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
1,2023-10-30 19:27:46,"03:21 PM You are making this game so very UNPLEASANT! You complain about the people who cheat, but you are cheating so many people right now with this SCAM you call a partner event! People are using over 10,000 🛞 and still haven’t completed one car! Terrible! The spin wheel is a scam! It glitches and it’s fixed to NOT land on any of the gold numbers! AWFUL! It went from 60k to 80k and each intermediate prize is low and REPEATED stickers!  The sticker packs are absolutely ridiculous! We habe no other way to win them except the tournaments and we are up against ppl who pay  soooo much money and end up in 1st place with about 30k!

5,2023-10-12 19:16:35,I never play board games online because sometimes I think it’s rigged but this game is so fun and exciting and doesn’t seem rigged at all or predictable. I’ve been playing for a week now and you can say I’m addicted to stealing properties and making cash. Def would recommend this game. Never knew how to play monopoly before and I think I’ve learned more about it now that I’ve been paying.,Fun and exciting
5,2023-09-14 20:44:03,This is the first game I really enjoy playing everyday! I don’t have to put money into it and it is still a lot of fun with a lot going on at once. You don’t get stuck having to spend money in order to go anymore in the game. So far I’m liking everything about it and first time I invited anyone I knew to join me. I have only been playing  a couple weeks and hope it stays this way!,Love it
4,2023-10-02 02:32:57,The game is fun but not as fun as people make it seem and it is really annoying because I think there is a bug where someone keeps getting  me for the shutdown and its really annoying every second I leave the game I get attacked by candy coate and it’s really annoying but that just me and my personal problems. The game is really fun you should play it on your free time and at home but if you get easily annoyed I don’t recommend all though it is fun.,Good but bad
4,2023-09-19 10:44:15,"LOVE this game. Kills the time, it’s FUN. At first. Then I feel like it’s rigged. They obviously want you to spend money and if you don’t, you’re never close to winning the tournaments or getting the next prize, or getting a sticker packs complete, etc. I played through 300 dice rolls and didn’t land on a railroad once because if I had I would have unlocked the prize of 200 dice and got to keep playing. Makes me want to stop playing altogether sometimes.","I was obsessed, until"
5,2023-08-13 07:25:20,Ok so at first I didn’t really think that that game was all that much all my friends had it my mom had the game there moms had it until one day my mom was telling me about the game and I finally downloaded it and to my surprise I actually love it 😂 and me and my mom have a great time playing it and it’s funny when she gets mad at the game 😂😂 but we all love it plz make more games like this monopoly love you guyz,I actually enjoy this game💗
2,2023-08-29 17:38:03,"I downloaded this game because it looked fun, and for about a month it was.  Then I got real about how much money this app was asking for EVERY. DAY. I don’t mind spending maybe $5-$10 to have a fun day(a full one), but if you want to keep playing and finish anything that comes with prizes, you gotta choke up some serious cash.   Here’s an example. I am 2 Gold cards away from finishing this month’s album. They are asking for ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS for 2 digital cards I won’t even have anymore when the new album starts in Sept.  Absolutely ludicrous and money hungry.   Not to mention there are so many people on the Facebook groups that will scam you out of cards, steal your invite link to destroy your board, and try to sell cards(besides gold because the app won’t let you trade those) instead of trading or gifting honestly. It’s too much of a headache and too much hassle. Deleting this app immediately until they get real.",DELUSIONAL
3,2023-08-27 06:43:20,"While this game is great… great concept, fun, addictive, connected to friends etc I think it could use some improvements on the prizes/tournaments. I also play coin master and I know it’s been out longer so they have had time to improve but it gives a lot more opportunities to increase spins. The spin prizes gained in tournaments here is ridiculously low. I get the point is to make money for the app developers but the people who spend are gonna spend and the people who don’t aren’t gonna start now.",App Needs some improvements
1,2023-08-21 21:14:34,Hard to get dice. You get the same stupid card over and over again. (If you exchange them you aren’t even guaranteed  a new sticker) CANT TRADE GOLDS BUT I HAVE DUPLICATES. Community chest is useless and I never got a pink pack from it. ( add ice too)  Peg board is rigged every time I swear I can be close to the middle and it always finds a way to move to the next number or all the way to the ends immediately. You would also think they would give you more dices when you clear boards since they like the raise everything else yet they don’t! Y’all need to start looking at feedback and reviews and figure it out cause everyone is saying the same thing.,ANNOYING
4,2023-08-13 14:59:07,It’s a great game that causes family feuds just like real life Monopoly lol. It’s pretty addictive and the ONLY thing holding it from being 5 stars is the gifting policy. It’s weird to get pop ups about joining a Facebook page to trade and gift stickers only to find out that I cannot gift a particular card I have a duplicate of to another player. It would be nice to know in advanced what cards can’t be gifted/traded but it would be even nicer if ALL cards could be gifted/traded regardless.,Great except gifting…
5,2023-07-15 11:30:21,Very sad that after you get high up on levels you still only get 7 dice spins per hour. Your dice spins should increase with each level. Impossible to move ahead with accumulations that small and slow. And I’m not cheap I spent 50 bucks on the game this week alone. I have no problem spending money on a game but now that I’m at a higher level you literally can’t play unless you do.,Love the game!
2,2023-07-30 05:36:20,No matter how fun a game is I need to be kept engaged! What can quickly turn me off is absurd rules such as waiting 1 whole hour for just 5 rolls & then it stops once you hit 40 (which btw is 8 hrs of waiting). There are games that allow refreshes as low as 5 minutes.  Levels getting harder with no semi easy ones in between (being stuck on one level for days). Things like this will make me stop playing. I don’t want to be stuck on a level for days at a time because I’m waiting an entire 8 hrs for a decent amount of leverage to actually play.,1 hr wait is absurd!!

I can’t tell you how insanely irritating it is to log into the app and get no less than 5 pop-ups, or after you run out of rolls you get more pop-ups. Sometimes I stop the dice before it runs out of rolls just to avoid those stupid pop-ups. I get it… you need people to buy whatever, but you should overhaul the frequency of the pop-ups or allow people the option to turn them off.

3,2023-07-10 02:29:14,"I like the game overall but they should allow dice to continually add up even though you are beyond maximum capacity. It takes forever to generate dive and you have to be under the max of 60 or 80 dive to begin generating dive again. They should also allow for dive to generate every 30 minutes instead of every 60 minutes.   The challenges are fun but it takes so much to attain them.

5,2023-06-29 03:22:40,I really enjoy playing the game and like how user friendly it is. I love the fact that we can trade cards but what is the point of getting duplicate gold cards if they aren’t available for trade ?!   Like can you find something else to do with them like can we exchange them for other random gold cards like 2-5 to be able to trade for one or trade them in for rolls.   Or just let us trade all cards. 🤷🏽‍♂️🥴🤣,Love the game !
1,2023-11-09 04:55:43,"When they have an event that spans months and you faithfully play every day AND spend money along the way, and you still cannot complete the event in time, I’d say the game is a big waste of time.      I’ve given it a chance even though I see how the rolls seem rigged to make you run out of dice just before you reach a goal, so that you will be tempted to purchase more dice.     I understand that you make money off of people’s desire to keep playing. I just say to you, play fair. Give events that rewards daily play, not spending money.    Typical Scopely.

4,2023-08-23 23:11:19,It’s a great game to keep you busy but unless you buy the packages you wont get any gold cards and I notice every time you get close to winning something big you wont land on the things to finish getting it like for example i kept getting chips to play the robot and now that I’m close to winning the packages I all of a sudden stop getting chips but of course you can keep playing you just have to buy chips smh!!! So yes I will give it 4 stars !!,Only 4 stars
4,2023-08-20 02:49:26,For all these people who say they can’t advance or that it’s a pay to win game 🤣🤣🤣 it’s a skill issue but this game doesn’t even take any skill. It’s all luck and picking your cards right but there’s no cards to pick lol  Games fun but when you don’t have dice it’s boring especially when your up in higher lvls cause everything is more expensive.  Not bad for a time passing game but you have to wait for time to pass to play lol,Im lvl 1600 and I haven’t bought anything
1,2023-08-15 12:18:03,"This game is really fun and a little addictive, however, it’s gotten increasingly hard to use the cards to your advantage. I get several card packs but they’re ALL duplicates. It takes weeks to get a new card. The game encourages trading cards online but that should NOT be the only way to fill out a deck to win prizes. A lot of people on the social media groups don’t want to trade or will pretend to trade to get your card then leave you before giving you the card you need. It’s ridiculous. I put this game down a lot because I only seem to do well when I spend money. I’m kind of sick of games that keep their hands in your pockets.","Super Fun, BUT"
5,2023-07-28 12:57:59,Really enjoy this game. However we would like to be able to add as many people as we can to get dice because the higher you get the less dice you receive. At some point people are going to quit. Especially with the multiple duplicate STICKERS we receive. It’s really challenging and that’s why we enjoy it but we also would love to reach the milestones at some point. Once again I love the game😀,Best game EVER
1,2023-08-12 08:05:33,"This game is very addicting and it’s a craze right now. But the way it’s going people are going to start losing interest real soon. How is it that it take $100M to complete a board, yet you only get $2.2M and 50 DICE once completed. Yet every level the amount it takes to get out of jail goes up, the amount to complete the board goes up, but not the amount of dice you receive. You can’t play the game without dice and wait an HOUR for 7 dice is insane. Also these stickers!! How is it that we continue to get duplicates and everyone is looking for the same cards, but even if you buy them, you still get duplicates?! Very frustrating",If Only
1,2023-08-07 23:13:44,I’ve submitted manyyyy issues to customer service and have not heard back about a single one. Extra annoying considering I’ve spent money on the game and the supposed response time is “2-4 days” and it’s been wellllll over that.  Don’t waste your money. The game will crash and you’ll lose the dice and stickers you paid for. On top of other glitches and bugs. I loved the game until this issue arose. Really disappointed that the customer service isn’t better considering everyone I know has had or is having issues and are not getting responses either…,Still waiting to hear back from customer service
5,2023-06-14 15:18:18,I love  Monopoly go so much. I never am able to find a  game that I actually enjoy playing. Their is also no ads and your able to add friends and invite people to play with you. Ever since my latest birthday I got the board game monopoly and it was SO FUN then one day I was playing one of my boring games and a add was talking about this monopoly go and it looked fun so I got the app and it was the best day ever I actually found a game that I really liked.,SO FUN
2,2023-07-05 12:56:50,What’s the purpose of giving duplicate gold cards if they can’t be traded? I think they we should be able to cash them in for dice or money. And why is is so hard to be obtaining certain cards? Most every pack only containing one new card. Or opening duplicate packages and not getting a single new card! The game is starting to get boring because we need dice to play not every ones want or can buy dice. I just think it should be more ways to obtain dice in reference to the duplicate gold cards and make it a little more easier to obtain certain cards.,Obtaining Cards/ Card Issues
5,2023-05-22 04:22:12,This game I enjoy. It brings back childhood memories with a twist. I love the fact that you can destroy a friends property and gave the chance to rob their bank. It makes it more interesting and fun to bring out the competitiveness. One thing I wish we could do is send each other rolls like we can with stickers even tho it’s plenty of opportunity’s to get rolls if you run out. All in all a very good addictive game.,Fun game and addictive
1,2023-05-25 17:18:31,Constantly getting prizes where the card says x20 or x10 but then I only receive the exact value listed on the prize. It’s stupid. If I get a chance card that says win 30 rolls and separately has a space that says x20 I would expect to get 600 rolls. If the price value is already multiplied then the card should state the original value so you aren’t constantly feeling cheated by the game. I don’t even know why the original prize would be 1.5 rolls. Something has to be wrong with the app. Or if the prize isn’t being multiplied by the number of rolls I’m using then it shouldn’t show the 20x on the prize card.,It’s a fun game but don’t waste your money
5,2023-05-10 19:28:04,This game is good but not what I suspected. I thought I was going to get the original monopoly game and not getting dice every 5 hours or something. There is a lot of game adds* for 2 bucks or something. It is not bad but if you do not like game adds popping up in your face every time you run out it is not really the game for you. I do recommend this game but I wish there will be the monopoly like the bird game not the new one right now.,Good
5,2023-05-07 15:14:57,"Okay, so you’re probably wondering why this is the best game I’ve played in a long time. The reason is because, the game is so addictive, and fun especially when you land on railroads because, you either get to rob other players banks or, break other players buildings. You will usually never get bored if you’re a monopoly addict like me. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.🫶🫶🫶⭐️⭐️⭐️🩵🩵🩵❤️❤️❤️❤️🩷🩷🩷",Best game I’ve played in a long time
5,2023-11-02 12:32:56,"I really like this game it’s really fun you get a lot of good extras but since I’ve been playing for a while, it seems like it’s getting harder and harder to get more prizes. it’s harder to get more four-star cards. It’s harder to finish some of the mini games just like this last past Halloween car game and it’s harder to get more dice. I’m not going to spend extra money just to buy a dice","Love the Game, But"
5,2023-11-01 16:25:36,"I started playing today. I completed two of my cars. While trying to complete my board, my game kept saying error and resetting if it did it once it did it 100 times no matter what I did it would take me back to a certain spot. However, they did not give me my money or my wheels back!!!! Now I won’t be able to complete any more cars 😡 just wrong!!!",Just wrong
5,2023-10-11 09:41:32,"It’s a fun game, but I think you should be able to send your friends daily dice, like in other games you can send them “lives”, you should be able to send your friends dice. It also takes a long time for dice to generate, and if you’re using x10 or x20 it only takes a few trips around the board until you’re out of dice again.",Fun but needs some changes
4,2023-10-29 05:00:03,"Becomes a money grabbing game In order to win prizes. Make it to where we can start a friends club where we can gift each other dice and other charms. Would make the game more fun Family and friend interactive. Prizes should have better dice chances. Let’s be serious it would cost well over $2000 just to win the big prizes without friend and family interaction. Be realistic and budget friendly!!! Fun game though, I genuinely enjoy it.",Need more incentive
1,2023-10-29 01:05:57,How is it possible that someone I’m not even friends with can attack me over and over and over and over and constantly do bank heists but I can’t attack them or do bank heists on them that is entirely unfair this means I’m being taken from more than I can receive because more people are coming for me than I can go for…. At this point I have deleted the game I enjoyed playing but I work 15 hour shifts only to want to play to wind down and I have to build all of my money back up because people who aren’t even my friends are bank heisting me for freaking 40 million and I can’t do it back !!!!!!!!,Unfair game play
1,2023-10-17 03:25:51,The new sticker album has really ruined the game. Everyone needs the exact same stickers. When you complete an album the reward of dice rolls has drastically reduced. When I first started playing me and my teammates were able to complete the event. But since the release of the new sticker album it is very difficult to impossible. Now they allow trading of gold stickers. But you only have so many hours to trade and you can only trade the two stickers. One of the ones we can trade hardly anyone has. Obviously this game is a money grab. I hope people don’t put cash in this game.,Changes make this more of a joke
1,2023-10-11 14:56:26,"I love this game if it was fair it’s impossible to get new stickers, I’ve opened over 300 plus stickers and have not gotten any new stickers yet, also the board doesn’t give you the correct dice amount back when you lands on the shield, and I’ve landed on the train so many times and the bar is not moving, this game is becoming a scam to get you to constantly buy more dices, and I brought 3 package that supposedly guarantees a new gold sticker but I didn’t even get a new sticker, less known a gold sticker I’m about to delete the app therefore I want think about playing, they’re barely giving you decent amount of dice anyway",MonopolyGO
5,2023-09-18 06:13:21,"If you’ve played or have CoinMaster- MonopolyGO is by the same company and is very similar to, yet completely different than that game. Both are strangely addictive and ultra-fun to play. I can’t really explain why I love these 2 games other than it’s fast paced, non-stop action and you get smash peoples perfect little villages and cities and steal all their money. But, they get to do that to you too- so watch out!","Fast paced, addictive!"
4,2023-10-10 21:43:28,I absolutely love this game but monopoly you got to change something. Your tournaments end during school hours around the whole entire world so during the week days tons and tons of people don’t stand a chance in the tournaments because the bots or people will just pass them when they can’t do anything. So I am writing this hoping that you will see this and make a change so that the game is fair for everyone and more fun.,Tournaments
2,2023-10-01 06:42:18,"Although it’s a tad bit fun to advance, it’s constantly trying to get your money. They don’t give you a significant amount of dice when you do reach milestones, there is no real competition and when you do get a lil bit of lead way they draggggg it to the point you just get annoyed. You barely can get the cards you need and after awhile it just seems redundant. I just wanted something fun to pass time and enjoy, when I first downloaded I did have fun I even spent money. Just not worth it anymore fr. And a hour for dice is so ridiculous.",It’s getting progressively boring
3,2023-09-28 18:07:54,It’s a fun game. The interaction between friends is wonderful. However y’all need to come up with a strategy on these gold stickers. We can’t trade them but can get multiple duplicates. Not fair at all. Today is the worst day of all playing this game. No one can get into the game. However we can get notified of people attacking our property and when our dice is refilled. Also the meter does not work for when you add new friends cause I have not gotten any rewards for it nor have I seen the meter move period.,Monopoly Go
3,2023-09-28 17:04:52,"The game is fun due to the fact I can play with family and friends! However there’s a few glitches such as no internet connection for hours so you missing time to collect things you need to finish the boards. I also believe when you level up boards it should go up on the rolls, stop giving just 50 rolls switch it up! Other than that it’s an okay game! Just come with more cause I’m sure we all swipe every now and then to get rolls give more so more people will play!",Pros and Cons
3,2023-09-21 15:06:32,"I rate this a solid 3 for 1 reason. Unless you plan on spending money for rolls be prepared to wait time to play. Sometimes you roll 2000 rolls and it barely pays out. What I mean about that, is in the events you need a certain amount of space lands in order to get rewards. Sometimes it requires you to roll 1500 dice to get a 180 dice reward. It’s sort of hard to get stocked up on dice unless you spend money. But it’s a really fun game just annoying that you can’t participate in events because you have no rolls left.",Problem
5,2023-08-27 01:46:14,"This game is awesome. It would be nice if we could by dice with some of the money we make on the game, and even trade gold stickers at least for 1 special day. But overall it’s great. I got my whole family playing and and it’s even become a challenge almost us. Thanks for making it interesting and fun. I really enjoy the little games within Monopoly GO like the cakes and the cars we got to build. A++++",Love it
4,2023-09-16 21:43:07,"I shouldn’t have to spend 8000 dice just to be rewarded with 1200.  Make the prize reflect what the player is doing.  Same as with the cards.  If I am trading, I shouldn’t get back what I’ve traded.   It shouldn’t be so hard to earn rewards and in the mini games, I shouldn’t be penalized by someone not doing their share.  So maybe not have to join up with someone to do mini games, and earning points/tokens should be a little bit easier.",Ways to improve
2,2023-09-15 02:44:04,App has a lot of bugs. Screen goes black sometimes. Game is fun when it works. I can’t search a person who keeps attacking me every time I build something. Must be another issue or bug. When you get to higher levels the buildings cost way to much. That’s when this person starts attacking my buildings again no idea how because she’s not a friend of mine n I can’t go back at her more than one time. So fix the bugs and issues of not being able to search someone who’s attacked people more than one time not being friends.,Fix the issues
2,2023-09-14 23:41:43,"The game is literally the same from level 1 to 10,000. Rolling dice gets boring, they should make it more interesting, trading gold cards, sending dice to players, Buying cards with monopoly money. There should be an advantage when you're a higher level. The game should have more things to do. A lot of people quit after a while, its literally the same routine in the game, there is no advantage when you go higher in level besides seeing a higher level number and a different city to build but the same concept for every single level.",Needs more
1,2023-09-12 04:18:57,"At this point I think we need to go on strike with Monopoly cause it’s tripping and glitching and cheating us and charging ridiculous prices for these darn packs…. Customer support only wants to give ya a few millions and 35 rolls😮‍💨😩… I mean we worked super hard to get to where we are…. The least they can do is not be stingy with the dice rolls and the amount of dice they giving to complete the album…. And they need to make it to where you can share the pieces on the partner game or something…. I can’t even complete a board now in a day and over 2 million followers and all they wanna reward is 25 🎲 what about 250 or 2,500 🎲🎲🎲🎲",Not fun anymore! It’s actually sad!
2,2023-09-05 20:07:48,"The last sticker event before this one I was 8 cards away from completing the album , all were gold stickers. I bought the missing sticker guaranteed pack & did not receive a sticker I was missing . I could have gotten 1 gold sticker and gotten 1,700 dice easily. I emailed support 2 different times & they just got back to me today .. the last sticker event is already over.. and they sent me 70 dice and 21,000,000 . This would be fine except the missing sticker pack was $20 for everything they sent me is only worth $10 so I still missed out on $10. Lesson learned",DO NOT SPEND YOUR REAL MONEY
5,2023-08-14 04:31:37,Pleaseeeee do more events like the car show event. I love this game in general but the event is so fun. We get to help our friends instead of rob them all the time lol and lots of dice for completing cars. 10/10. My only slightly negative issue is I wish the higher we get with boards the more dice you get for completing them. I’m at 66 which costs millions just for 1 landmark. So that would be awesome to have more dice as an reward,I love this new event
5,2023-07-10 16:09:40,"Good to see monopoly still has a impact in 2023. I wish we didn’t have to open the sticker packs so often, kinda slows the game down. Also, “baking partners” needs something to those who do most of the work. I’ve had plenty of partners who just let me do all the work and they receive the same benefits as myself.   Just little things that’s irritating but overall 9/10👏🏿","Overall, I Love it!"
4,2023-08-06 03:52:39,"I love this game. All my friends have it. The only complaint I have is the cost of the rolls. $100 for 3500 rolls? You have to have a multiplier on at least x20 to get any rewards from the game so that number runs out in less than an hour. Just wish the rolls were easier to come by especially when you reach around level 45. The landmarks get so expensive so without a high multiplier, you get hardly anywhere.",Game is amazing. Rolls are too expensive!!
3,2023-07-26 12:30:06,"I don’t like the stickers. They’re as useful as the Columbia House stamps would be now. It takes too long to collect them and you can only exchange them for a few dice, or even more stickers.   Worse, by the time you wait for the whole prize box or sticker pack to open and unload, you’re susceptible to someone breaking into your bank and stealing all or most of your cash. Why not have a quick prize collection alert—instead of a pop up—and we can open the prizes later?",Could Be Better
2,2023-07-25 19:35:02,"I loved playing this game in my spare time. Collecting cards, participating in the little challenges, everything. I had it connected to my Facebook account to save progress in case anything happened. Then one day POOF, everything gone and it put me back at the beginning. I had made a few purchases on my original account to get where I was at. I have contacted support on three different occasions and I keep getting the same message “someone will contact you in 24 hours”. I’m so mad and highly disappointed in customer service.",Liked then lost progress
4,2023-07-21 01:24:39,Shortening the amount of time it takes to get more rolls this will increase the amount of people who want to play the game more because waiting and hour for 5 rolls where as I have similar games that have less than a 30 minute wait time is ridiculous is there anyway we can shorten the wait time to 5 rolls every 20 minutes please and stop with all the pop ups one is enough,Great game but takes to long to get more play time
3,2023-07-10 20:56:10,"I have been playing for a minute now, and don’t have an issue getting dice and I loved the baking tournament, because you get to help a friend at the same time, but it seems to be an issue getting new cards for the albums. I played for 5 days in a row, and only got 1 new card and the trade in the game isn’t worth it because you trade lots of cards for 4 or 5 of the ones you already have.

4,2023-05-11 18:25:10,"This game is so much fun & is super addictive. It’s very similar to board kings, but so much more. I highly recommend it to all. There are many contests that help you gain money & rolls. I love a game that makes it just as easy & fun to play without needing to spend. I also like how if you would spend money, you get a lot for your for very little money.

3,2023-11-08 00:03:57,"The High Roller Bonus where it amps up your multiplier for a time period is stupid. It doesn’t give you the option to deny the bonus. I don’t like when I get that reward, because it takes away your big multiplier, if your rolls drop below a certain number, unlike when you’re on normal multiplier, and your rolls get lower, you still get to keep your multiplier.

1,2023-11-07 13:18:58,"This game is lots of fun and very addicting quick. However, I gave it a one star because of the sketchy behaviors of the game.

Then the game is filled with fake users created by the game itself that robs you to force you to feel pressured to actually pay for things out of desperation to advance.

1,2023-11-04 18:15:18,I’ve given this games MONTHS to improve and it’s only gotten worse! How can you roll 1600 dice and not land on anything profitable? The cards are a JOKE I don’t trade or even bother! I notice how they have the game rigged to make you lose! Even if spending money in my experience there’s still no way to win most of the bigger prizes! It’s all about them getting rich while you push a button and gain absolutely nothing not even the rewards! PATHETIC you all should be ashamed I won’t be playing any longer it’s never going to improve since they’re gaining or should I say stealing so much money from people!,Such a money grab it’s pathetic
2,2023-11-02 20:14:43,"I downloaded this app a little while ago and have recently deleted it. It’s not necessarily a bad app, it’s just SO REPETITIVE and quite honestly boring. I got it in the hopes that it would be a fun app where I could play monopoly with friends online while getting added features. However, all there seems to be to the app is going round and round on a board collecting different rewards. Even the so called “mini games” are literally just you picking one of three chest to open. This may be fun for some people, but not for me. Sorry, just one person’s opinion.",Boring!!
5,2023-10-07 14:23:39,Overall it’s really addicting and fun to play. I feel like the further you go up in boards on the map the higher the rewards should be.

I’ve had over 500 dice and had not got a single railroad the game literally would continue to go over it or stop before it! It keep having people bank heist me but I can’t seem to bank heist anyone else back. Now today just installed it again and it saying error and the game is not letting me disconnect my Facebook !

4,2023-10-22 02:58:39,I love that the multiplier will increase as you level up. I love that you can put it on auto play.

3,2023-10-08 11:53:58,This game is by far a reliever for me. However I feel you should give more dice to continue playing. I get it that you’re seeking money AT ALL COST. Don’t make it so hard to achieve dice when you have tournaments or grand prizes. That’s my only gripe with the game.   Also there should be more dice given after a Landmark is closed. Those little fifty dice does nothing. Reward people for playing the game daily with more dice as well.   I will have to delete this game and go back to Cookie Jam where you can play FREELY.,The Game Could Be Better

Especially if you’re using the multiplier.   The dice being refreshed every hour is also terrible. How are we supposed to compete in these tournaments if we have to wait alllllll day for 60,70,80 dice ?   As for the properties, they all look the same as the first 25 we go through when starting the game. Why is costing me almost $2 billion to upgrade map 112 when it looks like map 13. 😒   Then when you upgrade the world, we only get $32 million after spending billions to upgrade. Along with 50 dice. It’s unacceptable.   The whole game needs to be updated.",Money Hungry Game
2,2023-09-26 06:17:04,"I genuinely loved playing this game a month ago before they switched to the new sticker album. The developers significantly lowered the prizes for completing albums and made it more difficult to succeed, unless you spend a lot of money. They also have a lot of glitches in the game during special events where you don’t get credit for what you earn. Several friends have stopped playing this game due to these same issues. I understand they want to make money, but their greed took the fun out of the game.",Greedy developers- game used to be fun
1,2023-09-24 16:29:25,I am so sick of this game. I have contacted them through the game multiple times about missing rewards and they just say they are working on it. Update the app here’s a gift you won’t ever receive. The developers of this game are joke. You have to spend 1000s just do anything in the game. The rewards you get are jokes but then you don’t even get some of the rewards you earned. Like they need to fix it. They don’t give you the stickers you need etc. I will probably be deleting as I don’t really play anymore. I have kept it on my phone hoping they fix my rewards issue but they aren’t. And they won’t.,What a joke
1,2023-09-22 02:57:02,I enjoy playing games on my phone. Monopoly is a treasured family game we grew up on. I hate that the dice rolls are manipulated and not organic rolls. We’re forced to purchase dice to get rewards. Purchases shouldn’t be mandatory to progress at a rapid rate. I can’t even trade for stickers because I can’t get any stickers past 1-3 stars. I’m sitting on 7 or 8 sets that I can’t finish because I can’t get rewarded gold stickers.  During the cake challenge I would get land on cookies that didn’t get added to my total. I wrote into CS a few times to express this and got no response.  Do better Monopoly please reward us for playing your game loyally.,Monopoly game = real greed

Heavily weighted against progression making it almost impossible to make any ground.   - landing overwhelming less on spaces i need to make the slightest progress.  - wheel spin has been annihilated, you used to get lucky and get the occasional new card. Now? Useless, i have seen slews of posts showing no new cards and only landing on the lowest payouts, makes me not want to level up because I have nothing to look forward to.  - Community chest is completely unable to be fully opened or get a decent payout.  -tournaments are covered in bots? Or ranked poorly to where you can’t get in the top 10 by casually playing you HAVE to grind and still only just break the top 10.  -application will have players attack you against their will. This has been proven by many.  You guys had a good thing going here, It was fun. Why did you ruin it?",Not fun anymore.
5,2023-09-19 02:07:50,Game is fun and addictive. Even better when you have a good network of friends. Only downfall is whether pay or play more duplicates than stickers to complete books. And dice distribution not enough. As you increase levels which require a substantial increase in money getting the same 50 dice is not worth it. Levels completed increase then dice should increase.,Just stopping by

1,2023-09-08 02:02:20,"Since the new album, this game significantly reduced the amount of dice you can get from all aspects of the game. This includes dice from Facebook friends, reduced rewards for albums and reducing tournament rewards. Not to mention you only get 8 dice per hour. This game has slowly pushed the game to a pay to play style game. They even went as far as significantly reducing rewards for the wheel spins, roughly 90% of the time you will get the 2 star pack.

3,2023-08-29 23:27:25,Overall I really enjoy this game with family and friends. The only thing that I would suggest is working on the trading system for the stickers or maybe incorporating a more attainable way to win the stickers in order to complete the albums. Some of these trading groups are just so full of people and it can hard to keep up with and even get stickers your missing. I know it’s more about getting people to spend money it but some extra help would be nice.,Trading could be better
4,2023-08-27 23:46:45,This game is really fun. My whole family is playing it and everybody is addicted. It is a little frustrating how slow the rolls are to regenerate…. Have to wait all day to spend some rolls in a matter of minutes and the stickers…. The stickers are SO frustrating! I have gotten SO MANY GOLD repeats! Can’t seem to get new stickers very often at all anymore. I hope they let us trade some golds for a day or something bc I have WAY too many repeats.,Fun but frustrating.

No reason I should have 3 of the same gold card when there are plenty others I NEED & can only get from the packs! What is going on monopoly? I’m about ready to delete it! I’m so over trying and trying and being stuck in the same place as everyone else. And the groups on Facebook? You just get scammed by other people! Something needs done with trading also!!!

Even when I buy them it’s always repeat. I get new ones but to much time in between. Fix the issue with the cards I will give it 5 stars. The cards are a big deal. We send reviews.

3,2023-08-02 10:56:13,"This game is awesome only started playing for about 2-3  weeks ago, I absolutely love it but you need to give people the cards they are needing , it’s no reason that everyone needs the same card. Your trading group is getting worse, they are actually charging people money for the cards they need. You should really fix that like ASAP, it’s no reason half the world needs the Right At Home card  and that’s why I gave you 3 stars . Also you need to give more dice .",You need to give us the cards we need
5,2023-07-19 14:10:52,"Y’all should make it so that u can trade gold cards also, cause what’s the point of duplicate gold cards and u can’t trade them??  Also when u hit a different board not just the money should go up the dice should as well cause u run outta dice to fast an the sticker packs don’t come fast enough to get new stickers to close albums to get dice I understand the 8 every hour but that’s not enough dice",Gold Cards an dice
3,2023-07-24 18:46:19,Love the game but they def need to do some upgrades!  Why when completing a board do you only get 50 dice no matter what Level you are on?  Dice reward should get higher as you level up.  Wheel boost?  What the heck is the point… 15 or 5 dice?  What does that honestly do?  The stickers — also a waste.  I have not received a new sticker in over a week but I have so many Multiples of gold level stickers that can’t be traded.  And wait an hour for 7 dice?  At this point thinking of bagging it unless there is some changes.,Monopoly

Then when the rolls are out, you’re just waiting for new rolls to come in to play some more. Watching the money build and leveling up makes you want to play more.

The game is fun, keeps you entertained, and provides enough free content to maintain the user interested and wanting to level up.   I wouldn’t mind drop money on this game for extra spins. Seems like the developers keep it competitive and the graphics are exceptional.  Keeps me coming back for more spins and content.",None pushy play time to buy game.
2,2023-06-05 03:38:47,I was disappointed. It's nothing like the board game. It's fun but just like not. It's like piggy go which is an amazing game. I recommend piggy go not monopoly go because I feel like piggy go is so much better and fun. These are my opinions so yours might be different. I love piggy go. I've played it since little so now I'm one of the richest players. This game is a total rip off of Piggy go. It’s also NOTHING like the actual board game. It would be more fun if we were was actually playing the game against people in line. That would make it a lot better and not such a rip off. Thx for reading. 🤩,Fun but disappointing
4,2023-11-01 16:44:46,"If only the game was less dependent on relying on others to complete task to gain prizes. Lastly, and most importantly, the fact the we cannot trade golden pictures in albums and having to rely on social media to complete albums. I personally don’t have social media and it limits me to completing albums, which is a huge bummer. Make alternative ways to be able to complete albums for those who don’t have social media.",Would be 5 stars if….
3,2023-11-02 17:21:54,"This game is great for testing self-control on impulse spending. It’s fun to try and see how far I can get w/o spending any money.   Stickers are a total sham/scam - I’ve got the same stickers for over a month now. It’s clear that in order to get the rest and complete the album, I’d have to buy a pack that guarantees 1 new sticker. That’s annoying and disingenuous on the devs part, but ultimately it’s just a game and doesn’t matter.   Pro-tips:  -Always spend all your money, try to leave as little in the bank as possible before closing the app. -It’s ok, even beneficial, to leave your shields empty. It’s an easy and cheap way to get blue tokens for upgrades. -You don’t have to use all your dice at once -  they can’t be stolen.

3,2023-10-27 03:17:24,I like the game but there are things that can be better such as the pop ups there’s TOO MANY also a pop up every time I run out of rolls it’s annoying. Also the amount of rolls you get every time you go up a level should go up at least 10 rolls each time because I’m on level 150 & still get 50 rolls even though everything else goes up it shouldn’t be as hard as it is to get all the cards you need I’m not gonna spend money just to get the ones I need.,Ehh.
2,2023-10-30 01:33:28,"This game was once really a lot of fun to play, spinning dice upgrading boards doing partner events it was awesome.  Then we saw the true greedy money hungry scopely come out and they made it harder for you to play the game by increasing the overall cost of everything in game and I’m not sure what’s worse, the fact that they charge you 100 dollars for not even 5 thousand dice, maybe 2 5 star cards and a couple of in game dollars which is never even enough to upgrade a board.  It’s truly sad that filling their wallets became more important than creating a quality game",Used to be great
5,2023-10-26 18:31:33,It’s really sad how much you guys charge and to top it off why we cannot use the money we win to buy dice. I’m quitting this game. You already have to wait an hr for 8 dice. That’s not right. Full of scams. If you want to win you have to spend almost $100 a day. No way and then you cannot even get the cards you need after two weeks of playing. I’m done!!!!

Almost immediately after the clock starts, the first 1-8 players have 80,000 or more pieces towards ranking. Even when I’ve spent $200 daily on rolls, Ive never been above 2000.

There should be a way to remove the partner that does not contribute anything or contributed very little. It’s discouraging to contribute 20K pieces and your partner contributes nothing & there’s nothing to do about it.",I love this game but there’s one thing I wish would change
5,2023-09-11 03:47:32,I love the game helps me pass time during the day and gives my brain a break but I wished we could 1. Donate dice or the cookies that we aren’t using when we finish these cakes to help someone else. 2. There def should be more than a 5 card trade limit  .  Also you should be able to fire partners who aren't helping lol. But idk just my opinion.,Love the game but could do with some changes.

Now, I pay for a bundle and finish a tournament “ranked up” on all gifts, to finish 2nd place but not get my dice for rank up just for second place.

I’ve been playing the game for a few weeks, I’ve spent money on dice to open additional sticker packs and not one new card. This is extremely annoying.  All of the bugs and lags have caused me to lose dice and rewards. To be honest, Im already getting bored of the game and close to deleting. I’ve just been hesitant because I keep hoping Scopely will do some updates and things will get better.","Fun game, too many issues"
3,2023-09-28 17:10:05,This game is overall fun but very buggy at times it’s will crash after doing a shutdown or heist sometimes. The plus I still get the money or prizes but to have to wait to get back in is a bit annoying. Opening the game takes a while to load even when connected to Wi-Fi. I used to play this game daily just to pass some time but with all this going on it’s taken the fun out of wanting to play everyday. Hopefully things get fixed soon.,Been very buggy lately
2,2023-09-26 19:24:10,I’ve dealt with the repeated cards in every pack with few (very very few) new cards popping up and the random freezes and glitches without complaint but after this last freeze took the 500 dice I won and customer service decided that a few million in fake money and 70 dice was an acceptable substitute (it was not acceptable) I’ve lost interest in this game and am telling everyone about my experience. I have games on my phone I’ve played for years and spent money on but this game will not be one of them. Player beware.,Not as much of a fan

You are required gold cards, unable to trade or gift gold cards yet you’re able to win the same gold card repeatedly. It makes them useless and pointless.  Rewards are often useless and aimed at getting you to use up your dice quickly. Even when you reach level 250+ you still only receive a small amount of dice per hour.  The game glitches often and you are not compensated. If you write into them regarding the issue… it takes multiple days to hear back and it is a robot generated response that doesn’t even address your issues.   The game can be fun but it borders on a scam. So I do not suggest spending money.  They have several issues they need to address and correct.

However I think that adding a bit of intelligent choice would go a long way in making this more interesting. I feel like my brain's just mushing into pudding while watching all this chance. In the original board game there was strategy and choices had to be made. Everything is just a random chance in this game making it pretty one dimensional. Everything that is of course for the decision to spend real money on it lol. To be fair you can choose your multiplier but that’s not much.   Think about building some choices into the game.

Every sticker set has a gold card and as soon as I unlock one gold card, all I unlock is duplicates maybe 6 times in a row. Then when I unlocked a new gold card, the same thing.

4,2023-09-08 10:40:49,The game is awesome however i think there should be a community chat that u can message what stuckers you need to trade in the game rather then on facebook.

Lack of dice for albums and 2500 for the purple vault  and more gold cards for each album is trash and makes this game less fun and unrealistic unless you spend thousands of dollars. Customer service is horrible and when people scam you of your cards the customer service sends you if even 70 dice and monopoly money. You can send proof and that’s all they will do for you. Customer service does not take care of concerns or needs so I will no longer play.,No dice and Customer service
4,2023-09-16 21:52:03,I just want to review this game so you know how frustrated people are getting at the changes youve made. Less dice available. Harder decks to complete. Made trading nearly impossible. People are hoarding their cards to trade for 5-star cards that no one else has bc they haven’t got even one 4-star dupe. I’m not sure how many people might eventually leave this game over this crap. I play every day and love it but I’m getting sick of it quick.,Getting sucky
4,2023-09-06 08:55:48,I love the game but it gets frustrating when it’s seems progress is being limited or at a standstill when you are on higher levels. I’m not saying make real easy but realistic because everyone doesn’t have money to buy dice. And 8 dice every hour is crazy. I would like to be able to buy any color stickers pack only as an option. Also the game glitches and freezes a lot. Thanks,Fix it please
2,2023-09-03 16:01:07,"Monopoly go was fun for a while. I would like to know how much people have spent on this game to get the stickers? Once I stopped buying stickers I never got any new ones. There was no was to reach the sticker goals without spending hundreds of dollars. Please give actual dollar amounts of how much it costs to achieve the full reward.  I was at level 79 but realized I was never going to win without going into a financial commitment, I lost interest and realized I was gambling and not playing Monopoly.  Good concept but going round and round gets old and expensive. I",Round and round you go

It's very discouraging to see all the newly added features, which will likely make it even more difficult to complete the entire album. One gold card in every set, less rewards when you do complete a set, 2500 stars to open the pink vault now, and I'm sure there are other features I haven't come across yet. Idk if this was a good move on your part, a lot of people are deleting the game. And I'm considering doing the same myself. Super disappointing.",money grab.

They’re people who’s started way after me and have finished before me.. The Game ALWAYS give duplicate Gold cards knowing we can’t trade those in or to others in the Monopoly community world. If they did better with the events ( only landing in the corners ) and having a better algorithm about knowing which card was needed.",The Game Should Know When We Only Need Gold Cards Left
5,2023-08-14 13:00:35,The game is super fun overall but after a while it just repeats itself over and over again and if you use all your dice then you’ll have to wait an hour and keep the app open and I don’t really want to sit around wasting my battery for dice. Although it’s a really thought out game it could be better and all but that’s just my personal opinion.,It’s alright
4,2023-08-16 21:42:25,"In a future update, add some coding into the game to allow the gold stickers tradable. I know I’m not the only player that wants this. We have multiple copies of golden stickers that can not be used due to not being able to trade. Please and thank-you. Also, it would be nice to have an option for players to turn the animations off, if they don’t want them on.",Make gold stickers tradable and have an option to turn animations off.

Some ideas that could make it even better would be to have baking partners more frequently like maybe “building a sandcastle” or “carving a pumpkin”. I also was disappointed when I got to map 100 that there wasn’t a reward for reaching 100. Overall love the game though!",Absolutely love! Some things can be better
4,2023-08-11 17:46:38,I can’t give five stars cause the game likes to glitch and skip what it should land on. We get gold cards as dupes but can’t trade them. Then it’s just a repeat of stickers instead of what you need. When doing tournaments the game won’t really let you land on the stuff you need. And they could keep those gray sticker packs cause no one need them. Like I want to keep enjoying the game but it shouldn’t be hard to get the things you need.,Love it and hate it

I suggest that y’all give new cards each time a purchase with “ real “ money is used!! “ .. 50 rolls per stage completion is horrible .. and how we get the same duplicate gold card but can’t send .. smh and we should be able to send rolls to friends.. this game took my money I need a refund .. can’t even complete a album set without having to beg Jesus for a merry Cassowary, right at home , or a pickpocket .. but y’all wanna give me 5 gold card if the same card when I bet 50x or 100x ..",Horrible game
1,2023-08-07 13:22:09,I love this game however… it’s very annoying that you have to wait almost a full day just to get 70 dice that last you literally two minutes to use. Once you get the dice you make everything to much to get the free gifts your out of the dice before you know it! it is very exciting when you have the chance to get stickers but it’s never any new ones that you need!   It seems like all they want is money to buy dice and stickers. There’s always 3 or more pop ups asking for money to get rewards.. all I want to do it get on the game waste some time have fun and not spend money!,Problems with monopoly go
4,2023-08-05 13:15:59,"I’m only on level 8, but I did notice that whenever I’m rolling the dice, I get so many shields. But it’s like as soon as someone attacks my landmark I only have 3 shields left of protection??? What’s the point in landing on a million shields if 4 is the max you can technically have. I also don’t like that it takes an hour to get more rolls and then they only give you 5. As I progress in the game we’ll see what else I notice, other than that I enjoy the game.",Pretty good game
1,2023-08-04 04:50:09,"At first I enjoyed the game. However, it’s been nearly 3 weeks since I’ve received a card I actually need! It’s become a joke at this point. People are scamming other players out of cards and even charging for cards. Is it so hard to let people win cards they actually need? I will be recruiting others to leave the same review on this app. The only cards left that I need are 5 stars, so why are you giving me 1 and 2 stars?!?! And why give duplicates of gold cards? YOU CAN’T EVEN TRADE THEM! At this point I am convinced that the creator of this game has a Napoleon complex and uses the game to get revenge on his bullies. RANT OVER, FIX THE GAME.",Duplicate Cards

3,2023-07-28 12:15:52,This is a really fun game but don’t count on customer service     When the last major issue happened I lost so many rolls that weren’t replaced because the game kept resetting.   Only received 150 rolls as a sorry  Well now the game glitched again and took one of the new cards I needed    I messaged customer service and gave them screenshots and all proof and I was told ….didn’t happen and no one ever got back to me or helped me so if you loose something in the game don’t count on getting it back,Love the game but….
3,2023-07-20 12:28:11,"I like monopoly and have lots of memories playing with my family when I was younger, and monopoly go can be alright, but they constantly push buying rolls and cash in your face and it takes forever to gain more rolls otherwise. The only way you get more is by buying them or waiting, when you are out there are no ways to get anymore otherwise. The ways you can get more rolls like the time limited contests, you get people buying a ton of rolls to keep ahead so that sides broken too. So yeah, it fun, but eh.",Eh

1,2023-07-06 20:41:18,It started off okay but then started having issues. Couldn’t log on for a whole day and still glitchy today. Was supposed to get 150 free rolls because of the inconvenience but they cheated me out of that. Now there’s a glitch where all the challenges have disappeared and we’re not being credited for completing task. As someone who spends actual money in this game I’m disgusted and disappointed. We’re not being credited enough for the loss of time and for some of us the waste of our money!!! Please fix this and MAYBE I’ll give a 5 star rating. AND WHEN ITS FIXED WE DESERVE MORE THAN A LOUSY 150 FREE ROLLS and that’s IF y’all give us anything!!,WHATS GOING ON!?

4,2023-06-05 06:46:22,"Really liking this app. It’s fun, it’s clean, it’s unique.  I understand there’s no ads but I wish they gave us some more dice to roll without feeling the grind so hard.   Also. I don’t have have Facebook and it seems to be very tied down to their ecosystem.  Can we have some more features to interact with friends we make from the app? Also can we change our picture without having a Facebook?",Fun. No ads. Fresh feel to mobile space
3,2023-11-05 16:06:42,"The game is adequate for something you hop on for a little bit, use your dice, then hop off. It’s not a huge time sink. It’s easy to pick up, and there are frequent events to give you rewards. There is also some decent variability in the events. But there’s just so many pop ups trying to sell you stuff! And the rewards they give you are just enough to keep you interested, but not enough that you will win anything huge without payment.",So many pop ups

On the last album, by this point I had almost every card, this time it’s almost impossible. I’m barely halfway and it ends in a month.  Plus, the new update is extremely glitchy. I can’t do anything.

I’ve had twice I passed a milestone in a tournament and the prize box didn’t open or credit the fill bar just kept going past it. The price for dice is ridiculous and when you win sticker packs it 1-2 star duplicates. The gold trading event is a joke. One card no one needs and the other one as rare nobody has.

The new Epic Myths album drastically reduces the odds of getting rare stickers due to the gold card pack changes and number of gold cards in the album. This wouldn’t be much of an issue had they not implemented a genius system of bots that run up the score for the tournaments which are conveniently the ONLY place you can earn five star gold sticker packs.

Sometimes I’ll play 20x or 50x and win shields yet overnight I wake up and all of my shields are gone. That makes no sense.   Leaving 3 stars because the game developers knew what they were doing by purposely placing the payment option directly on the Monopoly GO button.   Most people are iPhone users and If you’re clicking really fast, you can click X amount after you run out of dice and then Face ID will charge you. I don’t like this.

Also, sometimes when I load into the game, I can not press anything on the game or even open anything at all. It has a few bugs that needs to be fixed but other than that, the game is AWESOME!",Why I rated a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,2023-11-01 17:36:28,"When I opened my app I was missing my steering wheels that I was too tired last night to use over 800, when I was going to finish my last car I had no wheels. AND I can’t finish my buildings because it says that an error has occurred and it needs to restart ….. WHY?!?! Please fix it reopens with one building started so I’m getting hit loosing shields and getting frustrated.",Help
1,2023-11-01 23:38:23,"SOOO many bugs and issues all the time. they make it impossible to finish certain tournaments or activities without spending money. their game glitches out causing me to not be able to play costing me 600 million dollars and i lost it all because i couldn’t even load up the game. in the couple months i’ve had this game it’s been issues upon issues. i would NEVER recommend this game to anyone. spend hours working your money in the game up just for bugs to happen and everything is gone and then guess what, you email support and they never respond. PERFECT!",waste of time
5,2023-11-01 16:59:29,Error message keeps popping up and starting over. We need more free dice than what you guys are giving out or we can’t play. 7 dice every hour is crazy I use that within 2 minutes. We get the same stickers over and over. Boards cost a arm and leg to buy and level up. I like the game just can’t play as much as I would like because DICE!,Unhappy
5,2023-09-20 02:00:22,I hated the board game as a kid and it was mediocre as an adult. Then I tried the monopoly cards from Walmart. I ended up LOVING it from those. I tried this game and it’s even better than the cards. I just hate when either the game or my phone starts me over to the beginning for some weird reason. It frustrates me me losing all my money lol. I gain it back but I would like to level up quicker lol.,The best game ever!
1,2023-10-29 10:57:51,I get the people that developed the game wants to make a profit but if that was the case then this should of been a paid game and not a free game. This is game is all about making money. When I first downloaded the game it was free and very addictive but I think it was worth it. But I guess once the developers seen how much interest the game got they came up with a hyper capitalist plan to squeeze money out of the players by any means necessary. I can’t land on the boards that I need the most. We don’t get no new stickers. I can’t complete sets because I need gold stickers in which they can’t be traded. Make it make sense!!,The game is rigged
2,2023-10-13 06:12:39,Stop giving us the same sticker 20+ times even when trading 500 stars for a chest and you still give the same stickers we already have this is why I’m barely playing anymore you guys ruined the fun in this and within one update do better nobody’s gonna waste money if you’re ruining people’s fun even playing the game the competitions only give slight hope you might get good prizes but other then that y’all tanked and fast probably gonna delete it soon if you won’t fix the issue it’s becoming pointless 😅,The stickers man
2,2023-10-08 15:45:03,The creators made this game impossible to beat without spending real money which I think is beyond ridiculous. I spent a lot of money trying to keep getting dice to finish tournaments all for me to not get anything. A GAME should never require someone to spend real money just to play a game. If you don’t spend money then you have to wait an HOUR TO GET 8 DICE which is pathetic. Y’all don’t make it easy to enjoy the game. Paying for sticker packs only to get duplicates. This is highway robbery and the creators should be ashamed. Have some decency,Not consumer friendly
1,2023-09-28 15:23:04,"I’ve had this app for a couple of months now and it helped pass the time. Today when I tried loading  app it was taking extremely long and eventually told me that there was no internet. I tried this with and without wifi. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app. Idk what’s going on but the game isn’t loading for me anymore and I’m able to open my other apps without issue so I know it’s not my phone. Besides the fact that you have to pay to play and actually advance in the game, this is the most frustrating problem yet. Please FIX",App won’t open anymore
3,2023-09-20 19:42:10,"It was fun before the new card album came out. Now it’s rigged to try to get people to spend money. Every event I land on the tiles around what I need, and when that event changes, it changes the where I land. That way I don’t hit them as well. You can tell it’s not random at all. They programmed it to do that. If you wanna spend $100’s of dollars each month I bet it would be fun. Just goes to show you that they don’t care about people enjoying the game, they just want the money",This game is rigged
5,2023-09-13 00:40:06,"This game isn’t actually free. You get a good 10 minutes at first; but by week 3 of playing it, you don’t have enough dice to last you 10 seconds.  Once you need to land on a certain tile to complete an event, all of a sudden you don’t land there as frequently. Meaning you need to buy more dice in order to complete the challenge.   Should give 0 stars",Run out of dice too fast
4,2023-09-17 03:45:20,The game is addictive but once you reach the higher levels it gets frustrating. They are stingy with the dice and gold stickers and they give you the same stickers over and over again even when you pay for them. 50 dice after you finish a board is okay in the beginning but for higher levels 50 dice gets you no where because the landmarks cost more to build.,Fix it
2,2023-09-13 19:18:20,"While this game is fun to play, the amount of pop ups for sales this game prompts you with is unmatched. I counted when I opened today, and I got 7 pop ups that I had to close out of before I got to roll the dice. How desperate are these people for money? If I don’t buy 1 $5 offer, why would you make me deny 4 more just like it before I can play? Not to mention there’s even more pop ups when you run out of dice, or the multiplier you use is larger than the dice you have left. Reduce the pop ups to 1 or 2 per day and I’ll give it 5 stars",SO MANY POP-UPS!!!
5,2023-08-28 01:40:35,"I’ve been playing this game none stop lately. Still has some bugs though, sometimes you’ll roll and the multiplier won’t work and it’ll take your dice, it’s happened like 30+ times when I’m using a 3x and up multiple still great just give the devs some time to work out the kinks",Amazing(still has some bugs to be fixed)
1,2023-09-11 04:28:31,The game is initially fun to play but you can’t complete the challenges or complete card sets unless you are willing to spend your $$. The game often does not give all of a reward you land on or earn. The same goes for the number shown on the dice when you roll. Say you roll a 6. The game moves you 7 skipping over the ones you really need to land on.  I understand the motive to make money as it is what it is for BUT you can’t actually compete or get anywhere in the game unless you do.  It shows often how rigged it can be depending on the time your playing.,The game is obviously rigged. $$ grab
1,2023-09-04 03:35:13,When i first started this game it was somewhat fun and addicting. Overtime it got worst really fast. The fact that bank heists for hundreds of millions can happen to you from people not even in you friends list is ridiculous considering you can’t do them to strangers. The last sticker album was almost unattainable i was stuck with one card to get at the end for weeks. These new sticker packs with little to no chance at getting more than 1-2stars is ridiculous and makes me not want to play at all. This whole game is just a money grab for hasbro and scopely at this point. TRASH! Deleting.,Waste of time
1,2023-09-03 20:43:52,"Last week the app updated when a new Sticker Pack became available. This changed the economics of the game greatly. Causing users to not feel compelled to continue playing.    They made dice and money harder to come by with properties being more expensive. Stickers are harder to get and more rare now. All while having less time to collect them. New maps still provide the same fifty dice and money. And the safes are more expense now to exchange duplicate cards.   The only positive thing they did was smooth the fluidity. The app runs great now, but the game is no longer fun or fruitful to play.",Recent Change in Game
5,2023-08-09 16:26:15,"Game is awesome and addicting. One thing that should be updated is the trading system. Too many people getting scammed for the rare stickers and then getting blocked. Implement a finalized agreement option after both parties send their stickers to each other where they would need to accept the card that is shown the other user sent. Aside from that, game is addicting lol.",Great game.
2,2023-08-27 17:37:00,It was good at first but it’s hard to keep playing because you don’t get enough rolls. The tournaments and whatever else they have going doesn’t really help. It’s very little rolls you get. And then the stickers are too hard to complete. I joined those monopoly fb groups to trade and everyone is just scamming each other. Wanting others to “trade” and never sending the card you need or sending you completely different cards then agreed. Monopoly just keeps giving the same cards constantly smh. Hard to want to play still,Eh
3,2023-08-27 02:13:12,"The game is great but the stickers are wayyyyyyyy too repetitive to not get new ones to complete these sets. I get it’s random but if I’m getting these bigger sticker packs like the blue and purple/maroon ones, you’d think I would be getting at least one new sticker every now and again. Also, it would be nice if I had a choice between a shutdown or bank heist… I can choose whose board I want to shut down, why can’t I have a choice in how I retaliate if someone stole from my account via bank heist?",It’s good….but….
1,2023-08-14 12:28:52,"When you get close to the end of a album they make sure you don’t get any new stickers and cannot finish a challenge. If type meed to land on 4 corners the algorithm makes sure you don’t land there enough to ensure you get what you need and then when it changes to chance, community chest railroads, they also make sure you don’t get those either. I have also noticed that at the end of whatever challenge it is that you are trying to complete they put 1200 dice but you need 800 points to get them and they give you an hour to get them hahahah! I’d rather clip my toenails!! Game deleted.",Game is terribly rigged!!!
3,2023-08-13 20:44:57,I started playing this game because a few family members were playing.  Quickly became addicted.  To the point I even spent a little to get more dice.  But the stickers are ridiculous…I have over 10 of some and can’t get any of the others needed.  They even have a Facebook page where you can trade.  Good Luck with that one…just scammers..rarely does anyone get any help there.  You guys should be monitoring and kicking the scammers off!!  When I run out of dice this time I’m done.,Annoyed1000
5,2023-08-08 20:59:40,We should be able to see which cards our friends need so we can send em if we have em .. why is that not a option or on the cards be like so and so needs this card or click here to see which friends need this card ? Would make it a lot easier to share cards with friends to make up for destroying there stuff lol,Games good but be better if ….
4,2023-08-07 18:25:14,I love this game but when I open the app there are so many pop up deals for you to buy and you have to click the X 100 times!!! Everything takes so long to load you can’t juys click one thing after another you have to wait a few seconds for it to fully load. I wish there were more tokens. After you get so many cards you wouldn’t get loads more.,So many pop ups!!!
5,2023-07-27 18:28:57,"One of my friends tricked me into downloading this game. I actually thought it was another monopoly game, but he put the link on social media to play and I didn’t realize he needed people to join in order to open the community chest. Since then I have kept playing and playing and been hooked sense. It’s a really great game. I wish they gave us more dice but still an awesome game.",Tricked and loved it !
2,2023-07-30 14:54:39,"This game has so much potential, there is so much that could be added and adjusted to make this an extremely fun game that can last many years.   I really feel like the ‘waiting for rolls’ feature is going to make me stop playing, because the only other option is to buy rolls. Add an option to watch Ads, or increase the prizes for Free-To-Play events.   Speaking of Events, I feel like winning them is impossible when you have people that can just buy a bunch of Rolls and easily pass you on the leaderboard.   It’s sad because the concept is fantastic, but I think the developers are too money hungry to make it a better game. Remove this silly roll timer, give us ways to earn more (for free), and remove Pay-To-Play from Events to even the playing field.   If I stop playing in the next few days, this is why.

It took hours to load and when it did it made me start all the way over so disappointed! You already have to wait 59 minutes for 5 rolls. I worked hard to get to that level 😭😭😭I would give it 0 stars if I could. I hate starting over",Game crashed during update
4,2023-07-25 05:03:13,I love this game it’s so addicting! BUT it seems that it has a rhythm of picking the same things automatically like on the community chest or getting the same cards over and over and can barely get new ones I feel like something needs to be fixed to where it’s always a random pick and doesn’t land on the same spot on my community chest it either picks too left corner or top middle everytime,Just some feedback!
1,2023-07-21 13:30:21,"Just updated and “fixed the shiny bugs” did ya. No you did not, my game still constantly crashes and is very laggy and it not my service cause I have full bars  Edit- just uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still won’t even load up for me. I guess this is the last time I ever spend money on anything hasbro. Absolutely disappointed and disgusted with how y’all are literally making more money then people are spending on this game and y’all can’t use a little bit of that money to pay someone that actually knows what they are doing to fix everything y’all messed up.",Crashing
4,2023-07-09 23:19:14,"I have played this game for the memories I had as a kid, the original monopoly game. This is the only reason I chose to play. I know in this day and the age, I expected the gizmos and gadgets to have the game work, you can’t fix the problem’s with all your technology! What does that say about your technological advancement? It’s telling me technology is full of crap. You asked for it, here it is. Have a great day and allow us to have a good day, fix the problems!",Monopoly Go
5,2023-07-05 20:29:44,I downloaded this game from the testerup website. So I have been playing this game to earn money ($60) once I complete Lv 32 & I’m way passed that level as of today. I’m going to continue playing because it’s fun. I didn’t or don’t have to spend money as I been hitting too 5 in the leaderboard game that gives u dice. I also love the fact that a lot of FB friends are joining in and raving about the game,Loveee
5,2023-06-15 16:19:03,This game has barely any ads and is so fun. At first I thought I would be playing regular monopoly but it’s actually playing by yourself unless you play with the community box i think. Takes very long to get on bank heist or destroying spaces but I love how they have the dice multiplayers to improve how many prizes you get. Got this a few days ago and haven’t stopped playing it since.,Love It!!!
5,2023-05-23 11:23:33,"Because the game looks so much like the add unlike other games I play, it’s so realistic and cartoony and I like it. One downside is that I don’t like the way you can knock peoples stuff over because they put in so much work to get it fully made and then just get it knocked down but I like it a little bit. Overall the game is really fun and interesting and I recommend it!",Reason I give Five Star
5,2023-11-01 17:13:33,"I have lost so many wheels, money and time due to this restart error. This is a fun game when it works but this glitch is beyond crazy.

Signed a huge fan that may not be a fan anymore!",This is the worst glitch since I’ve had this game!
3,2023-05-12 10:29:46,"I honestly kind of like the game. I like the auto featured where it can just go with occasional doing things (like idle games).    My three biggest hang up are the rapid fire events, loss of events, and so many pop ups. The events are usually only a day, so you can get very little done. I started the game on PEG-E, and PLEASE make him a permeant feature. It was encouraging to get tokens and use them. Also, the pop up ads are just ridiculous.   I genuinely think the game would be at least a star better with less intrusive pop up ads (trust me, I know I can buy things, and I am a lot more likely if you don’t shove it in my face every 5 seconds).   PEG-E returning as a permeant feature and just getting tokens as you do the rent payments and event progress would make it a 5/5 stars, immediately. Please bring him back.",Better than Expected
3,2023-11-10 20:45:13,"The game is lovely but something that I hate about it is that whenever you get on the game to play the first thing you see is ads to buy things to help you get further in the game. This really gets on my nerves because all I wanna do is play the game, but I have to wait for all the ads to go away to finally play the game. This is something that I kindly ask yall to fix I don’t mind the ads on the side of the screen just the ones when you get on the game to play.",Ads

I purchased dice on the estate profit sale site. It froze, it did not progress to the free stickers  nor would it allow me to access the free dice without the stickers. They both remain locked. In fact  the entire game is locked on that screen and I cannot close it. KLewis",Frozen board
1,2023-11-03 02:08:19,"Completely disappointed that the game is designed for a regular player to not complete the full sticker albums in a 90 day period. I play daily and so does my daughter. At this rate we will not complete the current sticker album and it just truly does not make sense. There are so many duplicates, you cannot trade all the cards, you are limited in how much you trade. The rewards during tournaments do not even help. I went weeks without a new sticker while playing daily. This company can profit while still allowing players to complete these albums.",Fun but frustrating
5,2023-11-01 16:02:39,I have spent a lot of money on this game and the rewards are not worth the payouts. They are going to have to fix that issue or myself and many others will spend our money elsewhere.  My game is having to reset every few minutes costing me time on finishing the car.

Also, you’ll never win the tournament 1, because the game rarely gives you new stickers 2, all the Facebook groups aren’t the same anymore everyone is scamming people out of stickers or making them pay actual cash then scamming them.

I thought I was crazy till I asked other friends if they had the issue and they said they did when they updated their land mark and never received the dice for it.

5,2023-09-11 13:37:53,I think it’s so stupid how we run of dice but then you ppl who make the app allow ppl to jus knock down all ur buildings. It should only b allowed to know down all ur shelf’s and 3 properties 2 times not all the way to the seton. It’s hard building up over a billion dollars to level up an have it all taken away is jus crazy. I’m on the verge of deleting the game and soo many ppl r feeling the same,Crazy
1,2023-09-27 13:46:15,Dont waste your time. This game is ridiculous and very time consuming. Whoever wrote this sure doesnt play it. It's almost impossible to get dice and the further you get the harder everything gets. Oh and the sticker collection thats a joke. The first round was impossible to complete without literally begging people for trades then monopoly decides to make the second round even more difficult. Why woudl someone have over 2000 duplicates that cant even complete a set. I will be deleting along with a lot of others that have already. Maybe I can save someone the sanity. If not go for it,Dont do it
1,2023-09-20 16:35:34,"You get to a certain level of the game when it because pointless to play unless you spend a lot of money for barely any dice. You cap it at 80 dice total and 8 dice every hour. It’s impossible to play with just 80 dice. Also, the stickers are harder to get now, especially to finish sets to complete the challenge. You are making it impossible for people to enjoy and play the game. Maybe work on changing some of those things before you find people not playing. With these current issues, I would not recommend this game to anyone.",Reached a level where it’s unplayable
5,2023-09-08 16:11:00,"Everything about this game is addicting. Fun to play! And cant stop playing. However i feel like once u get max shield it should switch out to dice because u only are able to equip four  After that its pointless because its not like it stacks. That’s my only suggestion once u get max shields, shields should get replaced with dice on the board until your short on shields",Great Game !
1,2023-09-10 00:05:16,This is a terrible game and it just a stupid boring way of playing monopoly. Almost everything in Monopoly Go is in Board Kings so that proves they copied board Kings. The new boards the stickers the bank heist the roll multiplier. That is literally everything. Board Kings is a lot better and is cuter. Yes board kings is just another board game like game it is cute like how it has little bunnies and new themes per board (I love the boot camp board). I think everyone should delete this game and show support to the board kings creators because they are the victim of monopoly go copying them. Thank you and this game is now deleted. Bye bye.,This is a straight up knock off of Board Kings
1,2023-09-09 01:32:55,Unless you have billions of free dollars laying around then this a game isn’t for you. Last board was fun and easy to get a few cards but them gold cards are hectic to get. I witnessed people spend 100 of dollars only to not complete the set. The algorithm for this game is rigged. It take 10 hours to get your dice fully loaded. Plus trying to receive rewards is tricky because they make sure you don’t land on the tiles need to win rewards. You have to lose majority of your dice to win new dices.   On top of not taking accountability they are fueling their reviews with bots to keep their ratings high. This game is a literal joke now 🫠,Dice
5,2023-08-27 00:09:49,"Love the game. I’m addicted. I would like more inside knowledge on the STICKERS.  At first it was fun, but this last week it became real. Lol.

2,2023-09-04 06:04:02,"Playing this game reminded me so much of a game I used to be obsessed with years ago, Board Kings. It’s basically an exact copy of the game, just Monopoly branded. It copied the money stealing and the cost to improve buildings, along with almost every other small detail you could think of. It’s a boring version of the game I used to love. It even inspired me to redownload Board Kings and start playing that instead. Two stars because I like the game concept, but they could have tried harder to not make it so obvious that they’re copying from Board Kings.",Worse Version of Board Kings
1,2023-08-31 19:55:08,"This game although it’s fun to play, it cheats. When you roll the dice it picks where it wants you to land. Also the sticker packs, it’s almost impossible to finish most of the sets unless you beg other people for their extra cards or make multiple accounts to trade with yourself. Not all of the cards are even eligible to trade so good luck finding those gold cards. The only way you might get lucky is if you find someone in an online group who can help you. I haven’t spent any money on the game but I do know other people have spent money only to still not get what they need.",More like Monopoly Don’t Go
4,2023-08-30 03:55:16,"This game is super good!! I love love love this game, but I have a few complaints. I don’t like how you get extra gold cards but cannot trade then at all?!?! I also don’t like how each level you gain you still only get 50 dice even up to 127 (the level I’m currently on)  There should be a way to watch ads for dice in my opinion, because not everyone has money to buy them….  Other than that, I really do enjoy the game!!!",It’s very addicting
5,2023-08-19 18:40:55,I love the game I play it every day and am literally waiting to get rolls 😂 but I see people get scammed for stickers every day. Giving stickers then the person just takes them and doesn’t trade back. I feel like we should have it kind of like a trade in Pokémon Go. Both parties have to put up the stickers and hit accept before it’ll trade so we can stop scammers.,I love the game BUT I have an idea
3,2023-08-23 11:00:33,When you gain rewards from whatever is going on in the game and someone that isn’t even your friend can bank heist you for all of your money and it destroys your buildings that you have to pay to fix. I am not seeing how that is fair at all!! That right there just made me quit this game. I’m done. It’s bull crap and I didn’t work that hard in the game to come that far for a stranger to mega bank heist me and take every dime and my buildings. Please explain to me how that is fair at all!?,It’s definitely rigged
3,2023-08-22 06:00:33,"I wanna give this game 5 ⭐️ but it’s a few things UNFAIR about this game. The fact you get to HIGHER levels and upon completing the board you get more money than dice. I’m on level 106 and I just got 50 dice🤔🫤. Then with the stickers once you only need 1 sticker to complete a set and finish the sticker board THEY REFUSE TO GIVE STICKERS YOU NEED, there’s no way I’m on level 106 and I’ve gotten HUNDREDS of stickers but repeatedly the ones I already have, or don’t need.

1,2023-08-21 00:46:48,"The amount of money I have spent on this game is ridiculous and shame on me for doing so. I need 2 gold stickers to finish the entire set. I’m level 6910 and I’ve seen people with level 5000 finish the set and starting to finish it a second time. If I don’t finish the set by the end I will completely delete my profile, and I will never spend another dollar on it. The fact that you can’t even trade gold cards is ridiculous as well. The game was fun when you were able to complete sets and level up but after awhile they just don’t want to give you anything. 1/10",Money grab
5,2023-08-15 16:24:17,The game cool but y’all need to fix it why when I have all my shields they can still take my money or knock my board .. it should be consequences for them when they can’t take over my board send them to jail or something there’s no way I wake up or leave my board for 5/10 mins & all my money gone billions 🙄 it’s not making sense I’m sure ppl can agree!!!,Fix it asap…

If you want to do a trade both people put their traded cards in & once they are in, the trade is completed. Right now there are just too many people saying they will make trades & then they don’t do it & you’re out a card. I got scammed for a 4 star card earlier today.",Fun!
3,2023-07-26 14:27:55,this game is fun and all but literally every time I open the game I get at least 4 back to back to back pop up notifications about packs I can buy. Like I didn’t even click anything yet. Makes me want to close the game instantly. and you’ll ALWAYS get three pop ups back to back once you’re out of dice. Every single time. And the animations? Too long and unskipable  So yeah. Fun game but annoying with trying to get your money. So annoying that I will never spend a penny out of spite.,WAY TOO MANY POPUPS
4,2023-07-24 01:30:04,"It’s worth it ! But, the game needs to give more rolls. Even if you purchase rolls during their events it’s still not enough. Not to mention 7 rolls every hour … yeah ! More money you spend more rolls no matter the level or properties you have. Events such as the baking and the robot/ tokens were cool events that should be weekly as much players they have. Other than that the game is fun and interesting. Just needs a few adjustments.",Update Game

1,2023-10-31 14:49:23,"While the game was fun at first, there are SO many issues. It will glitch constantly and you will lose progress. There are tones of bots who will repeatedly attack your boards and fill the leader boards in events making it impossible for you to have a chance to earn rewards. All of this is in an effort to force you to have to buy dice packs just to have a chance. The customer service is a joke! They never reply and if you are lucky enough to get a reply, they won’t help and just send you a few dice and tell you your problems are “user error”.",Don’t bother!
3,2023-10-31 11:29:09,"I love the game, however when it comes to these wheels and completely these cars the closer you get to the top prizes the weirder the game gets.

Another thing is I have over 1000 stickers and I never get new stickers and when traded in the stickers for the vault I receive the same stickers I just traded in and a little amount of dice. It’s honestly not worth it.",Good but annoying

1,2023-10-02 20:12:04,Game is fun to play will give them that but Once you get to the point where you start spending money on it be prepared to keep spending money on it!! Because it’s like they have it that way. Seem like once you get down to 100 dice it won’t land on anything that will help you out like chance/railroads. Also have had issues with my dices and prizes disappearing had to contact customer service several times before could even get a response. Then they had the nerve to only compensate me with 35 dices when I lost way more than that,Don’t spend any money on this game.

Not to mention the higher you level up, the more expensive the game packs become. There is also a sticker event going on where they really don’t give you much opportunity to find stickers you need unless you’re willing to join a Facebook group to trade which is also a hassle since people scam SO MUCH.

The fact we aren’t given the Stickers we need to finish albums so crazy instead we get duplicates for cards we can’t even trade to help others. PLUS it’s getting so out of hand that there are SCAMMERS on groups on Facebook to trade stickers asking for MONEY instead of helping one another is absolutely DISGUSTING.

That’s ridiculous especially for when you’re 2000 level and up.

Stickers are another issue. Way to many duplicates. Yes, you can join Monopoly GO on Facebook and trade, but most people will take from you and never give back.

I’ve invited a bunch of people from Facebook who join and in turn the number of people who join are supposed to stack up and give rewards. I get a 100 roll bonus when they initially join but none of them count for the other prize and it still reads 0/15 even though I’ve probably got 20+ people to join.

2,2023-10-21 08:58:39,"It’s not a bad game, but it’s not great either. It keeps you coming back, for better or worse. The biggest issue is that there just isn’t really any goal - just keep tapping the bright colors to see more bright colors. If you’re trying to complete the sticker collection, you’ll just get a bunch of duplicates. Maybe new stickers are paywalled, maybe they’re not. I’m sure not going to spend money to find out.  On the plus side, there’s no ads other than the popups reminding you to spend money on in-game items.",A new daily chore
3,2023-10-08 14:51:47,Okay i’m not trying to rant but this is a failed game because 1. it’s not fair how you can gather a hole bunch friends and team up to take down one person.2. it’s not fair that the player has no landmarks and they are able to shutdown your landmarks.3. I noticed that if you have a mega heist timer you still barely get a mega heist probably a couple time throughout but other then that the game was fun i’ve been slowly stopped playing soon im gonna stop completely,honest opinion
1,2023-10-05 23:59:22,I have been corresponding with the company for almost a week about the issue and have received nothing but a message saying they sent a make good to my account. I have yet to see anything that is missing including the dice and the 1st place tournament rewards witch were more dice and a blue/gold pack. I have spent over $1000 on this game just in the last month and there customer service department is a joke! If they make it right I will continue to play because I do love the game but until then they won’t receive another dime from me!!,Over 2000 dice plus 1st place tournament rewards missing
4,2023-10-03 21:34:52,"It’s a solid game, however .. there is a lot that I would like to see change. please stop with all of the pop up ads! Players know where to go if we wanna buy something. Please stop giving us duplicate gold cards or make it so we are allowed to trade gold cards!! If that would happen, I would give this game a 5 star. It’s mindless fun but there is also some strategy.","Solid, but needs a few changes"
4,2023-10-02 02:09:48,"Love the game, I play every day. But can we please get rid of the purchase prompts that appear automatically every time you run out of dice, or your dice count falls below tour selected auto roll amount? It’s beyond annoying to be auto rolling at x20, get the prompt to purchase more dice when you fall below the dice count. Then you start auto rolling at a lower multiplier, to get hit with the purchase prompt all over again.",Purchase Prompts
4,2023-09-28 15:24:18,"I really love this game but it’s been very buggy, it’s super hard to get anything and the duplicate cards are annoying because they don’t give you a chance to get new stickers.

It even happened to me where someone hit me 6 times and didn’t wreck any of my builds when I only had 5 shields.",Buggy
4,2023-09-26 16:16:21,"In the beginning, I found myself obsessed with this game. Then they changed things with a few updates and made this game nearly impossible. It takes more to get less.

It's nowhere near as fun because they've made it so difficult to complete sticker albums or to get the tiniest rewards in the tournaments.",Was fun and even addictive at first
5,2023-09-13 14:02:28,The game is really fun but the dice distribution every hour of 8 dice is ridiculous it should be higher or we should be able to purchase dice with our cash and collecting the five Star stamps is time consuming you have everything on your board  but that gold 5 star and you should be able to trade them why give us xtra of it if we can’t trade them.,Dice distribution
2,2023-09-12 22:38:43,Imagine spending money for rolls and raising your multiplier and the game choosing where they want you to land and placing you on tiles that get you nothing over and over and over until your whole $100 purchase was wasted. $100 for some dice to be able to play a game is absolutely absurd. You can buy a video game for any console cheaper and play as much as you want.  Just landed on the same useless spots over and over at least 10x around the board until I was out of rolls. Never in my lifetime of monopoly does that happen rolling dice.,Fun game but rigged

Not landing on the chocolates, combined with not getting gold card, along with not being able to even place it the smaller tournaments, all that equals no dice, which means no completion of any event! Not fun just very frustrating. I’m trying to hang in there but if I use 200 dice to get 20 chocolates, to spin one time and only get 40, makes it real hard to want to keep logging on.

1,2023-09-01 16:37:56,Don’t be fooled by the ads. You really don’t do anything on this game that’s fun. You don’t see yourself visit other peoples boards. They just appear on your board and you collect money from them. You don’t even really know when you’re there.  You “steal money and destroy their property.” It’s not fun.  I TRIED to delete my account. They have you verify who you are to do it. I even gave them a screenshot of my account and they say they can’t verify me. They’d aid I have to start process over to delete. I’ve already done that.  I DON’T WANT this DUMB game or an account by them.  Delete my account,Very disappointing

And every time you open the app you be bombarded with at least 5 different optional purchase pop ups same when you run out of rolls, even if you have some but you have your multiplier set higher pop ups immediately.

3,2023-08-14 21:59:18,I love this game. Like really love it. It’s so much fun and addictive. But there is one thing that is extremely disappointing and discouraging and that is the trading of stickers. There are so many scams out there so when you send your sticker nobody will send the one you need back. Please create an update where it will only send the sticker if a sticker is sent in return.

3,2023-07-23 17:30:08,The game is really fun and I love that you can play and compete against your friends! The worst part about the game is they make rewards almost impossible to reach.

I know it’s not much money but it’s ridiculous four dollars for a pack I want the editors to make this game better every other game for a pack is like $1 and for the savage deals have to buy one for $3 who would do that and than you have two free ones I am not spending money for a stupid game like this I wish it was less money a whole real monopoly board is less than all the prices on the game. I would prefer not to play this game unless your trying to be broke :),It’s good but all the money they ask for
2,2023-06-29 19:57:46,I Love the game and it’s VERY addicting. The only thing I dislike is even when you spend money on packs you get duplicate stickers . I think at least if we are going to spend our money help us out with a NEW STICKERS. Yes the Fb app is also a good way to trade but the scammers and hacker  can put in a fake link that looks similar to the tag we use THEN BOOM.

1,2023-11-01 17:19:13,Obvious money siphon. They studied the algorithms and have executed a very addictive game suited to micro transactions. Beware if you have gambling addiction or really if you have an addictive personality at all. The game also lies. People have told me they knocked down my buildings but I had full shields. Game will say you bankrupt someone but you really didn’t. Now it keeps crushing over and over. The peg game defies the laws of gravity to consistently give you the worst rewards. The partner up games that build cars and similar things consistently big bucks women make you roll low on the wheel to make you want to spend money,Cash grab

Also on the partner events why is it that I do a multiplier and still only get 200 points towards my car.. that shouldn’t be an option when I’m spinning for 200 wheels! It’s ridiculous.

You shouldn’t have to spend 200 puzzle pieces just to land on 400 points or less each time.

1,2023-08-31 10:47:47,I started out loving the game. But it becomes where it’s not casual play and you have to start committing considerable time and money to keep it fun. Collecting the stickers is fun…. until you open dozens of packs and never get the stickers you need but get duplicates of the gold cards that you can’t even trade. Trading stickers is laborious and brings out the very worst in people. When you get higher up you need thousands of dice rolls to complete a board but the game only generates 80 rolls. Mr. Monopoly’s the only one making a killing…. off all us players trying to get that last sticker to complete the album.,Fun….at first!!

Don’t waste your time it’s easy at first with good luck but the farther you climb the more they want you to spend money.

Hard when all you get are a few free rolls a day unless you buy. I’ve had all the pretty stickers except for two for almost a month. And then they put out a $30 guaranteed to get a missing card. If that’s not pay to play I don’t know what is. I’m all for supporting a game and their makers and paying a few here and there. But seriously! It drives everyone to quit and find something else.,Always turns to pay to play

The developers nudge players to go on Facebook groups to ask players to trade or gift stickers but this should really be a built in function within the game itself.

You’re maxed at 80 dice a day and then with free gifts and quick wins you’re lucky to get 150. The tournaments go way too quick for you to complete anything to get more dice. 50 dice to complete a board is ridiculous once you get higher up. The stickers this time around are so hard to get.

I only need non trade able cards to fulfil my deck and it’s annoying no matter how many times I trade in duplicates or how many good card packs I receive I never get them!!!! It seems like every one is struggling to get the same couple cards. Other than that it’s a really good addicting game,ERROR IN CARDS
4,2023-07-25 05:51:20,"I love this game I really do, what I don’t like is that you can get duplicates of gold cards but you can’t trade them. I think if you’re gonna make gold cards non tradable then I feel like you should make it where you don’t get duplicates of them. Because people are stuck on these stickers because they can’t get them or they are only getting duplicates. That’s the only reason I’m giving it 4 stars.",Game changes!
5,2023-07-06 18:13:00,"I’ll admit that this is a really fun game. But to a certain level you’ll just get sick of it. Because it takes too long to get more dice, (no I will not waste money on buying dice rolls), and the stickers received are so repetitive.   Please improve so we can also play more often and enjoy it as opposed to wait one hour for 8 rolls. And that’s it. End game.",Be a bit more generous
5,2023-07-05 16:17:02,Even though you can just play the board game the mobile game is not fun 🤩 now I own New York and London in the game but if you play as a guest be aware that you might have to wait if you use all of your dice 🎲 or you can pay to get dice but this game is very fun and also if you’re playing you can’t change your character so you might wanna have facebook,Monopoly GO is a GO
3,2023-07-06 00:28:13,"The game is actually fun but after you’ve experienced 10 interruptions in one day of The game just shutting down randomly with an error message of how it can’t load its makes it feel not worth keeping the app. Its weird because some ppl still have access and you come back to nearly all of your progress being gone from other players but you can’t get in for hours rather you delete the app and redownload it. Reset your phone, etc. I’m assuming it’s something that needs improvement bc many people are saying the same thing on social media but id rather just wait for big improvements.  Idk I’ll give it another try for a day but if this random error keeps coming up. . Is it really Worth keeping?  Outside of that - cool game I suppose",Terrible glitching / error pop up
3,2023-07-05 21:20:28,"I have had a lot of fun playing this game. My only complaint is that I didn’t want to connect it to an email or Facebook and today it glitched. The app said to restart it a lot of times, so eventually I deleted it and redownloaded it. All of the time I have spent playing this game over the past months has been erased and I now have no desire to put in all of that time to get back to where I was. It is a very fun game but the glitch losing everything is disappointing.",Pretty Fun
5,2023-06-13 22:57:47,I got this game about two weeks ago and it is by far the most fun and time consuming game ever! There are so many boards and so many power ups plus you can steal money and destroy peoples boards that stole money from you or destroyed your board. In general this is probably my all time favorite game and I 💯 percent recommend this game for anyone who has a lot of free time or travels alot,Amazing game
5,2023-10-10 20:21:15,"Love the setup, the challenge, everything about this game is great. From someone who use to play the board game setup all the time as a kid to playing it on my phone as an adult, just b gf rings back so many memories. Especially the one where if you were losing you’d flip the board and leave the table for the youngest sibling to pick it up an put it away.",Addictive
2,2023-11-08 13:32:43,"This game is fun, but when you have to land on specific tiles, suddenly you can’t seem to land on them and have to use more rolls to get the prize. Created to make you spend money if you wanna win tournaments or events. It will also hardly give you new cards. You would think the more you play the more cards you would get but you have to spend money to get those cards you are missing. Starting to fade away from this game. And the wheel spin? Good luck at hoping to land on something useful.",Game plays you
1,2023-11-06 01:10:10,"This app is the worst app in the play store. I’ve tried for weeks to recover my account and they have been no help at all. Once you get to a certain level, they’ll just glitch and take your progress and don’t care to help you recover it. Customer support is a joke. It’s a computer and a human will NEVER come help. I do not and I repeat DO NOT recommend this app. It’s stressful, expensive to play and the company has it rigged for us to fail at all costs. This company has no interest in helping their players with any issues. You’re nothing but dollar signs to them.",Disgusted
2,2023-11-05 21:01:21,I’m paying loyal customer and just recently in last gold sticker trade card wasn’t received. I reached out to customer support and even shared a video of the sticker being sent to me and got no response. The people who play this game love it but the unfair treatment and lack of customer support with certain issues makes me wanna cut my loses and find a new game to play. HELP!!!!!!! Wow then they responded with the same words to everyone instead of really helping people who spend money on their platform,Gold sticker gifted was never received.
1,2023-11-01 16:58:21,So wanna tell me during the last few hours of the event I’m getting nothing but errors and crash and have to restart?  Then when I try to roll again crash error restart so basically I needed one more car and can’t complete it because the stupid game keeps crashing and having errors that’s why I personally hate time events because if a error happens oh well to bad for you cuz the developer doesn’t care he makes his money hate hate time events stupid at least add a hour or two for the people who are suffering like I am,What the heck man what the heck lame
2,2023-10-31 17:30:32,"We play all the time, we partner up, we spend money, we don’t deserve to keep getting green packs when we are past a certain level!!

The the pink and blue pack still give out duplicates. I have 4 or 5 of the same sticker, then 3 or 4 of the same gold stickers. This is disheartening.",Why are y’all doing this to folks…..
3,2023-10-30 19:34:52,I love this game but it gets very annoying I’ve been playing for awhile now and I have yet to get a new card in weeks? It’s dumb I shouldn’t have to add random people just to get new cards I use to get new cards all the time now I never do. I play this game everyday but slowly been moving away from it because in my opinion it shouldn’t be that hard to get new cards and I shouldn’t have to add a bunch of random people just to receive new cards.,Annoyed
2,2023-10-25 22:34:18,The game is fun to play with the family and friends.  We all don’t play as much because we get the same stickers over and over which makes it difficult to complete the objectives.  Then they wanna offer up stuff for money.  Monopoly won’t get a dime from me. They need to fix the issues and make it fair. I shouldn’t be getting stickers of stuff I completed over and over again.   If they can fix this issue it would get more stars until then they won’t eat no more then 2.,Sticker Issue
2,2023-10-18 15:22:53,You start out free and doing ok but a week or so into it and you will spend more money on it than you should! You get the same stickers over and over again and they don’t give you enough dice to go anywhere in the tournaments unless you spend money! Even then the bots in the game make sure you don’t near the top so that you can win anything of value. Don’t download this game it’s not worth it. There are plenty of other games that are FREE and just as enjoyable if not more so because they don’t cause stress!!!!!!,It’s not free

1,2023-09-28 14:07:40,"This game was fun in the beginning, like most the first few boards were flashy and feeling like you win big. Later, your waiting an hour for 8 rolls and no progress. Not to mention opening sticker packs yields the same stickers over and over again, none of which you need to progress. Finishing sticker packs makes you spend money because you aren’t getting the 5 stars you need unless you spend money.   Also with the tournaments, I swear they rig the game so you no longer land on those spots. So many things to complain about in this game after the newness wears off.",PTW
4,2023-09-23 21:20:41,Pretty addicting games! Only downfall I found so far is it is hard to reach customer services. The game charged my bank account for a purchase  I hit by mistake. I did not verify it so the screen came up “canceled purchase” but it still charge my bank account! I have search for a link to talk to someone in customer service. But every link it tells  you to click takes you in circles.,Great Game
1,2023-09-19 18:48:33,With this new update plus several several complaints to customer service. This game is just getting worse I’ve lost cards I’ve lost dice and money while completing entire events plus completing other games and when you complete it they just disappear. All this is doing is pushing people away from playing because what’s the point if you don’t receive your rewards even when complaining and actually showing that you completed the events. All they want is money people that’s it not just a game to have fun,Missing dice money everything

The dice are expensive to buy and the game really isn’t worth the money it wants you to spend to get ahead. Once you get to higher levels, the map is so expensive to build and all they give is a measly 8 free dice per hour tops. That’s not even enough for one stage of one building. It’s dumb. Plus they make it impossible to get the gold cards needed.  Up the dice prizes, give more affordable dice packs that are actually worth the money and let us trade gold cards. You guys are going to lose a lot of players.",Money pit.
4,2023-09-07 20:01:49,This Game is highly addictive in a good way! I love playing this game. It’s a fast paced and easy to play. My only thing that I gave a star away is the new album and how to get stickers. They ways to get higher level stickers makes way more difficult than the last album set. The spinning or dice rolls sometimes makes it feel like it’s rigged. But besides that it’s a great app with the usual frustration.,Monopoly Go is Addictive
1,2023-08-31 23:08:15,The game is trash. Change it from pay to get anything and make it fun. How are y’all gonna make people play everyday without missing a day and can’t even finish the whole album??? Like other people have said about the rolls only getting so many after having to wait an hour to only play for less than 3 mins. Add video ads to get rolls or make it to where we can send friends rolls. I wouldn’t be surprised if everyone stopped playing and y’all are just screwed. Hope y’all made all the money y’all wanted on people for them to not complete one thing.,Trash game!!
3,2023-08-30 01:37:07,I loved it for the first 3 days and now I’m just annoyed with it. At first you’re showered in dice rolls but after the first 5 worlds or so you’re just twiddling your thumbs waiting for more dice rolls. Yes they give you daily’s and 5 hourly but they just don’t rack up fast enough to get more than 5 minutes of daily game play. They also constantly pressure you to buy packs of rolls which I have zero intention on doing. Only game I’m gonna say I wish had ads as an option.,Starts off fun
1,2023-08-29 05:42:43,"literally a horrible game , you don’t even win much, you can’t even get cards. this company is just money hungry. as soon as the it’s 1 week left for the album to end, they come out with a $20 “package deal” like what lol??? a lame and sorry game & of course dumb people play it and pay money so of course monopoly will still keep doing what they’re doing. i get it they need to make money off of the game but they doing too much. don’t even bother playing, it’s fun in the beginning until they start F you over to try to get you to spend money & if you spend money then ur dumb","HORRIBLE game, MONEY HUNGRY company"

Also if there’s away for us to get the rare cards easier/more often that would be great. And if I could give more than five cards away a day that would be great. Also make your purchase bundle cheaper and add a monthly pass.,"Great game, but…"

It has me hesitant to make future purchases.,It’s okay but wish it wouldn’t crash on me
1,2023-08-24 04:18:34,I thought this game would be so fun! It was at first. They make it almost impossible to complete tasks and albums. They only care about people spending money. You have to pay for anything good in this game. It’s way too hard to get rolls. The utilities show they are giving money but you don’t actually get that money. I’ve lost around 100 million so far. The sticker albums offer hundreds of rolls and money but they make sure you don’t get what you need to complete them. They give you duplicate ones that you can’t share. It’s ridiculous.

1,2023-07-30 22:19:06,Don’t get me wrong this game had me hooked in the first few months it was released… I’m talking literally letting laundry pile up because I was so invested… but after you get to a certain place…. Your at a stand still. Note bought dice. Obviously… I’ve seen over 2 million people complain about the same things… stickers are weird… reminder cannot trade gold sticker cards… which is weirder.. lol… I’m giving benefit of doubt and hope they fix the small tweaks to continue to catch players attention… until then this app may stay on standby … back to merge magic it is,Fun @ first then gets old
1,2023-07-30 14:03:20,This is a scam don’t even waste your time trying to get new stickers. I’ve spent a countless amount of money and barely ever get any progress with these stickers. This game is set up to milk as much money as they can from you and I disputed all the transactions from this game because it’s a scam. They will milk you and just keep giving you the same old stickers. And everyone gets the same stickers so you can’t get stickers you need from elsewhere unless that person is way ahead of you.

The amount of dice you get every 20-40 minutes is very dumb as it only gives five, and also there are also no secondary ways to get dice other than adding friends through invites and spending money and as i said before waiting for 20-40 minutes. Please fix this as soon as possible so it is a bit more fair for us players.",The game is fun but stupid
2,2023-07-23 02:44:33,This game is good to play to pass time. But don’t get to involve. It does not give out the cards needed to complete your set. Instead it gives multiple of repeat cards you don’t need. It wants you to join the Facebook group to see if others would trade or gift you the cards missing. The funny thing is …everyone is missing the same exact card millions of people that are playing don’t have the golden cards or 4/5 star card. I don’t like that.

3,2023-10-17 01:13:53,This game is alright. The longer you play the levels have different names but they look the same but cost WAY MORE to complete the board. Buying dice doesn't make sense. Sometimes it says buy 95 dice for $4.99 then it'll say buy 210  dice for $4.99. I dk the rationale or reasoning for the difference. My complaint is the same as others. Why does it take so long to get NEW STICKERS. Why are there 60 days to MAYBE win 15k dice and lastly why can't we exchange GOLD STICKERS!! 🤦🏽‍♀️,Fun at first.... Then  meh

It doesn’t make since to keep giving us duplicates especially if we paying for packs and they should allow u to buy multiple packs of your choice.

You spend too many rolls and get very little money and it cost way too much to build  to the next round, I’ve tried it several several times, but honestly about to delete it, I wanted to really really wanted like this game since I’ve played similar ones that I love but honestly it’s just too slow. I refuse to dump money into a game.",Really disappointed
1,2023-08-31 17:16:17,I have been playing for about 2 months.  The game is somewhat entertaining but don’t get caught up in the contest!  You can not win!  Collecting stickers was the biggest hoax of all time.  It knew exactly which stickers I needed and for a very high price tag you could purchase “stickers you needed”.  All of them for that price? I doubt it.  I needed 8 and my friends had 3 of those I needed but couldn’t trade because they were “GOLD”.  Such a rip off.  Each of the two contest I’ve participated in have caused me to believe “this game has a very self serving profit margin”. Not worth the expense.,Money making app

As you increase your standing on the map, the dice remain at 50. Could at least increase the higher you go. All around great game but hard to enjoy unless you spend lots of money.",Could be better!!!

I then went to Apple Pay and screen shot I’ve $300 to Monopoly go over the last month (yes I’m embarrassed) I sent them every screen shot and they told me that I couldn’t prove I made the purchases.

1,2023-09-25 20:10:10,This game is pretty bad you don’t get enough dice It takes an hour every time to get 6 to 8 dice depending on what level you’re on I don’t recommend it it’s a cash gram game and there are a lot of scammers in the Facebook groups that try to take your money for the  don’t receive you have to collect stickers and it’s really hard to collect any gold ones and there’s one in each set that is really hard to get other than the gold one you need to complete A set I thought this game would be fun but I’m wrong now I understand why I need my blood pressure medication.,Monopoly go

(Depending on your max dice) When other games out there allow you to do more in a day, the dice replenish rate needs severely fixed. It fun and addictive, but you can only do so much.

You should be able to trade one gold a day, or some type of event for it. Stupid. People scam you for stickers online so forget about the fb trading groups. Idk why they couldn’t make a ‘sticker request’ feature where if someone doesn’t upkeep their end of the deal it doesn’t go through. All they want is our money.

That’s just wrong!  Also there is no way to contact customer service to complain which is bizarre! You’ll take my money in an instant but not discuss anything with me. You’re a ghost monopoly go! A freaking ghost!,Fun at first!
5,2023-08-27 02:23:17,Love the game it is truly amazing and addictive however one flaw is the ability to chat with new friends you get in the game. It will be allot easier than going on a different app to exchange stickers with people you don’t know or try to scam you.   In game chat so you can interact and exchange stickers  and talk trash to them,We need in game chat between friends
1,2023-09-10 00:07:34,This game turned money hungry. They wanted to start offering guaranteed sticker packs for $20-$100… this is absurd for a cellphone game. They constantly give duplicate stickers making it hard to fill your sticker boards and then it turned people money hungry trying to SELL their stickers in Facebook groups. There is a minimal amount of rolls that regenerate every hour making it impossible to play unless you get a gift. And let’s not talk about the same 50 rolls you get even when you’re upward of the 90+ level boards. It’s obvious they want you to just spend money to play.,"Ehh,  not great"

Kind of hard to “build the cake” when you rarely land on the cookie tile and when you do, you don’t get all your cookies.  Sometime you can gout around the board two or three times and land on the same tiles everytime. Surely  cannot roll the exact dice combo over and over.   Is this being fixed?",Rewards

I refuse to ever spend a dime on mobile games. They have taken the game from something fun to something that is one of the most egregious cash grabs I’ve ever seen in a mobile game. If the next season fixes things maybe I’ll come back in 90 days. Until then I’ll be doing what I can to get my friends to stop playing the game.

I play with people who pay and people who don’t and we all need the same stickers. If you’re going to take money there should be SOME advantage besides an opportunity to spend more money and then just end up with the same stickers as those who didn’t pay.

But every single time!!! Towards the end.. they just stop giving you new cards. The incentive to buy is ridiculous. Definitely a pay to win game so expect to feel disappointed when you never finish collecting all of the cards.

1,2023-08-16 22:36:31,I’m going to be honest when I first started the game I was indulged in it but over time I notice that the game has been set to bring you down when you are too far up I don’t like how the dice comes back the over three times in a row or how the spin does the same thing now I believe my odds can turn bad but over thirty times in one day. I had 800 rolls and I just had to put 50 golf gloves up but instead the game had me roll till I made it to 30 dice and then start letting me hit I was very furious with that I would like the chance and odds of the dice be more random like real dice,Curious

2,2023-07-25 16:52:53,Good game but need to eliminate all the in app purchase pop ups and increase rolls generated per hour and max rolls. Also the trading system could easily be fixed so you don’t get scammed out of your cards but for some reason they don’t fix it. Someone can trade for your card then just decide to not send anything back in return even if you sent them something. Developers could easily patch this but haven’t for some reason.

If you dont pay a single dime in the game you will never even reach 5th in the events, friends can constantly destroy your landmarks, constantly as in multiple times. People who pay finish up with even more dices and money because events give out ridiculous amounts and since they can get as many points as they want, because they pay for dices, then there's no point in even trying to compete with them.

Now the game has gotten to where you can’t advance without paying for $100 packs to buy cards and dice. The tournaments and partner challenges are unrealistic without paying for rolls. I’ve spent hours playing this game getting to well over 10k net worth and have come to a screeching halt recently. I’m not sure what’s going on but you need to fix it before everybody quits playing.

That you have to wait 24 hours or pay to get rolls. Secondly your about to buy Paris But then you run out of money. In Paris it coast a lot of money.

Been waiting in the chat for over 2 hours and still no one answering my question.  Also what’s worse is how expensive the upgrades get on your buildings and yet you’re not getting better payments. $175 million for one upgrade on one building is a bit extreme especially considering over $1 billion dollars for just one landmark,Fun but difficult
3,2023-08-28 23:19:56,Game is fun at first you have a lot of dice and can level up quickly which gets you addicted but things quickly get expensive and you run out of dice fast.

I enjoy it. I don’t enjoy going to jail though, but if I roll a double which I always do, I get out immediately and I gain 10 dice, I’m enjoying every minute of it, hope your husband do the same for you",TRUE VIBS

However, as someone whose been constantly attacked by the same person over and over again with no way to delete them or block them. I believe that your game needs a feature that allows someone to delete or block people who aren’t their friends in the game but continue to  attack you somehow.",Great game
2,2023-07-12 02:38:40,I was gonna purchase a pack that had dice and they changed it and made the dice amount lower. When you get to higher levels.. The money and dice they give you do nothing and if you purchase dice they aren’t gonna give you anything good You can pay $20 and only get 600 dice and some money and a card pack with at least 1 four star card. I feel like this is a complete rip off. I have more things that I genuinely don’t enjoy on the game but I’ll leave it at that.☹️,The game is starting to feel like a rip off
5,2023-07-10 22:16:12,It’s only been the last 2 weeks. I would get a great win and the game would just shut down. I would win dice and I get the “oops error notification”. Idk how they got so many bugs in such a short time. I can understand a day or two but 2 weeks? Y’all need to get it together. U also owe me a lot of imaginary money and dice 😂😂,Love the game but the glitching is unreal
5,2023-05-24 20:47:46,So at first I was like oh okay I guess I’ll give this game a try hoping it wasn't like the other games that kept trying to force me to pay for things and it actually is like the real game board now I have to force myself off the game I highly recommend this game if your just looking to speed through time 💗💗,Highly recommend this
5,2023-04-29 19:12:39,I love monopoly! Always have and people always complain it takes so long so they don’t wanna play or whatever and playing this i get to play as much as I want within my rolls lol & come back later to run up a bag and monopolize later! It’s also helping me get out of the savings mindset and investments . So I love it & I can’t wait to get a hotel on boardwalk 😈,Super funnn phone game
5,2023-10-17 14:41:06,The first time I saw it I had to look at it because it was so cute and I was so happy with it I was like wow that’s a really cool idea and I just got it for free and I was just gonna buy a bunch more stuff for it so I’m not sure what the heck I’m doing but I’m just glad I got to get it and I’m happy and he made out with me,The only reason why I’m asking is to see money
1,2023-04-26 02:45:29,"This game is somewhat fun, BUT you have to wait one hour for 5 dice (that gets used up in two seconds). You get the hourly dice, only if you open the app. Even then, if I close it and reopen the app, it doesn’t count accurately. I’ve had the game for about one week. I’m starting to get bored waiting a whole day, to play for a few seconds at a time. By the time I get enough dice to actually play, my buildings are damaged and I don’t have enough money to do anything. I’ll probably delete the game in the next day or two. The game ‘1010!’ is way more fun and truly free.","Wait for dice, or pay to play."

I just messaged in about a guy that was scamming MULTIPLE people out of cards and the customer support team kept passing me around until someone pretty much told me they didn’t care and to wait 24 hours so I did and I messaged back in. 7 hours later and once again there is no response. It would be a great game if customer service actually cared or did their job.,Terrible customer service
3,2023-11-10 09:58:46,The game is rigged for you to buy dice. You stop getting the cards you need and most of people on the trading site will charge to trade. You don’t get enough dice most of time unless you buy them. On the special quests you hardly land on what you need so you don’t finish the whole quest. To get anywhere in the game you have to put a lot of money out for dice. A lot of my friends quit playing because of this and I am about done also.,About to quit
1,2023-11-09 22:22:55,"Hi all, I plan on sharing both live gameplay and a bunch of recent captures of how this game is rigged. How it will “roll” your dice and take your dice but not actually move you or anything, just takes your dice. So they thing they are trying to sell you the whole time, they’ll just steal back from you, but you can’t have your money back, they just take the dice you just bought from you. Need to land on something certain for rewards, come join me as I show you the probability of landing on every tile normally vs when a event is happening.","Rigged, and to show."

I used to be able to complete all of the cars but this time I have spent double the money and still cannot complete the cars. Why is the cost going up? Spending all of this money is not feasible. They need to rethink the algorithm unless they want us to quit because we feel ripped off. My friends have been feeling the same way.,Partner cars has increased

Literally 0 in 16 hrs. (I could be well on my way 4/4 but no- person doesn’t even have a profile pic)  3: would like to scroll around to the build sites without hitting the button.  4: would like some basic communication icons with friends.  5: I’ve rolled 8000, seriously, saved my 5000 from last partner game,  and I feel that the icons on the board should be more than a 1:1, and also not logarithmic modified to not land on them  6: post some stats about card drops.  It’s so annoying to get a 4 star pack and get nothing new. No reason to spend 8000 rolls, not a single new card.",Some improvements
1,2023-10-30 02:53:04,I use to actually enjoy playing this game. I felt like I wasn’t forced to buy things. But now they rig the system. They only give low star stickers and this most recent Halloween event is a JOKE. I started with several dice and the system is rigged to spin on bad points. Not to mention they made it 80k points when others were 60k but refused to adjust the points. It’s impossible to win unless you’re constantly buying overpriced dice.   Please save yourself the time. I will be deleting this app and recommending all my friends who I recommend to quit as well.,SCAM! Greedy company
3,2023-10-28 18:44:34,The game is great and addictive…. it’s a great game to play at work or home or to pass the time waiting for a appointment for an example. my only complaint is that the rolling for stickers is a pain. The cost for things is expensive but I don’t care because me and my wife are enjoying it. But to can’t getting the same stickers all the time is crazy; one month left in playing for the challenge left with no progress in new sticker is nuts.,Love the game

3,2023-10-16 17:43:14,I really loved this game for first 2/3 months I played but the stickers are the same. All of my friends are needing the same ones so there is no trading. The FB group people scam so not interested. I took a day and didn’t play and when I came back the next day I realized why I didn’t miss it. So disappointed! I have a group txt with friends to trade and that is going dead because they are all feeling the same. Hoping something good is to come! 🤷🏻‍♀️,Love / hate

1,2023-10-10 19:29:24,It’s laughable how obvious you make it to waste dice playing this game  When an event requires landing on corners you always miss it by one when an event requires landing on railroad you hit the corners every pass……. It should be illegal how these games do this nonsense to try and get suckers to drop insane money for a few min of rolling dice and On more then one occasion I’ve gone to bed and when I get up and start game I am missing dice I had 253 dice last night this now first time in game I have 115 Smfh I’m gonna start screen shotting every time I turn game off,Waste of time completely pay to win game
4,2023-10-03 16:25:09,"The game is lots of fun, BUT, they cheat you by not giving you new cards more often. Maybe try giving them out more so we can actually receive them all.

2,2023-10-07 18:32:37,This game is like drugs. You get hooked and start spending and spending. In retrospect..  there is no end to the “game”.  There is no “getting ahead”. They rig the game to give you less during events so you are desperate and end up spending money. I am confidant they use bots disguised as other players to also make you want to “beat” these high achieving players in the events. It’s a giant and endless money scheme. Might as well play the real lottery and have a real life chance of winning something. You never really win in this game.,Money Pit Rigged Game
4,2023-09-29 23:08:42,This game is super fun but could be a lot better and more worthwhile. Waiting a whole hour just to get a handful of dice rolls is really killing the game. And the constant duplicates of stickers is annoying and u would love to be able to trade more than 5 stickers a day. Overall like I said the game is really fun but if it wants to have some longevity some serious changes need to happen.,Fun but pay to play.
5,2023-09-09 03:23:03,I haven’t been playing this game all too long however the more you play the more you progress the more you progress the more expensive property upgrades are. There should be more of an opportunity to earn more rolls. There are lots of events that do help however it takes a lot of rolls to collect.,If only!
4,2023-09-28 14:25:34,"I love the concept of the game but I hate the rewards and sticker packets. Why am I on level 240 paying billions to build hotels and still getting cheesy 1 star stickers, duplicates and a measly 25/30 dice as gifts.

I’m the beginning it was fun but not anymore if you like to play. The prices increase to build and getting out of jail is over a million bucks, landing on taxes or luxury tax is over a million as well. Giving us 50 dice to continue playing is not good. You give us the ability to multiply our rolls and yet it does not good as we only get 8 dice an hour. It’s a joke after a certain point.",One sided
1,2023-09-09 19:18:34,This game is a huge scam for money. Talk about pay to play. They only want you to send money and when you have issues and contact support they literally never get back to you. I’ve spent hundreds on this game and get stiffed every time. After an update a few weeks ago I lost all of my tokens have messaged support easily 10 times and nothing. Would give a 0 star if I could.   Also I’m not the only one joining the FB groups or even reading the comments on this games page you’ll see that they do this to everyone  Save yourself the time,Scam.

2,2023-08-24 10:51:23,Repetitive but fun for the most part. The stickers need revisions.  They take your hard earned hotels and give you worthless stickers.  It’s impossible to complete all the albums. They hold onto the rare ones unless you pay for them. When you trade the extras in you get more worthless stickers and a few dice. A meaningless and worthless trade. A lot of the rewards in the game are a pair of these ridiculous stickers. You pile up shutdowns and heists and your reward is two worthless stickers.  It’s really irritating.,Worthless stickers
3,2023-08-05 01:17:59,Gave it 3 star because its a very slow paced gamed with getting 5 moves every hour. Then being faced with 5 different ads to buy dice. I feel like using your cash other than just buildings would be nice. Incorporating a way to use cash for dice or something other than just buildings. Making it a little faster than what it is.

If u choose the trade one,  and you sent the card the other person receives this message “somebody sent you —— card”, in order for u to receive it you need to send the card back. You have 1 hour or the trade expires. So that this stupid people cannot scam.

I haven’t gotten any new cards in a while but the issue I’m having now is THE GAME KEEPS GIVING ME AND ERROR AND PUTTING ME BACK A WHOLE BOARD BACK. I’ll upgrade all my buildings and move up a map and start playing on that new map when I get an error and it puts me all the way back to the previous board with nothing built. It’s getting frustrating and I’ve actually spent real money on this game. It gives me my money back and things like that when the error happens but any progress I made like rolls on the new board disappears. Please fix this.,Very upset

You always get duplicate low level stickers. The vaults aren’t worth anything. Now they’ve rigged the game so you hardly land on RR or items you need. The devs got money hungry and it’s obvious.

It’s to scammy with all its pop ups during the game to offer you “deals” on dice.

5,2023-09-17 03:02:20,"The only thing I would complain on is how the dice reloads it’s 5 rolls every hour, it’s just to get you to buy more I think it’s corny tbh at least if it was 10 rolls a hour would make more sense once you run out of rolls and don’t purchase any you have to wait hours and hours to play again 🤷‍♀️",My one complaint
5,2023-09-11 14:52:42,I like this game so far the only thing about it is I thought it’s supposed to be two players. So when I’m just going across the board I am not understanding if it’s me or someone else. I just wish they can do better as far as helping with how many players supposed to be on the board,Just wanna know how the players work
1,2023-09-12 11:18:10,I really don’t understand how this game has so many high reviews.. I will say the game is extremely addicting in the first couple weeks! Because scopely purposely gives you stuff you want/need to reel you in. About three weeks in the game gets to an absolute stand still unless you spend money! You can’t do ANYTHING because Scopely is so greedy with dice to even play their game! $100 USD for 4000 dice that can be rolled in ten minutes? And if you roll 1X you don’t make it anywhere forcing you to roll high… just save yourself from this money grab,Biggest MTX grab I have EVER played!
4,2023-09-11 19:27:59,Gave it a 4 star bc I don’t like how u can only trade 5 cards a day make it like 10 a day or maybe make it to where u can trade the gold cards bc I have so many albums almost done that just needs the gold cards but can’t ever pull them in the card packs also the dice needs to go up in value for every board u finish. Other than that I love the game👍🏼.,Tweaks that need to be made in Monopoly go

You get 8 rolls per hour, and need over 100 rolls to get half of what you to complete a task. they have limited how many rolls you get from Facebook friends because they want you to buy them instead.

3,2023-08-29 23:30:05,It would be perfect if you add a way to send a request/ trade to your friends for stickers instead of having to rely on external apps to communicate.   I also agree with the mega steal feedback others are saying. You can have it for 10 min but it doesn’t apply to each heist during that timeframe.   I also agree that the game should have a better system for how we earn/ trade gold stickers.,Please sticker request feature in app

I had almost 3000 dice and I have not got a single new sticker I play them two at a time, so it’s not like I’m wasting a bunch. Played for hours over the last couple days. … Please put a button in the game to reach you … please let me know how much I have to pay to get the new stickers, so I can get more than the two out of 24 packs finished.

4,2023-08-25 20:25:31,Don’t do it. You get addicted then stuck because you can never win dice…or not enough to do anything. You spend days waiting for cards that no one will trade because everyone is waiting for cards. Only way to move forward is to keep purchasing packs and who wants to spend tons of money to not even get what you need…just don’t…it’s mentally challenging lol,Don’t download

You could also start a discord channel.",Super dope
4,2023-07-29 15:57:32,My granddaughter asked me to download the app and play.  I am enjoying myself but I do have a complaint.  You only earn 5 dice per hour and unless you earn extra dice it doesn’t take long to use them up.  I have reached the level where my maximum dice are 60.  Therefore it will take 12 hours to get a full set.  This may cause some to get disinterested quickly.  Just a thought.,Sadie grandma
4,2023-07-27 02:23:01,"Would have been 5 stars if you actually got enough incentives in the game. The cards you can go 5 days without getting a new card.

4,2023-07-17 03:08:17,My only complaint (and why I didn’t rate it 5 stars) is that when you run out of dice it takes sooooooo long to get it full again. I wish that at certain levels instead of increasing the number of dice you get that it would decrease the amount of time it takes.

Everyone is looking to get the same cards. You can’t compete in the daily challenges if you never have rolls. The big kicker is the board algorithm changes depending on the event.

I understand that’s part of the game but it’s a bit too coincidental that it happens every time you’ve accumulated any large amount of money.  Like within minutes every time.

I could play this game for hours is I didn’t have anything else to do! You can level up to new city’s and bank heist other players! You can even add friends on here! Trust me you want to play this game! Go ahead down load it ITS AMAZING!!,Amazing! 🚨READ THIS🚨
1,2023-06-22 04:21:07,"I think they should update the game because for your free gift that you get not the daily gift with the dog treat, but the one that you have to wait 18hrs for never gives me the chance to collect it always says “0 seconds left” bit doesn’t give me the option to collect and and it’s very annoying when you don’t have any money, or rolls, or if you need 1 more card to complete a set FYI this is my favorite game in the world and I don’t want to have to delete it because of this little mistake just please fix it and that will be awesome 😎!!",Review on Monopoly Go!
5,2023-05-22 11:52:12,"It is a very good game, it entertains me a lot and I can play it with my friends. But I give it 4 stars because when I downloaded the game I sent an invitation to join to several people and they joined with my link but It only register 2 people when there are more than 10 who joined through my link. And obviously I don’t get my Price ☹️",Good Game
2,2023-06-02 01:19:23,I really enjoyed it until everything became suddenly flooded with “pride” stuff. I just wanted a game to relax and play and actually get away from all of the political stuff. I have no issues with anyone and their life choices. I just am tired of things like this needing to be included in everything. Especially something as simple as monopoly. I’m very neutral on the subject I just don’t think this was really a place it was necessary. Deleting this app. Truly disappointed…,Don’t understand why it can’t just be a game.
5,2023-04-26 23:57:45,"With this game, you should look forward to only playing once a day until you have to pay out of pocket for more rolls. Absolutely ridiculous that you only get 5 more rolls an hour after running out. That’s why it’s best to play before bed so you wake up the next day with full rolls!",You will only play 1 time a day
2,2023-04-27 12:34:25,I got sucked in to this immediately. I like games that are passive time killers…. But it takes way too long to accumulate dice rolls. 5 every hour is ridiculous. Even after half a day I only get a few minutes of play. The pop ups are incessant. With rolls accumulating so slowly I have zero incentive to keep opening the app back up to play and after only a couple days I’m already ready to delete it because I won’t sink a bunch of money into it. It’s not worth it.,Fun but requires too much $
5,2023-04-13 22:37:52,Love love the game! Super polished experience with great design and art. Only complaint is that I ran out of rolls really quickly and have to wait a long time to play again. Why isn’t there an option to watch an ad to get more rolls??? The only alternative right now is to spend $$ which prevents me from playing further.,Need more rolls
3,2023-04-17 14:51:49,Overall good game. The idea behind it and execution is really well put together. My only complaint is that there are too many pop ups when logging in. I get that this is a free to download game but the amount of times I have to close annoying pop ups with all different “deals” and “promotions” asking me to spend my money is annoying and there needs to be a way to limit or remove them completely,Pop Ups
5,2023-10-24 17:07:50,I could play this game for hours and for those complaining about a cash grab honestly haven’t spent a cent on this game and I still have a wonderful time it’s fun for all ages and it’s nice to pop in every now and then and utilize the free dice given every hour highly recommend this super fun game,Extremely addictive but so worth it
4,2023-11-11 14:05:33,"I like this game because it has a bunch of fun things to do like smash other peoples boards or do stuff and get money! It’s almost like your really playing the game. You can also invite your friends to play with you. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because you need wi-fi to play. Other than that, I consider downloading it and you’ll have so much fun I promise.",Monopoly GO!
3,2023-11-10 20:20:03,"At first the game is great, a lot of fun. As you advance the number of dice received for clearing a board doesn’t keep up. It takes more spins to earn the money for property purchases. Then when you get to a certain point, you only get the same stickers you have been getting for weeks. You trade them in to get the same stickers you traded. It seem to set you up for failure.",Low dice and higher money to purchase properties
2,2023-11-02 12:14:26,"This game is fun! But I’m frustrated after working so hard to complete the car event, only to have my new 4* sticker-sleep in gold, disappear once I reopened the app later in the day. Stickers are hard enough to come by but to have it go missing after receiving it is frustrating. I do love this game and play daily, I just feel like all of my accomplishment with this event were wasted if I am not a little closer to trying to finish the sticker set because my sticker disappeared.",Frustrated
1,2023-11-01 20:08:11,"I’m getting the same stickers no new ones. I’m not getting the correct amount of dice. You try to use the wheels for the spooky car  challenge and get absolutely nothing. Then as you’re trying to finish by yourself y’all send 500 wheels, just for me to spin it and it gives me absolutely nothing to build it up. In fact pretty much the whole time I was trying to build that wheel gave me nothing. All you want to give is some Monopoly money. I’ve spent money to play and still nothing new and nothing that helps.",This is ridiculous
1,2023-10-31 19:55:55,I’ve been playing this game for quite some time and I just keep getting the same exact stickers no matter what kind of sticker pack I get. I won first place and few times in the tournament and still got low star stickers every single time. I also got all the prizes in the community chest and few times and still got the same exact stickers once again. And the only reason I got any new stickers now is because of friends. I just hope with all these upgrades to the app that you update the sticker selection.,‼️No New Stickers⁉️
3,2023-10-29 19:02:40,"When you roll an 8 and only go 7 spaces it can mess with your rewards. Also, why won’t you let more gold cards out.. I have completed to level 136 and only have 5 gold cards? Seems like you don’t want people to win, kinda like gambling. Also, it is so hard to collect dice to keep playing. I’m sure the excuse is “buy packs For more rewards”. Some of us don’t have unlimited funds with this inflation.",Dice are wrong
5,2023-09-28 17:40:42,Keeps saying no Internet but there isn’t anything wrong with my Internet. In the meantime people are taking money from me and shield’s because I can’t get on. All my other games are working fine. It worked this morning but it hasn’t connected since about 4 hours ago.,Won’t load
3,2023-10-23 00:39:29,"I love this game at first. I don’t understand why there are certain stickers you can only get from the game but you can play for weeks on end and the game never gives you those stickers. Even when you sell back the stickers in your album, you get back the same stickers you just sold that is pointless. It also takes too long to refresh for new spins.","Momentary fun, eventual disappointment"
3,2023-10-20 01:45:58,Games fun it’s addicting and u gotta spend to win rewards. My complaint lately is when things don’t work such as community chest and not receiving rewards from them and also not getting credit for new friends joining.  Customer service isn’t great either bc I’ve been making complaints for a week and some and issue still happens and cs doesn’t reach out other than that no complaints,Games fun
3,2023-10-14 02:48:46,"Really well put together game, some great touches art wise, incredibly expansive, lovely animations.  Gameplay elements are actually quite varied and its easy to make progress without spending any money.  But at the end of the day its a glossy slot machine and rigged like any slot machine is.  Every roll at times will feel like a “just missed” push towards you spending.  As long as you aren’t competitive there’s no need to, enjoy it as a little time waster.",Very fun slot machine
3,2023-10-08 14:56:19,"Some levels are easy to complete. Others are impossible. Unless you are willing to keep dump money into this game, just be happy you can roll 6, 7 or 8 times an hour and winning what you win. I wasn’t getting my “winning “ on the tournament, daily treats, community chess… I reached out to the chat hoping they would help resolve the issue, but nothing ever came of it. The game is fun, but it could be better.",Could be better
4,2023-10-04 14:35:41,I like playing the game but they have made it super hard to get the gold stars. During the most recent toy event I competed for the top prize and was award 3 duplicate gold star cards and I still need 2. Toooooo many duplicate cards in general for the 1-3 star cards and super hard to get 4-5 star cards and gold cards. Depending on your progress the purchasing is really high. So the higher u go the more u pay😕,Ok App
1,2023-10-03 22:42:56,"With the algorithm in this game, you’re better off going and wasting money at a casino. This game sets you up perfectly just to the point where you start enjoying the mindless entertainment but then they make it impossible unless you spend money on it. They also crash constantly and have glitches that affect your money and dice during gameplay, then ‘reward you’ with a small fraction of what they made you lose as an apology. Don’t do it, and if you do don’t bother spending a dollar because it’s the biggest scam.",Money grab
4,2023-09-28 15:55:50,"It’s a cute game, there are certainly some money grab tactics in play but I have enjoyed it fully without spending any money. However recently I cannot get the game to load. It takes about 5 minutes to just get to 30% losing on the opening page. Not sure if it’s an update or my phone but it’s a shame either way.",Fun and cute with some issues
1,2023-09-28 16:12:46,"After playing for a few months, suddenly the game stopped.  It will show an error message every time I tried to reload it again.  The app is updated when it is necessary so it is not the phone. Turned off the phone and turned back on.  Close the game for hours etc…Why is this happening when on several occasions I had pay for extra dice in order to get to the next level.   Maybe they want to push for Another monopoly game that requires monthly subscription?",Suddenly the game stop uploading
5,2023-09-09 13:46:53,"I wasn’t really good at the monopoly game myself, but then I saw monopoly go and even though there is ads, they’re very very short, I also really love how it can be really really easy for people who don’t understand how to do it and also you get money very fast and I just love how fun it is, I honestly think you should get it now",The best game ever!!!!!
1,2023-09-27 03:32:56,The fact that everyone else has gotten the update and the gold star packet plus the 25 dice and that it only goes to certain people is really annoying. Not only that but I having a key already done in the community chest and putting in multiple complaints about it and nothing being done about it. My over all rating of this game for this game overall is a one star. Only giving certain people better things and other people not the same as if this is the lottery and gambling is messed up.,Over aspect of the game
1,2023-09-21 15:14:57,The game is fun an all but Monopoly makes it impossible for you to complete the albums. They want you to spend money on dice and on cards so you can complete the album. Getting 50+ duplicate cards and not getting any that you need is completely unacceptable. This needs to be fixed before you start losing a lot of players. Everyone seems to be expressing the same expressions but no changes have been made. Also who gives out 50 dice for completing a whole level when you spend over 500 finishing it. Horrible !!!!!,Bad Tactics
3,2023-09-15 13:59:37,This game is super fun it’s hard to win sometimes in events . Building takes so much money after certain levels and you don’t get that much dice after you complete boards as you get higher up. I think it would be fun to be able to see your friends albums to help trade cards for more rewards. I love the community chest although I just wish I didn’t get common pack I wish it was more rare ones .,Never ending
5,2023-08-30 13:58:43,Got invited to play this game by some friends. Always loved the original board game and now I get to play a different version of it on mobile. Attacking your friends is too funny as it becomes a back and forth battle to supremacy. I completely recommend this game if you like messing and/or competing with your friends.,Too much fun!
1,2023-09-08 12:43:41,"This game is highly addictive, on purpose, and they make you spend money to keep playing. When the game glitches (which it glitches often), customer service will not respond or help compensate you for what you have lost.

Stickers are so easy to get! It’s honestly such a nice feature to get gold cards that you can do literally nothing with (if you get them). This game is all about luck (lol).

Many of my friends who play this game have revived the option to buy one of the purple “missing sticker” packs but I have not. I only need one more sticker and it’s gold so it can’t be traded, and with less than 24 hours this is the only way I’ll be able to finish all of the sticker sets.

I submitted where I was charge and didn’t receive and then game keep freezing. I am upset that I haven’t got response back from you all. I needed those dice and stickers that paid .

3,2023-08-27 12:39:38,This review is not for everyone but MonopolyGO is something that makes ur mind ease when ur taking care of ur children and older parents. People don’t really care about books or candy land anymore they are over rated because u just always have to restart cause u either fell down a ladder or lost your page. So I have to say this games ok but I’d rather just spend my time with family and not worry about anyone else’s business.,Game

4,2023-08-23 07:52:56,I had this game for almost an year and it was not how I was expecting so I would rather have the game for three months there are two reasons why I gave four stars Number one in the beginning it is very very fun but eventually it’s very very boring Number two it feels like just rolling the dice getting fake money and building houses which we don’t actually pay for,Not bad
4,2023-08-20 03:02:49,Love the game. I just have a few suggestions. I think we should be able to trade gold stickers. Its a shame how many duplicates I have. Secondly I think when we complete a board the dice should go up like the money. Or go up every 5-10 boards. And lastly we should be able to send dice to our friends even if there’s a daily limit (maybe 25 dice a day or 50).,Suggestion
4,2023-08-13 06:10:54,This game is so much fun but the little amount of dice you get when you upgrade to a new place is horrible the barley give you any dice and it makes it not fun to get even 200 dice if you buy it is so expensive and not even worth it it definitely could use some upgrades with dice especially the higher you get on boards you should get more dice then just 50,.
2,2023-08-09 06:24:56,This game started out fun but ended up being seriously impossible to level up considering they have you looking for stickers that they make super impossible to get and it actually makes you not want to play it anymore. I honestly see why some people just stop playing it out of nowhere. You constantly get the Sam stickers over and over and you end spending way too much money trying to level up and get the stickers you need.,Impossible to level up
3,2023-08-08 00:10:19,I really enjoy playing this game with my son. The thing that ticks me and many others off is THE FACT THAT YOU CANT TRADE THE GOLD STICKERS what is the point of giving us duplicate gold stickers when we can't trade them to our friends? Trading them in is absolutely pointless cause it turns around and gives you MORE duplicates of what you already have. You would think by trading them in you would new ones you don't have. Please fix this,Fix this!

I got first place 3 times on three different tournaments just to get common stickers when I’ve already completed those sets. So now I have x4 or x6 on 2 star stickers just to exchange them for more boring common stickers.

3,2023-07-20 19:36:47,"To me the game is truly fun.  But after awhile when you run out of dice you have no way of getting more. Especially if you can’t afford it. So if the game offered an video add for more dice instead of waiting an hour for a few too.  Then the trading cards.  You never get the ones you need. Even after you’ve hit the good stack of cards, or after you’ve passed the level that was even similar to the album..",My honest opinion

I’ve asked about seven friends of mine if they have the stickers and they don’t either! This game is so fun but it’s no longer worth my time or my money! Definitely unhappy. Not to mention they have made it difficult to email them about issues. I tried clicking multiple links like it suggested and it always took me back to articles! SO FRUSTRATING,So frustrating

I even purchased a $50 pack deal with a pink pack included and STILL never received a new sticker! I only need 6 more cards to complete the album and have yet to get a new one in days.

4,2023-11-08 22:43:09,I absolutely love this game and have fun playing it with family and friends. But why does it have to have a constant notification.

2,2023-05-21 22:40:09,The game idea is a great one. Good in game designs and progression style. Although it is crammed full of micro transaction pop ups that is pushes quite aggressively. If you run out of rolls it’s will prompt you 3 to 4 times on how you can buy rolls and keep going or invite a ton of people to get a few. Then there are “seasonal” packs and those get pushed every time you open the app. It is free to play but the further you get in the longer it will make it harder to play without paying for things.,Overloaded with micro-transactions

Now let’s talk about all this god forsaken pop ups!  Why have all the things on the left hand side of the screen AND all the pop ups?  I am an adult I can clearly see where to spend my money!

2,2023-10-24 13:09:13,"At first it was super fun but as I have been playing the amount of daily dice you receive has gone down a lot. Plus, I’m on level 124 and their is just no incentive to keep going. The prizes seem smaller than the low levels which makes no sense considering it requires a ton of coins to get past these levels. I am talking in the millions. Do better or I’m out. Oh and the stickers, total waste of time. I don’t even pay attention to them anymore.","Fun at first, frustrating now"

The rolls are definitely fixed to have you land on a railroad about 75-80% of the time. If you like landing on those railroad properties, you will LOVE this game! I’m deleting because of how frequent I’ve landed on a railroad. Yes, I’m aware I’ve said “railroad” a whole bunch. Once you play it, you will understand why. Enjoy those RAILROADS!!!",Eh. It’s ok
5,2023-10-13 15:12:31,"It’s so crazy how this old board game has been modified and turned into some fun, amazing game. Where you can play with ur family and friends, you can attack their landmarks  to slow them down from trying to advance. It’s sooo much fun my family, friends and I love playing together we have an amazing time.",Crazy
3,2023-10-15 04:54:27,"I liked the overall concept. Fun at first and then becomes repetitive. Very annoying with the constant tiles wanting you to buy packages. Especially when you run out of dice. Totally obnoxious. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that this game does NOT sync to iCloud or Game Center. I purchased a new iPhone, NOTHING transferred over. It started me over as brand new. No way to restore. I was near level 110. This game was good while it lasted but I’ll be deleting.",Started off ok. Became repetitive.
2,2023-10-14 19:48:34,"Absolutely loved this game in the beginning, but now there are so many people that know how to cheat it and they are getting thousands of dice.. they win all the tournaments and are able to get the 4and 5 star cards. Meanwhile, the rest of us are trying to play with our 8 dice an hour..very frustrating, and it doesn’t help that the game glitches and takes what few dice you have. Fix it so once you delete the game you can’t get your progress back..",Too many cheaters
5,2023-09-11 21:52:54,"This is an amazing game it’s really fun and it’s great to get the family playing the stickers are my favorite part. The only think I wish could be changed is that you can get extra of the gold cards but can’t trade them, it would be nice if we could trade them and get the extra rolls for completing albums",Amazing game
2,2023-10-11 22:54:13,I gave this one star because it started out fun but now it’s hard to get new cards. I haven’t gotten a new card in forever I do get cards but always the ones I already have. Dice are hard to get and random people can target you over and over and over. I understand I downloaded the game to play but I also have a job. Some people just sit around all day and beg and play. It’s getting ridiculous. And to save stars to exchange dupes I have and I get dupes in return and no new cards at all.,SMDH
2,2023-10-08 01:02:32,"This game is fun only when you have actual rolls to play with.  Unless you are willing to spend your own money to buy them, there is a lot of down time waiting for the free ones given, which isn’t enough to do much with.   In the time that you are waiting for free rolls opponents have to the opportunity to destroy your properties.  So when you do have rolls,  you are earning money just to repair them.  It would be more enjoyable if there was a way to get more rolls, more often.",Boring
4,2023-10-06 22:43:44,"I enjoy this game but there are a few issues that I don’t like which is why I’m not giving it 5 stars.  For  partner events we should have to option to delete the partner if they aren’t contributing. Secondly, the 4 and 5 star stickers are almost impossible to get. The rare times I do get  one, it’s a duplicate. We don’t get reward led enough dice for finishing boards.",Losing interest
1,2023-10-06 11:36:34,So last night before I went to bed I had 4796 dice I woke up with 120 !? How!? What type of scam is going on here? I took a screenshot and recorded because I just had a feeling that was gone happen because honestly that’s not the first time something like that has happen to me but before I couldn’t remember exactly how many dice I had so I couldn’t press the issue . This time I took a screenshot! I spend way to much money to get dice and more money to win the event and now y’all take my dice away? Who is responsible for replacing it? Is this a scam or what?!,Missing dice
1,2023-10-03 05:04:20,There was a big technical issue. Everyone loss big time. I spent $34 on an offer and I didn’t get it. I even sent the screenshot of the purchase. I was told I’ll get my dice ( which I still haven’t) then I was told I have to get in touch with Apple because unfortunately they couldn’t do something and now I’m being told they couldn’t find the purchase. So now we have a ghost in the game stealing data information!!! I’m very upset and I will be canceling my account and I will never play again EVER!!! Kudos monopoly for stealing all of our hard earned coin’s,Thieves
1,2023-09-28 19:40:02,This game used to be fun but now it’s just getting quite frustrating and annoying. It costs so much money to buy anything. It’s to the point where it’s costing billions to complete a board. In order to complete any of their separate missions for rewards is insane. The same stickers over and over again. Can’t gift the golden ones but you hardly ever get them but don’t worry you’ll get 17 of the same pointless 1 star stickers that are totally pointless. It’s very obvious that this game was made for one thing and one thing ONLY. MONEY! smh.,Rip off!
3,2023-09-24 11:39:58,"Love the game but I’ve been refunded stickers and still put over my daily trade limit with no explanation. Have landed to get gold cards multiple times and still can’t get the ones I need in that star level. Instead I’m getting multiple, untradeable golds which is useless. Plus getting new 5 star cards is almost impossible without spending real money when the amount of dice you get to roll is a joke",Eh
3,2023-09-23 01:20:52,"The reason I’m writing this do you stars is because it’s not it’s fun but it’s not that fun and like when I’m bored and I have nothing to do when I can’t pick a game I pick this one because it actually has lots of things you can, Caleb people and like you can build buildings like I finish my town in the whole entire board and that was fun to buildings. It looks like Los Angeles and stuff, so yeah you should probably download the game.",The wonders of monopoly
3,2023-09-20 23:32:48,"I love the concept of the game having played the board game growing up. It is fun and entertaining especially when connected to friends. I love the special events.  My issues are as follows: 8 dice per hour until you reach 80 then none. No matter how high a level you reach, you only get 50 dice for completing your board. These issues lead me to believe the developers are in this to make mega dollars because Monopoly money is abundant but more dice are sold for real money.  Counting is often off. I see many times the count is one short of the dice roll.  The reward for completing your sticker album is less than the previous album.  I hope the developers will take a look at the big picture to keep the game fun and exciting.",Great game but
2,2023-09-20 20:16:23,"The measly 8 dice an hour you get is pathetic. Oh you can BUY dice but they are over priced. The stickers you receive are slow to get what you need and most time duplicates. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT!  I tried to contact customer service 11 days ago and no response. It is a text/chat chain. Every day I add a comment stating another day has passed with no reply from customer service.

I understand that the idea is doing profit but this is ridiculous. The game is designed for you to lose all the time with a little hope that you are going forward.

For the shut downs, I think it should be a lever that determines how hard you hit the landmark you’re choosing, and how much money you’ll receive for that hit.   BRING MORE MINI GAMES LIKE THE CAR SHOW. MAKE GIFTING ROLLS A THING. Lol.   The golden tickets are just plain IRRITATING. I wish they could be gifted as well, but only after a certain stage. Like stage 50 or something. Also, the purple pack and blue pack of stickers should have at least a minimum of one 5 star sticker. Everytime. Just my opinion though.

Us receiving only 8 dice per hour is ridiculous. It’s been way harder to receive gold cards.

Instead of making it a more fair, even balanced field to get everything on our own without buying every single day to keep up and finish before the end date 🤦🏻‍♀️",No dice!!
4,2023-09-07 22:11:46,"I gave this game a four star because there is some cons to this game that I think they should consider. First this game is really addicting and fun to play. Collecting stickers and tokens is neat, and collecting other little stuff is fun too. It keeps the game interesting.  I don’t necessarily like the idea that we have to wait an hour just for a few dice. To me 15 mins for a few, sounds more reasonable. A whole hour just seems too much. In the game you barely get a chance to earn dice and if you do, it’s only a little bit.  With the stickers they like to give you a lot that you already have. Seeing multiples of the same one doesn’t seem fair.   Other than that this game is cool!",Addicting game
4,2023-09-07 06:21:09,This review is not about the game. It’s actually about how many times this game pops up as an ad when I’m playing other games in the fact that you have to close this pop-up out 4× to Close out from your screen. It’s super super annoying. These guys are desperate for money that they make you close the ad out four times before it disappears,Ads

No update on dice caps. I’m on map level 234 and it costs over $12billion to complete. That cannot be acquired when you can only max roll x5 or x10. Pretty much pointless to play this now.

It does pass the time but I feel as though they could do better with earning more dices… There way to many opportunities to get cash during game play but few to none for dice. Why does it take an hour to receive 8 free dice, but cash is given instantly when you roll the dice. Went bankrupt over 120million won it back with an hour.

4,2023-08-23 12:01:11,The game is fun but the developers need to change the fact that people that are NOT on your friends list can do a Bank heist! We know the game bots are doing it. But us as actual players can only do a heist on our ‘friends’. Then y’all have the nerve to wipe us out! Just a random not taking multimillions!

But besides that this game is fun.,Wish we could trade golds
2,2023-07-30 15:52:31,This game was fun in the beginning. It was easy to get or trade 1 to 3 stickers. Four and five star sticker cards are hard to get and trade. Some people scam you for the 5 sticker cards. You are forced to spend money to buy dice if you want to continue to to earn 4/5 star stickers. Seven dice an hour is a joke. You should at least be able to replenish your dice to your maximum. Even 80 dice doesn’t last long. It was fun while it lasted.

Keep up the great work!,Great game
1,2023-09-09 11:29:10,"Beginning of The game is extremely fun and addicting to play with friends and nothing beats OG monopoly. However this game is a huge money grab, they want you to spend a ton on in app purchases towards dice. You used to get 100 dice per friend that joins from Facebook and now they reduced it down to 10 so we can “better strategize and gain insightful tips” plus only being able to trade 3 stickers per day. You only gain 5-7 free dice rolls per hour. Plus they spam you with duplicate stickers and are unable to complete albums for more dice.",Fun/addicting but absolute money grab

Nothing changes… The packs are wack… You get the same duplicates over and over… Fun at first, but now, not so much… Over 180 days to complete the album yet most people are still trying to complete the album for the first time… Boo Monopoly… Boo…",I changed my mind

4,2023-07-24 14:24:01,Love the game but I think length and time for dice to return is too long and not enough dice.  I think when we win things and they are dice I think it should be a little more than you all give. If you are a person struggling you couldn’t play this game.

It’s skipping giving you the suitcases/ rafts or whatever piece that correlates with the theme at the top when you get close to a large quantity of dice. It’s also not giving chocolate when you land on it. Not to mention the entire time that I’ve been playing this game I’ve noticed that monopoly miscounts the dice rolls & place you where they want so that it’s harder to win. I spend money sometimes to play and this type of gaming is deceptive & not at all fair to your customers. THIS TOM FOOLERY NEEDS TO BE STOPPED ASAP MONOPOLY GO!,Not fun anymore
1,2023-09-08 01:01:09,"I enjoyed this game at first. However, there have been so many negative changes it is not even worth my time anymore. 8 dice per hour is laughable. How do you expect players to be able to make any progress in the game? Most competitions are only 24 hours, which is at most 240 dice. The gold stickers on every pack is ridiculous. I have 7 packs currently only missing the golds. It’s solely a pay to play game now with absurd prices. You’ll end up losing players if you don’t change things. It is evident that we are unhappy.",Over it.
1,2023-09-06 16:11:12,I have emailed and posted here and Facebook no answers. I’m 2407 in my level stars if that helps. Played constantly since may and in early June it glitched and I can’t get passed a train robbery on julieta’s bank. Really liked the game but since I’ve removed game and reinstalled multiple times with no success I’m very disappointed. I have friends who mention they started or enjoy game. So I tell them my story to let them know that I doubt the game will last. Yes I spent some money but not a lot to play.  Not good service from the game developers,Glitching since early June
5,2023-08-27 14:34:16,"I think the game is very fun and addicting. Could use some changes. I think there should be more way to play with friends. I also think we need to see new sticker notifications. Maybe after receiving new stickers they’re highlighted for a period of time, so they’re easier to find.",Great game
4,2023-09-02 13:54:12,"When I first started playing I didn’t think it would be any fun, but I’m super addicted to it now. I really just wish dice were easier to come by. I couldn’t complete the last card album and I can’t keep enough dice to rack up on anything. Super frustrating. It would be wonderful if you could buy dice with the monopoly cash…. Or earn more dice somehow.",Addictive game

1,2023-08-27 01:30:28,The person over the game designed it just to rob you of money and take away the fun in the game. we have 45 days to acquire 189 stickers and they keep giving you the same stickers and the only way to get new stickers you have to buy the guaranteed pack. we have 4 days or so left on this pack. if the new board is anytjing like this one. i will delete it. it is crazy because people are actually selling stickers on ebay and the trade group for sticker you just are getting scammed. so this is a no win game unless you spend money,Stickers
2,2023-08-24 00:07:42,This game does not give any opportunity to excel and win unless you spend money lots of money….. I am not opposed to spending money to an extent….. this is a game and should have opportunities for those who play everyday meet the deadlines and still can get stickers or win tournaments without dropping hundreds of dollars to multiply your roll to get advancement….. i spent about 200 dollars in 2 weeks and no advancement in anything ….. Its time to call it QUITS…. Which stinks i enjoyed playing the game with friends,Disappointing
1,2023-08-22 23:22:08,"This game preys on addiction culture and gets worse the longer you play. The updates or lack there of, don’t consider how many are playing and spending real dollars. They continue their greedy pursuit of money by making it incredibly difficult to finish the album, even after spending. Instead of making the game more equitable once they recognized its success.

3,2023-08-20 17:58:33,I don’t understand why you are allowed to get extra cards for the gold star cards and they can’t even be traded. Also why do we keep getting the same 1-3 star cards over and over again?

What gives???,Game is fun but a lot of the same stickers

Also whenever a heist is done the amounts don’t equal to what was actually stolen like the system adds inflation in the game.

5,2023-07-28 10:34:39,I’m a huge fan of the game monopoly! Through out my plays i have realized a few challenges. I would like to suggest an increase in dices after completing each level from 50 dices to 100 dices because it’s a bit challenging to complete each level and to attain only 50 is not worth it.,Suggestion

3,2023-07-14 04:40:09,I play this game faithfully and I hate that it starts over like you’re a new player. Let the days add up for those that play everyday. Getting a little bit of dice at day 1 over and over is not fair especially when you have been playing for a while. Change it so our tenure can add up and give us more dice for each day!

2,2023-06-09 13:29:34,"First of all the game is mildly interesting at best. You can play it for about 10 minutes before you run out of dice roles and they pester you non-stop to buy more. Additionally the game play is flat. All you really can do is auto roll dice and occasionally click on an opponent’s board to try and steal money. The money upgrades your board, which from what I can tell doesn’t really do much other than give you a different board. The pop ups and to buy more rolls are absolutely brutal.",Boring money grab

The thing is… it’s so hard to succeed in any of the special games or win any extra dice. It’s definitely a pay to win game which is popular now. I’ve paid multiple time for extra dice and it’s still impossible to win extra things like shields and fun accessories. Such a shame that all the games have to be like this.,Fun but…
1,2023-10-12 12:35:29,Whenever there’s a special event you’ll more than likely not have enough rolls to get the bigger prizes or you’ll roll 100 times and only land on those tiles like 4 times when you should have like a 30% chance at least. Overall it helps pass the time but will get boring/annoying very quickly. Also they give you cards to complete albums to win prizes but it seems like even that’s rigged.

4,2023-08-29 18:49:41,Game is very fun and addicting but once you start spending money you get nothing in return I’m almost finished with the second stickers i spent 50$ to receive the last card i needed from a guaranteed missing sticker pack and was given the duplicate was promised missing items back and nothing … games fun never spend money it’s a rip off,Do not buy packs
4,2023-08-29 14:43:04,"As much as I love this game it is definitely a pay to play. I cannot get the stickers I need to complete the set and it is very frustrating.

I wish there were more ways to get rolls and stickers.",Pay to play game
3,2023-08-29 04:06:01,This game would be awesome if it wasn’t set for us to loose like literally it only send u duplicate cards you don’t get enough dice in a day to even complete tournaments tbe group they refer you to isn’t helpful at all the only way to succeed in this game is spending your real life cash to purchase dice which isn’t enough it’s not worth it when you hav to come out your pocket to play this game is built to take your money and for you to loose,Scammy
5,2023-08-21 05:55:22,4 stars because can’t trade gold cards please allow to trade gold cards all the time this is the second that I have found that’s doesn’t allow you to to trade gold cards so please make it so we can trade gold cards all the time and not just a specific gold card all gold cards please.,Gold Cards

3,2023-08-17 18:22:20,The game is good. Few things to change. As you advance levels the completion awards should go up since the price of building goes up. Eventually 50 spins does nothing for you. There should be gold card trade days for certain cards like coin master does. The sticker game is rigged and unfair. The game doesn’t come with a disclosure saying you must pay for better stickers. The board repeats itself once you get to around 123.,Stickers
2,2023-08-13 00:47:28,"This is a really fun game, but some things NEED to change. There should be an in-game trading system where both parties should have to put their sticker into and then approve for the trade to go through. This would eliminate all scams. Also, if I spend 1500 stickers then I should not receive a GOLD sticker that I already have and can’t trade or get anything with. Such a waste of time and effort. A gold sticker should only be able to be obtained once in the game if there is no value for them.",Fun game
4,2023-05-26 14:31:03,I love this game but getting new stickers for the album is a little harder than it should be and also when you trade in your multiple stickers and you get a new pack of stickers you could at least give us a new sticker instead of repeat stickers we just got rid of. If you fix that I’ll change it to 5 stars,Fun but could improve
2,2023-08-06 22:09:14,Was addicting at first but at some point you have to pay to progress well (you can do it without it but will take forever) also don’t like the fact that I logged out at 1.7m$ needed 700k more to finish my current board but alas was out of dice and only option was to purchase or wait an hour for 5 dice. Then log back in to try and get my last bit of money and I was down 1m they need to change that. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars,Ehh

Even if your lucky enough to finish a tournament you get nothing but duplicate gold cards. The daily treats and daily task treats are a joke.

Next, the stickers… what a joke… it’s pointless to keep getting the same stickers. The vaults are useless too.  Next, the dice… that’s a joke in itself as well. Only 50 dice for a board completion??? We already get screws over by not getting the exact board spaces we rolled (I have video proof of that happening). Lastly, the events.. bogus as can be.

The game with the reward and dice system is not great and needs vast improvements. You will burn through dice so much with the lack of numbers not adding up.

You don’t even notice when you collect houses, in the Build tab, and they just get plopped on the board without you deciding. Everything moves so fast. All you do is keep pushing the red button while you keep winning money they give you so many free dice in the beginning to get you hooked and then you quickly run out on day two there is no challenge. I can play it with my toes. It’s good if you’re only looking for a quick dopamine boost.","No point, no challenge"
1,2023-08-02 11:30:53,This is the worst gaming experience. The game got boring fast. So I submitted TWO TICKETS to have my account deleted and they declined both time. Horrible customer service. Now I’m stuck with a game I absolutely hate. I uninstalled the game and still get notifications. Horrible!   Actually just submitted a 3rd help desk ticket for account deletion. I have been battling getting my account deleted for almost a month. I feel like they are holding me hostage to game me nor my friends play anymore.,Do not download!!! Horrible - They won’t let you delete your account
4,2023-07-31 22:26:08,The game is super fun but please don’t keep it a pay to play type of game make the time shorter on waiting for rolls and it would be fun to be able to click on your friends profile and see what board they’re on it’s also be fun to kind of have a mode where we can play monopoly together on the same board,Please fix the time on waiting for rolls
1,2023-07-30 02:52:47,"Don’t let the flashing lights and casino-style sounds fool you, this game is designed to manipulate you into the feeling that you are only one lucky roll away from a great prize while dangling it just outside of your reach. Limited time packs, limited time events, “free” items by linking personal accounts (which cannot be un-linked), and a TON of ads that only start showing up when you begin to run out of resources. It’s like this game was designed in a lab for the sole purpose of getting people hooked on gambling.","Addictive, obtrusive, and full of bugs"
1,2023-07-28 18:23:19,I've played this game since June 2023 and I'm at level 3694. I've received numerous sticker packs and every time I've opened one they're all duplicates of what I already have. I purchased a $50 pack yesterday and during the whole time I was rolling and receiving stickers I only got ONE new card. You guys need to do better. We shouldn't have to spend every dollar we have in order to try to get what we need to complete our sticker albums. The gold stickers should be sendable if we're going to be getting more than one.,Poor Rewards

Otherwise the program  takes over and gives you what it wants. Often s space less then what the dice showed.  The ai takes over and puts your piece where it wants you to land.  In other words, THEY MANIPULATE YOUR GAME as they see fit.  I will not put anymore of my $$ into this. It’s not a fair game.",It’s … okay

Please fix ASAP. I just know I lost everything 😭. Soon as it’s fixed I’ll put 5 stars. The error message I get says “ Your Request Couldn't be Processed There was a problem with this request.

5,2023-10-29 00:31:56,Hello firstly i’d like to say that i love this game obviously but the one thing that i really don’t understand is the stickers they just seriously keep giving me the same ones over and over no matter what kind of trade in i do or even colored sticker packets i think yall should make it more fair on stickers.,stickers
1,2023-11-01 17:25:23,I am only rating this 1 stars in hopes this gets someone’s attention. I have looked for a way to contact them and cannot find anything. The game keeps crashing over and over again giving an error message. The game is completely unplayable right now. This crash is keeping me from winning the current tournament as I am in second place right behind the leader but cannot progress… Too bad cause it was a fun game.

2,2023-11-01 17:16:21,Getting mad the fact the we are  less than 3 hours from this event and now everything we are trying to do something it says an error. I’m sure there are a lot of other people on the game right now trying to win the 5000 dice. But come on this is ridiculous and we have been playing and playing and now the game wants to act up in the final stretch and we are all going to loose our in this because of an error,Getting mad
1,2023-10-29 12:09:22,"The pop-up windows are relentless. Every time you open the game or run out of rolls, they are pushing so hard for your money. I get that they are trying to get as many micro transactions as possible, but this is annoying. Plus, I thought it would be more similar to actual monopoly. It’s just a dice rolling simulator and you get to watch your piece move around the board. “Heists” and “Shut downs” don’t actually do all that much to your friends when you attack them. It’s honestly kinda pointless….",Pop-up window closing simulator.

Well done app/game creators 👏,Monopoly Go
1,2023-10-25 15:56:59,I’m about to delete this game the higher the level goes it cost more we don’t get enough dice for the higher levels but I guess that’s where the trick comes in at to get you addicted to the game then you start spending your money to play I love playing the game but you only get little of dice to play and if you multiple to get bigger prizes the quicker your dice leave also completing cards they give you the same cards over and over again it’s a cool game I just think it’s a rip off after awhile,Money and dice
5,2023-10-14 00:28:49,So I originally got this game because friends were recommending it at first I thought it was gonna be boring but now I’m addicted is really fun it’s worth the five stars and it’s really fun and awesome. I will recommend it to all my friends and family and associates and classmates even teachers.,I got this game cause friends recommended it !
5,2023-10-07 13:40:13,I love it but….not enough rewards when they inconvenience you with technical difficulties on they’re part and when you level up it doesn’t increase the rewards it stays the same even though you are spending your hard earned money to play the game,Sam

Over a period of 30 days, I’ve gotten over 20 dupe golds. This is how that game works. I have 7k dice sitting on my game from the competition win and I’m not even interested in the game anymore.

5,2023-09-19 21:35:41,This game was able to bypass passcodes and charge on 3 occasions  $1.99. When I reached out to monopoly they said speak to apple.

I have never made any in app purchases and I have the feature disabled so how did this game by pass it?!,In app charges unauthorized
4,2023-10-05 23:31:12,I’m enjoying the game. But it’s crazy how you work hard to complete game packs and they give you double of the stickers you can’t trade. We have 3 days to finish the sticker pack and gosh you can’t even buy a pink sticker pack. Let come on at least make a box to open to trade the extra gold stickers for ones you need or something,Stickers
3,2023-10-05 18:08:22,Game started out fun but it’s hard to get dice or new cards I only seem to get new cards when I finish the quick wins. And when I hit the wheel boost it’s always the safe same plain cards and money it’s getting tiring.

3,2023-10-05 12:06:12,"The game is a lot of fun, but there’s definitely areas that need to be improved on like the daily dice rolls barely get you enough to be able to compete in any of the daily events.

It takes a hour to get 5 spins this is crazy. They have so many events to compete in you need dice rolls or you won’t win anything.

And even when you pay you don’t get what you need. This gone used to be fun. Now it’s just infuriating!!!!! You took away any chance of winning without paying. You dropped the free dice to almost nothing on the small sticker packs and don’t give out the stickers on the larger packs. The team games used to be fair spins but now 20 out of 25 spins you get 300 or less.   I officially hate this game now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Rigged

It would be cooler if you could turn Monopoly money into dice rolls. It’s too difficult to advance now. It’s taken all the fun out of the game. You should also offer more dice for completing landmarks as you go up in level. Why am on levels 100+ but still only getting 50 dice for completely boards??????

1,2023-09-02 13:31:38,I have been playing this game for about 2 months now. In the recent weeks I find that the higher I get on the boards the more glitches I encounter. I have contacted customer support and they always respond with a canned answer asking me the same question that I posed to them. If you are close to completing a task within the game you get error messages and when the game reboots the event is over and you don’t advance. Very addictive and fun game just has some flaws that is causing me consider withdrawing from the game altogether.,Glitchy
4,2023-08-28 17:58:22,Great game to play with family & friends or just to play period. My only complaint is how many repetitive stickers there are also it would be great to be able to maybe have a chat with your friends in the game about trading stickers.

For over a month now I have been trying to get the same sticker and it’s bad enough that the gold stickers come few and far between but now the regular sticker are even hard to get. Also you shouldn’t be able to get multiple gold stickers if they can’t be traded.

Or all the microtransaction shoved in your face as soon as you open the game. 3-4 different in app purchases that grant you dice, stickers, cash, or all of the above.  The game is fun though. It just seems very heavily pointed toward buying their products to expedite your experience. You obviously don’t HAVE to buy anything. When you get notifications that someone robbed you or that someone took down you structure and the only way to get more shields is to land on them but you don’t have any rolls left? Seems like a purchase is in order  TL;DR  Game IS fun. Definitely very micro transaction oriented",Pay to [almost] win: the mobile game
3,2023-07-25 16:31:24,I actually love playing the game. It’s a great game for a quick play on your down time. However to continue getting HUNDREDS of the SAME CARD is absurd. I also feel as though once we’ve passed the 100 on the map we should get 100 rolls instead of the same 50. The entire country is playing this game right now & completing sticker books shouldn’t be this complicated.,Raise the Rolls & give less repeated stickers
1,2023-07-21 17:56:46,"There isn’t really an overarching goal or anything to play towards and when you upgrade the buildings they don’t really do anything. It felt like the same thing over and over and I only made it to the third map. Not much to do outside of rolling and upgrading. Other games like coc and sim city at least have some level of interaction outside of just upgrading and those games progression system shows significant visual changes as you progress. Don’t waste your time, felt like my brain was turning to mush while playing.",Brain Rot
5,2023-07-17 09:13:57,Best mobile game so far I love the little cut scenes and stuff should make more of them like acting out the chance cards or something along the lines it would make it more interesting than it really is which probably is uncalled for because the games super fun already thanks for creating it!!!!,Review 5/5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,2023-07-10 20:27:22,"The update is a scam. The update basically is to gather any information from your phone. They make you play the game at first and afterwards they make you update it in which they gather any personal information from your phone like credit card info, bank, notes, etc.",Scam
5,2023-07-09 17:45:23,"I could play this game all day if I never had to pay. Pressing the button down for a few seconds, and my little car takes off by itself throughout the board. I get a kick out of all the rail roads too, and collecting more money that way. So many ways to earn money in this game. Love it! RACHEL W.",Monopoly
5,2023-07-06 17:00:03,"I normally like this game, but here lately every time I open it, the app crashes and takes forever to load. I’ve updated the app and it still crashes. If this is going to be an issue that keeps happening, I’ll delete the game and find another free time game to play",Not worth it
1,2023-07-06 17:59:29,"I used to really like this game. But I need to know what’s going on with my account. I still can’t get in beyond that Community Chest. Yesterday, I was at level 3838. Today I try to get in and I’m at level 3812?! What’s going on? I am close to deleting this game permanently and I wished that I could ask for a refund for all the money I’ve dropped while playing this game.  And then when I go to Support, they ask me for a member ID I can’t even get to. This is the worst customer service I’ve ever seen in a game.",Stuck at Community Check and lost 20 levels
3,2023-07-06 17:11:06,I love the game! However there are not enough chances to gain rolls if you aren’t paying money for more rolls you don’t stand a chance in the competitions and. Also ever since the introduction of the new cake game (which is awesome) it has been nothing but glitches and errors! I received a little gift saying sorry about the bugs and the glitches became ten times worse to the point that the game is unplayable!,Great but big issues
5,2023-04-23 01:20:35,It reminds me of a game I used to play called coin blast but it’s had a lot of ads but since I love monopoly and coin blast it both with out ads. I love the concept of the game. Please what ever you do as the creators of this game. Please don’t give us ads after every play. That will kill your game,I really like this game because of no adds
4,2023-07-05 20:24:43,"I have had this game for a few weeks now and spent more money than I’d like, but that’s on me. It is very fun when it is working. However the last two events that happened I was pushed out of the top ten due to the game not loading. I believe that robbed of hundreds of dice. I know it was at least 200 dice on this last one.   It would be nice if there was some compensation for rewards that were missed due to game issues. I did update my game as soon as the update was available too.   I will continue to play, but am weary now to try too hard as it may result in missing out on things due to the game not loading.   Always a Monopoly fan!","Fun, but buggy"
2,2023-06-07 20:13:53,"The biggest downfall to this game is they don’t give you enough lives, and the ones that they do, you go through quickly, so they hound you to buy them. After like an hour, they will give you five lives, but you can go through that in like a minute and then you have to wait another hour. It honestly makes you lose interest. They could at least let you watch adds to keep going or upgrade monthly to keep going.",Downfall
4,2023-05-30 14:20:26,Game plays itself for the most part. Pretty entertaining when you have a bit of time to kill.  There are a bit too many ads and pop ups and it feels a bit money grabby.  Not having a Facebook makes the multiplayer very mediocre. There’s not really any ways to play with friends outside of the occasional fake interaction with their board.,Ok game
4,2023-05-15 21:42:42,The game is awsome but I wish there was a better way to earn dice like a mini game or some cool other part of the game to help you progress just that way I can play for more than 2 minutes every hour. If they added something like this I would rate it a 5 star game but I just wish I could get dice easier and play longer. But a good game overall.🤩,The game is awsome
5,2023-11-08 04:18:17,"This game is genuinely addicting. I have never consistently played a mobile game to this degree, let alone with friends. It’s fun, however, much like the board game, it brings out a competitive side in whomever plays it. It will make or break whatever friendship or relationship you have, solely for the need to win",Be careful!
1,2023-11-11 06:37:21,This developer isn’t getting another dime from me. I lost so much money and dice from those glitches and was inches from finishing the tournament despite that (and would have if the game was working properly). And we were rewarded with what? A measly 200 dice as a sorry after all the money I spent? Multiple inquiries through their “chat”… that was a joke. Plus it’s impossible to complete the cards without relying on other players and hoping they won’t screw you over. The game is rigged and impossible and unfair.,Not another dime!
3,2023-11-08 08:26:48,I have 3 starts bc yes the game can be fun but it’s so hard to get stickers. I’ve had like 15 of the same card more than once. And also it’s so dumb when I take the time to save up stars I get a box just to get the same cards? That’s pathetic! I haven’t been playing as much bc I have no more ambition. It’s hard to get cards. The price of die is WAY too high to even want to buy any either!,I gave 3 starts because
4,2023-11-05 15:17:51,I love playing this game it’s super fun to play with friends and to pass time. The only issue is the amount of pop up ads are absurd. Once you run out of dice you have to close out of multiple pop up adds every time. There are also random pop up ads just while playing the game.,Fun but too many pop up adds
3,2023-11-05 14:17:32,"For the contest/competition need to be grouped better if somebody is able to get 10,000 of the badges he should be in a group wit other people able to instead of a group wit people who barley getting 3,000 in second it makes no sense and it could be a bit winning all the contest just fix the game instead of profiting cuz y’all got enough of my money and I’m not winning or making progress",Algorithm
3,2023-11-03 04:29:05,Used to be fun but now the only way to enjoy the game is by spending money on VERY expensive packs ranging from $50-$100 to get dice. Without dice you won’t be able to win any challenges and get the stickers you need. They give the same 1-3 star stickers and you can trade but hardly anyone wants to or they scam you. The greed is ridiculously apparent and it’s making the game less and less enjoyable,Greed
3,2023-11-01 17:54:50,I love this game!! But the update has some bugs! For some reason I cannot move to the next board. Every time I got to pay for the last build on the current board I get an error message and the game restarts to where I have to pay for the last build. It lets me roll dice play the partner games and everything else but will not let me move to the next board. So frustrating!,Errors
1,2023-11-02 19:45:35,Wats 8 dice go do for ppl like let’s be honest here and stop giving us ppl the same dang stickers . Like y’all literally giving us the same stickers through out the whole event . Yes I know you ppl to spend money which I have spent money before but honestly it’s not worth it . I’m not abt spend 9.99 plus tax just for a couple hundred dice.. I feel like for someone to spend 9.99 plus tax den Dey should be able to get 1000+ plus dice and that go make ppl want to spend money .. please fix this so ppl can keep enjoying playing the game,Come on know
1,2023-11-01 17:32:13,I have been playing this game for a while and never had issues and recently I had lots of money in the bank and my game would error and have to reopen the app and it did it upwards of 10 times before i quit and restarted my phone and then again it happened another 10-15 times and in that time I got most of my money heisted. I could’ve completed at least 2 board with what I had and now i don’t even want to play the game if it’s just going to cheat you out of playing!,Fix it!
5,2023-10-17 01:26:09,"I just started, and it’s already a fun game! I downloaded because some family members started playing. It’s fun because you can pick it up and play for just a minute because there’s not much to it. Great for when you have a few minutes of free time here and there.",Great game!
4,2023-11-01 17:20:48,I love this game so so much but I want to give it four stars because every time I go to the next world it always says an error is happen the game is it supposed to reset the game even though there is no errors I try again it says the same thing. Can you stop with the error thing I almost deleted monopoly go so stop it.,I love this game but
3,2023-10-30 20:08:45,"My only problem with the game is when yo  uh do win a tournament in the top 10 and don’t get your prizes, besides that the sticker issue, so many copies over and over. Only needed 6 stickers for the last event for a couple weeks and got nothing but copies. But then you offer a guaranteed sticker if we buy a pack from you. Not fair especially if we have already spent money",Not getting my tournament prizes
3,2023-10-26 22:09:50,This game is fun. I love that you don't have to watch advertisements like some app games. However there are a few things I don't like about the  game: 1. You get the same stickers over & over so it's hard to complete a collection. 2. You cannot help your friends by giving them dice. 3. The offers (you can purchase) pop up every time you open the game.,Fun but you can help your friends
1,2023-10-18 11:04:45,"They’ll give you cards for a set you already completed. You have to wait 11 hours before you get all your dice to roll. Your subject to attacks from everyone that plays, not just your friends. Minimal rewards are repetitive. Prize money for completing boards becomes pennies compared to what you need to upgrade a single landmark. This game is amazing and addictive, as long as you know you will never reach the major rewards. You get duplicate gold cards, you can’t even trade gold cards. Why get a duplicate?",Carrot on a stick
5,2023-10-14 02:47:15,Ok so my friends have been telling me to get this game and I finally decided to download it and when I do I get addicted I cannot get off of this and I’m loving every second of it. I’ve had it for 30 minutes and I’m already level 60. All and all it is the best game ever!!!!!10/10,One of the best games ever
3,2023-10-15 20:59:39,"why is it that someone i’m not friends with can keep attacking me (targeting me) over and over and over again but i can only “get revenge” on them ONCE and i try to click on my “friends” and he’s not on there, only he can attack me but i can’t attack him?? seems unfair. And when i go try to unadd him it won’t let me! he won’t stop and it’s making me want to delete the app at that point.",big issue
5,2023-09-30 14:39:46,"This is a really fun game that you can play when you only have a short amount of time!! Some games seem to lock you in forever but I love that you can pop in play a few rounds, move up your levels and be on your way. I definitely recommend!!",Spectacular fun!!
1,2023-10-13 15:51:45,I recently accidentally clicked a form to delete my account because I thought it was a form to get my money back because of some glitch. And now it says my account is in the process of being deleted. Cant find any help from scopely and now my account is going to be deleted all because I was trying to get my money back. I was so far into this game and now it’s all gone. Very disappointing because I was really enjoying this game. Please someone help before my account is gone!!!!,Going to lose my account
3,2023-10-03 02:18:06,I like the game but what I don’t like about it is how when you get sticker packs it’s the same ones. Also sometimes when you share your link to invite someone to play with you it doesn’t give you the dice that you are supposed to get. And we shouldn’t have to pay for anything with our own money we should be able to use the money we collect in the game.,Monopoly Go
3,2023-10-02 17:42:13,"The game is pretty addicting and everyone I know is playing. Rating 3 stars because I was 100 away from reaching 1st place in the tournament. There was 20 minutes left so I spent $10 on some dice so I could finish in 1st place. They took my money, but didn’t give me my dice! My first time buying dice and definitely won’t try again. Had to spend the last 20 minutes on hold with apple for my refund. Super irritated",Meh
5,2023-09-24 23:59:18,Why be attack by the same person over and over again especially when you’re not friends with the person but constantly attacking every second to minute,Problem
1,2023-09-29 14:46:37,"Just a suggestion, keep the game fun! You guys are rich already $5 for 20 dice is crazy. It’s fun trading stickers and interacting with other players, perhaps focus on that. Team building exercises are fun too but they’re unrealistic and too expensive sometimes. This game has been manipulated too much. Other wise, it’s a good game. If not for the piece gouging, would be a 5 star game.  Update: gave 3 stars before, changed it to 1. They cap the dice but there’s no cap to how much people can rob you. This brilliant game is no longer fun and not able to be played. Deleting","Good game, but"
4,2023-09-28 19:07:16,My game been showing me for three weeks. Every time I open to play it shows me a error. I deleted re-downloaded and it shows me the same. I don’t know what’s wrong with it don’t know where to write to or who can help me if anybody knows where I could get help for this let me know please thank you,I’ll give it a four star rating because
5,2023-09-08 04:43:36,"Since the second gave started there seems to be more prizes of dice and cards which is nice. However, I’ve been playing the railway riches tournament and today all of my “wins” quit registering. It makes the sound that it’s supposed to but I’m not getting the credit. Very disappointed.",Glitching
2,2023-09-21 22:18:57,"The game was very addicting at first. I could stay off of it.. I gave it two starts just because at some point I enjoyed the game. As you go on, it become harder to get dice or stickers to complete the pack. It’s like a money thing and to those who don’t mind putting money into the game then have it! But there should be way more dice then 7 or 8 a hour that’s forcing you to spend money if your addicted to the game.. will be deleting! Have fun while you can",Not fun anymore
3,2023-09-20 10:03:31,Each event no matter if it’s the 4 corners or tax spots or train. When the events are happening for one of those 3 my rolls for those never happen. Yet i will constantly hit the ones I needed for the previous. Are the rolls based on percentage and ratios and when the events happen are changed to make those specific spots harder to land on? Cause if so make it very clear cause it ain’t worth playing if that’s the case.,Explain.
1,2023-09-16 11:59:23,It was fun at first and then they started getting money hungry. The just wanted us to spend more and more money without any actual rewards. They made it harder to get gold cards and are constantly giving repeats of all the cards you already have. I would’ve spent more money if it would’ve stayed as fun as before. They’re eventually going to lose a lot of customers and are doing nothing to keep them. It’s a money grabbing scheme for them without any smidge of satisfaction for most of its customers.,It was fun at first
4,2023-09-07 18:29:23,"Overall the game is awesome!  There a some “bugs” they really need to fix. The game crashes, glitches or freezes. I’ve not gotten certain rewards because of said issues. Also I have a few unauthorized purchases in my game and I tried to reach out to support to avail. Be that as it May the game is fun and helps me pass time.",Game had me in a chokehold
1,2023-09-08 04:29:47,Game was so fun at first. Everything was great until the new sets came out making it unobtainable to achieve the goals set in place unless your spending real $$ to complete tasks. Sure we have all paid for games but the amount of $$ they are asking for extra dice is unheard of!  Recently I have been getting error messages when I finally get something I needed and the app closes out without the gift being given but the dice were taken. Customer service is nonexistent nor do they ever reply.,Game has gone downhill!
5,2023-09-03 00:12:14,"This game is one of my favorites, it is so fun. I would totally recommend it. You can add friends and make new friends. It doesn’t seem so much like the board game Monopoly, but it is GREAT! You earn money and spend money to unlock new landmarks and maps. Also you can unlock new characters. Create an avatar, and enjoy! I RECOMMEND THIS GAME!",Such a fun game
5,2023-08-22 20:53:10,I think this game is so awesome and so much fun you can play against you friends and family I would recommend playing it. I enjoy playing it with my family because it is a great game and I love it so much. I play against my family and it is so much fun. Once again I recommend playing it.,Best Game Made
1,2023-09-01 03:01:16,"They don’t honor the bets you make (Ex you roll x10 and you win thirty dice = you only get thirty) same with other wins. Then, I left the game this afternoon (on same device without looking out) with $75+mil in the bank and no property built on my next level. I came back to a completely new board and zero dollars in the account with no explanation  in the breakdown of fees or what other players took. I’ve spent over $50 on this game and it’s a complete scam. I did try reaching out to their help desk about it but, it only goes in circles with no resolution.",Unreliable
3,2023-08-25 13:40:06,I like the game overall but it’s extremely to hard to finish the sticker album and I feel as if we should be able to gift the gold stickers as well. I need to hold stickers to finish the album with only six  days left and all I’m getting out of the card packs are duplicates. It’s getting ridiculous and starting become not fun anymore !! Make more dice available as well,Minor adjustments
3,2023-08-24 00:35:09,"I think the game is fun, it’s a new twist on an old classic. BUT the amount of pop-ups that the end user is presented is making me stop playing. There needs to be something to turn off the offers the game constantly presents. One offer that pops up would be fine but just now, I opened the app and I needed to close out of SEVEN pop-ups asking me to spend money before I could even roll the dice 🤬",Fun but Annoying
5,2023-08-07 05:20:16,"I think this game is fun and interesting. It doesn’t have any ads and it’s just like the regular monopoly but you can buy stuff and make your own cities like I have like no words this is such a good game. Totally recommend it if you are a monopoly person. You should totally play this game, so yeah, have a good time.",Fun game
1,2023-08-21 21:54:22,"I LOVED this game until I had my entire account drained by a bot with no way to contact the creators to give an incident report. I was actively playing the game and using rolls I paid for to build my $$ for about 10 minutes, had my account entirely drained in one swoop by a player I can’t find or get revenge on, and have to completely start from scratch. I’ve never had a heist amounting close to what they took from me. I think it’s a scam. Don’t recommend getting sucked into this game. It’s really fun until it’s not.",Get ready for frustration
3,2023-08-19 02:39:02,"Sigh… If you don’t mind being addicted to a game that requires pay to play and has no owner oversight.. This is for you. The rewards in NO WAY compensate for what you have to put into it. Scammers abound! I’m on level 12,759 as I write this. Map 357… and It’s costing about 140 BILLION to complete a location. However the reward for completing is still 50 dice. If that isn’t a scam then I don’t know what is. Now I’m off to beg for some stickers since I have no dice :-(.",Wth
5,2023-07-29 18:11:41,I love the Facebook and contact friends and fam that I could potentially come in contact with within gameplay. The concept of the different boards and structures you build and yet still remember that this here is Monopoly! Very addicting and even better that I can refer people to join in on the fun!,Fun and very interactive!
5,2023-07-18 19:09:12,"I recently learned how to play monopoly on the board and I love it, just to have it on the phone and play with people online is fun as well.

2,2023-07-24 20:42:08,I was on board 82 when I mistakenly uninstalled the app. Reached out to customer service via chat and in game app 2 days straight! Received the same response that someone would follow up with me within 24 hours about restoring my old account since I was logged into Facebook. No response and still no changes. Seems like there isn’t even any live people via chat since I always get the same generic response.,Lost game progress- no help from Customer service
5,2023-07-12 00:20:06,"Was enjoy the game until I started noticing how much scams are out there and some even sell stickers off eBay , so they definitely won’t trade because they want to hoard the stickers and sell on eBay .. it’s becoming a big problem because they even scam people out of stickers just to sell",Security
3,2023-07-16 17:10:50,I did a tournament and got first place but didn’t receive any of the prizes I thought we’ll maybe it’s a glitch good thing I took a picture for proof because it never gave me anything no dice or even sticker pack nor the cash.. and it’s not like I can reach out to customer support because it’s strictly articles.. please can a dev fix this issue or even send the tournament prizes (I have screenshots),Would’ve Been 5 stars
5,2023-07-10 12:10:52,I think this is a great app and it has really brought more family and friends together!!! My only issue is that we should be able to message each other on the actual game!!! Especially when adding people you don’t know!,Messaging capabilities
2,2023-07-10 22:34:19,I have been playing this game for quite some time now and this is the first issue i’ve had with it but it’s a major one. The game keeps freezing and crashing saying i need to restart even tho my wifi is stable and no issues should be occurring for this major issue i have missed some events and been unable to play the game i will be rating based on everything but this issue will out trump everything else.,Lots of crashing
5,2023-07-10 08:33:02,I hate that my Facebook picture is permanently linked even after disconnecting from Facebook! I hate it! Can you guys change that feature like yesterday! I liked the photo that was chosen at the beginning. Thanks,Game is awful I want to change my profile picture
5,2023-06-26 01:31:57,YK this game is the BEST and it’s really fun I’ve had this game for only maybe 3-4 hours and I’m in love with it but I really want to go against people but I don’t have Facebook and you can’t make accounts with apple that’s the only thing I don’t like other than that this game is the very best and I recommend getting this game!,Amazing!!
4,2023-07-05 19:42:49,I love this game! At least I did until the latest update. The game keeps crashing with an error message saying it needs to restart and then it doesn’t restart. I tried to contact customer support and the article sent me to the in-game support. Hahaha I can’t get the game to load. So here I am. Hopefully tech support will see this and investigate. 🤞🏼,Game keeps crashing
3,2023-07-05 17:34:21,After I updated the game I can no longer access the game. It takes a very long time to load then an error message appears saying something about the connection. I have tried everything I can think of to help with the problem but hasn’t come up with a solution. I really enjoy playing this game and would love for this problem to be fixed.,Game won’t start.
4,2023-06-21 19:44:53,The game is great and very addictive without having to spend money. My only suggestion would be is to add an option to trade gold cards within the game for other gold cards of equal or lesser star value if you have doubles of them. They are harder to get so why not be able to reward yourself if you have doubles and need another gold card!!,Gold Cards
5,2023-06-08 18:38:01,"I am in love with this game, but it’s a money grabbing game and they tell you to like and follow them on Facebook to get free gifts that they never give an customer service is a complete joke, and don’t let me get started with buying dice as soon as you buy the dice you lose them I am at the point of deleting this game.",Great Game But!!!
5,2023-05-24 02:34:07,First of all if you’re gonna give copious amounts of duplicate gold stickers they should be tradable… secondly something has to be changed so it’s not as easy to be scammed. There are SO many people cheating others out of cards that we worked hard to get in the first place.,Loving this game but can we talk about Stickers?
2,2023-06-05 12:26:04,"This game was definitely a great idea. It is a very fun game to play with friends. I wish that those were the only people you could play with, instead of the entire world. The sticker packs definitely need tweaking because it is nearly impossible to finish any set because every pack has the same stickers. There needs to be an option to share more than five times with friends. This game is really set up to make people spend money.",Great concept
4,2023-05-28 01:57:12,"I got this game and I loved it, in the beginning it was really hard to get dice, now I typically have enough to play for like 30 mins give or take (which I read is everyone’s issue with the game.

Every time a try to upgrade my board the game crashes & restarts.  It’s getting annoying.  I’m sure a fix will be coming.  Still love the game.",Loving it
2,2023-05-16 17:12:43,After playing for a few weeks this is a total let down. Not sure what the shields are even for since I have to fix all of my stuff every time I get on there. Leave and I have money but when I return they have given it all away. It was fun for maybe a few days but a waste of time now. Nothing like the Original Monopoly. I wouldn’t recommend spending your money on this game since they will only give it away.,Nothing like the Original Monopoly
1,2023-04-23 18:29:03,"This game is attracting new users based on 2 factors. 1. On the name of ""Monopoly"" brand 2. People required to add ""friends"" in game to earn cetain number of people and sharing the invites  There is nothing fun in this game after understanding the mechanism. Just mindless autopilot game with hundreds of pop-ups to buy in game resources.   There is not even an iota of multiplayer (with your friends) gameplay. This seems to be a cash grab app relying on ""Monopoly"" name and nothing else. I would like to know from the developer team, what was their intention for making this game or to make it popular.   For Apple App Store:  Could you please make a feature to report such apps and show some warning on this game. Also, please check the authenticity of 5 star reviews. If they are genuine accounts and their owners are not just developers themselves or worst case bots.","Worst Game Ever, Period."

5,2023-10-18 12:13:39,I wouldn’t suggest wasting money on this game. Everything is rigged in the games favor and is set up to leave you with zero dice right before getting any milestones or prizes so you will be more inclined to spend money. Customer support is nonexistent and will not help you no matter your situation. I stand by this.,Rigged & money hungry
4,2023-10-31 15:17:26,I love this game so much. But So many of the same stickers! Also doing the events is sometimes impossible to finish. the spins at high multiplier still doesn’t raise the bar enough. I understand that you have to make it a challenge but 4 cars and having to do that in 4 days barely finishing 1 is a little crazy.,A few changes
1,2023-10-29 16:03:39,Just want to complain about this spooky car partners. 80K to complete one car and you only put 6 chances of getting wheels on the board and then the spin amounts 60 and 80??? How do you think it is possible for anyone to complete?? Are you trying to push people away from playing your game because I know a of a lot of people that have deleted this game because of how y’all do us. No new cards in MONTHS and when we do get cards they are dupes. Y’all really need to rethink y’all’s strategies!!!,I know it’s just a game but….
4,2023-10-28 18:31:32,Initially loved playing the game but slowly started noticing the game is rigged. Now I’m days they make it nearly impossible to win tournaments or events. They ask for more “points” than they use to to win said events. And I just recently bought a package through the game advertised for $20 and when I go to check my bill I was charged $40,Scam
3,2023-10-28 15:38:43,You purchase in app purchase u revive the item and then app glitches u loose progress rewards and there is no way to get them back. The most they have refunded me in app is 70 dice. But nothing for the loss of progress in the last 2 days I have lost a ton of dice progress in the competition. Repetitive rewards not worth the money to spend extra on in app purchases,To many glitches still
2,2023-10-26 00:19:47,Why?? Why?? Why?? Do you have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a gold card?? I love the game but come on! You can’t even get in first place bc as soon as it starts you have people so high there is no way of catching up!! Please fix this issue and start giving out more gold cards then thousands of the same cards! And you can’t even get a gold card from other players that has five!! Fix the issue.,Difficult to get your gold cards
5,2023-10-16 22:14:39,I am really addicted to this game & I love it!!! It would be really great if there was a way people could chat with friends during the game or even when someone is not playing at the same time as their friends then everyone could still get the message on chat.,Monopoly Go!

3,2023-10-16 19:06:59,"This game is the most amazing game ever. The trade is real with people and stuffs. Why make us love the game and then turn around to frustrate us cause of your selfish reasons of making us purchase what we’d need ordinarily?? I understand you want to make money, but this isn’t really fair… You make it so much difficult for people to play and it’s so frustrating…. You can fix this or you’d start losing people… ✌️",Dissatisfaction
4,2023-10-06 20:24:47,"This game is so addicting and so much fun- there is only one annoying aspect, you can’t share the gold cards.   Why am I getting extra gold cards if I can’t share them? Or when I am in need of other cards? I get that it’s random, but my goodness it feel like I haven’t gotten a new card in forever, I just feel stuck.",Only one annoyance
5,2023-09-04 17:56:56,"I love the entire concept of the game, I hate it takes forever to get dice, not enough mega heist, the further you advance the more dice you should get although I like you get cards now, however it would be cool to now add a chat area after you shut down/money heist ppl property lol but I love it & hate it!!!!,!,",Love it or hate it
3,2023-09-28 20:07:26,"The game won’t even load today. At all.  The 8 dice an hour is pretty ridiculous and limiting. And your token doesn’t always move the same number you roll. Like, every day my token will move less than I roll and wind me up on a space that seriously doesn’t help me.  If I can ever get the game to load to begin with, the accuracy really needs to be improved upon.",Mostly good…until today.
3,2023-09-28 14:55:04,Earlier I was playing and then it ended suddenly and claimed errors. Then when I try to open it again it takes forever just to have another error. I updated and was able to play for 5 minutes maybe and then closed out again because of errors. I love the game but so many bugs and errors.,Currently can play because of more errors.
4,2023-09-28 13:42:49,"I love this game, been playing for awhile now. Today, September 28th I haven’t been able to play because every time I start the game sends the error message saying it needs to reload.

1,2023-09-27 16:52:20,"this game was enjoyable the last album. this time around you’ll have made it almost impossible to complete albums, the duplicate stickers are insane. Not to mention the rewards for completing the albums, literally insane. The fact that we have to use all of our rolls just to ATTEMPT these tournaments and barely make it isn’t even worth it as 9/10 i’m matched with a bot who gets 15,000 the first few seconds in the tournament. Can we get a match making?! all in all this game has gone downhill",gotta do better
2,2023-09-26 00:31:18,This new album and all the changes made with it REALLY killed the trading game part of this. Last album my wife and I were able to trade things through to the end. This round we’ve literally got exactly the same cards and ONLY need the gold cards. I understand you need to make money and all that but when you remove half the purpose of the game what’s the point to even play anymore? Used to be a 4.5 star game. No longer.,Bad Season Changes.
2,2023-09-17 19:43:46,"This game was cool at first but it’s like the higher you get the less rewards your awarded. Community chest only opens up 3 or less keys now. You get massive replica cards and it’s like you gotta sweat blood and tears for a gold card that’s not right. Then when you reach higher levels you still only get the same 50 rolls, that’s not right because obviously we enjoy this game and love to play it and y’all ripping people off. I don’t know what y’all doing at Monopoly Headquarters but YALL NEED TO GET TOGETHER!",RIPPING OFF
2,2023-09-17 01:28:57,The game is fun there is no doubt about that.  It’s the every time I log in or run out of rolls the 30+ buy these for more things that pop up. It’s literally so annoying. We all know the store is there and we can buy more no need to hit us with a million spam options to buy more rolls.  Maybe 1-2 would be tolerable but holy cow. It’s so many everytime I open the app that now I’m like do I really wanna play after I spend 5 min closing pop ups in game to start,SPAM
1,2023-09-13 16:47:36,"There is way to much pressure on trying to sell more dice. I get constant pop ups just going into the game and then every single time I don’t have enough dice to do a roll multiplier or when I am out of dice. I don’t care, I’m just trying to use up dice, don’t want to buy more. I currently have 4 persistent package icons on the left that I can’t make go away that are trying to sell me more things. I get the store icon being there, that’s fine. It’s the other FOUR taking up screen space.",Too many pop ups and sale icons
3,2023-09-11 00:40:07,I love this addicting game but I do wish it were easier to get the cookies and stickers. It’s nearly impossible to get the amount needed to bake the cakes and I’ve noticed several times where I’ve landed on the cookies but have not gotten them. It’s not fun when you hardly offer any extra cookies and each spin is worth 20. It’s also kinda crazy we can’t trade the golden stickers.,Fun but could be improved
2,2023-09-08 04:38:47,"Let me start by saying this game was really fun to start with but this tournament with the cakes that’s going on right now, not so much 🥴 it hasn’t been giving me my rewards, has cheated me out of dice and doesn’t give me the “cakes” when I’m winning them, it just doesn’t add to my already amount that I have available. I’ve reached out to customer support several times with no updates on anything. I’ve Spent money but not anymore if this keeps continuing.",Don’t do it 😬
3,2023-09-07 02:31:38,"Love the game but the glitches make you not want to play. Game has been glitching for the past two days.

2,2023-09-05 14:59:05,I tried reaching out elsewhere and haven’t heard anything.   My only complaint about this game Sis that people who are not my friends are able to complete a bank heist on me. Since when did this become an option? Where was the notification of this? I understand they can shut down and I pay rent to them but having continuous people stealing my money when this wasn’t an original option I’m not with.,No other option
5,2023-08-20 21:48:54,Can you guys please set a gold card trade special? We have a little over 10 days left to complete the Wildlife Tales collection. Can this be done so we all can help one another complete the collection? A lot of us are under 10 cards away from completing it. I literally play this game EVERYDAY 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,Gold Card Trade
4,2023-08-29 20:24:30,I would give this game five stars however on certain challenges or reward games where stickers are given they should make all cards available to everyone. And all cards should be tradable. The fact you have to purchase packages for gold stickers is ridiculous. Takes away from the fun and interaction of the game.,Rate
1,2023-08-28 11:19:07,"This game is fun not going to lie but the rewards don’t add up. I think is a scam you wait 8 hrs to get 18 dice. The dice regenerates 8 dice every hour so u constantly wasting money, the difficulty in getting a gold card is incredibly hard. They false advertise “guarantee gold card*pack for 20 you buy it and all you get is duplicates of gold card you already have. I didn’t finish my sticker book but have friends that completed it 3 times in the same season something is not adding up.. I won’t be playing next season rip-off!!!",Ripoff

When they do fix the bugs and give a gift to everybody for it, they pick and choose who they give the good gifts to. I got 25 dice last time while the majority got 200 dice and a pink sticker pack. I’m over board 120 and I’m still only getting 8 dice an hour and only 50 dice for completing a board. My network is 3840 and still nothing. This is a disgrace.",Crappy game
5,2023-07-31 17:27:22,I have enjoyed this game but what I don’t like is that the Cards are mostly copies. We need new Cards!!! We’re not going to be able to win the Grand Prize if y’all don’t give new cards!!! Please do Better!! We need new cards. Instead of giving old cards y’all could give dice instead. WE NEED NEW CARDS TO WIN!!!!,Sad Player. We need New cards.
1,2023-08-03 10:51:36,At first the game was a blast. But after two weeks I noticed u barely get new stamps out of any of the packs  even the blue and pink stamps pack barely offer new stamps. I paid for so many coin packages that include stamps and got nothing but bogus 1-3 star stamps. The group on Facebook is useless as well people holding on to stamps like they actually worth something and they barely be wanting to help. 🙄 at this point start offering new stamps once in a while that’s why this hype didn’t last more than 30 days.

4,2023-05-24 13:31:22,So… pros.. the game is fun and you dont have to think too hard to play lol.  Cons…. The stickers you win include wayyy too many duplicates. You should at least get 2 new stickers to every sticker win.. and if you pay for them… you should get all new stickers.. Free rolls should also be 10 rather than 5-7… it takes at least 10 rolls to make any progress.,Pros and cons

4,2023-11-01 17:37:13,I just started back and I’ve gotten very far just today like I’ve upgraded 14 or 15 of my boards but now I try to upgrade the one I’m on but it keeps saying it requires game restart I’ve updated the game and everything but its still doing it but I don’t want to delete it so please fix this bug.,Keep saying require game restart

I get maybe twice but 7+ times in 30 minutes is ridiculous. Not only that, you have to wait an hour for 8 rolls, and it’s essentially a pay to win kind of game.

5,2023-10-22 00:36:53,This game is the BEST GAME EVER. Here is why you can play with friends anytime it’s just monopoly but on your phone it’s the most addictive game on my phone right now out off the 17 games. I have right now so you should definitely try this out if you love monopoly well your in for a treat.,Why you should play this game
3,2023-11-01 16:31:03,"It is humiliating enough to have a partner that refuses to help in events and even worse when the game is glitching out as I’m trying to finish the events.

2,2023-11-01 13:49:16,"This game is really great at giving you hope, and then taking it away. At first, you’ll get tons of cool unique stickers, and then you’ll go two weeks without ever seeing a new one. You’ll have a ton of fun in an event, and the next time it rolls around you’ll get a fraction of the tokens needed to participate, and the final goal will be increased by 20K points on top of it.  But don’t worry! You can buy 100 dice for $10 just so you can keep rolling.",Pay To Feel Better
3,2023-10-29 18:30:56,"This game is fun and highly addictive. I was really enjoying it until you get so far and then you get hardly anything unless you want to spend money to keep dice.  No gold cards in any of the safes you open, completely some albums is almost impossible. Partner events are even worse now that they have raised the amount you have to spend. Like you has 10,000 dice?","Fun, but…"
1,2023-10-23 05:03:29,"I like this game, but I’m not amused that it’s so hard to get stickers from the packs that either I buy or just get thru the board pieces even the ones that are guaranteed to get new stickers I’m not getting that allotment. The amount of time wasted on this game is torturous. It used to be fun to play on which I play with friends and family now I don’t even open it. Until the game gets upgraded or I get what we all have been paying for I won’t be playing anymore. :( it’s a shame because I really enjoyed it.",Not amused
5,2023-10-13 11:54:48,"I love this game & I spend more money than i’d like to admit on it lol but when you’re going around the board & land on the tokens that reward u, if u get more than 2 rewards at a time they don’t roll over to you & you get neither rewards. Seems to be the only problem right now.",rewarding
2,2023-10-15 21:07:18,"I don’t mind challenging games. But, this game is almost impossible to achieve goals without spending LOTS of money. I’m not sure why obtaining new stickers is pretty much impossible. For example, I was first place in a tournament and still got duplicates. The stickers was the deciding factor for me to give the game up. It’s not fun anymore and it’s too bad if they change the algorithm maybe more people will decide to keep playing instead of deleting the game",It was fun while it lasted
5,2023-10-10 09:31:46,Love game very addictive love playing with family an friends all n all great game .. Is there a way we can get more than 8 dice an hour? This makes it very hard to complete some of the goals having to wait an hour just play with only 8 dice is insane lol please boost it up to 75 or 100 that’s reasonable!!!!!,MoRE DICE !!!
1,2023-10-10 15:06:30,"When I first started playing it was so much fun, I actually would spend money for rolls and packs just so I could keep playing. Now with this recent album, it's harder to get the stickers you need especially the gold ones, it's hard to get rolls even with spending money. The system glitches often not getting the daily prizes etc and new stickers the golds. It was fun when I first started, now I only play when I get the 8 rolls an hour. Needles to say, I spent way too much money on this game.",It used to be fun
5,2023-09-30 16:41:54,"I ABSOLUTELY loveeeeee Monopoly Go!!!! Its so much fun to play. As im getting i to my groove to play today, the app started to lag and skip.

1,2023-10-07 16:16:50,Don’t mind all the bot posts flooding in trying to boost the rating. This game seems fun and harmless but after playing this game for about two months this game changed. You are at the mercy of the RNG gods and let me told you they are not favorable. I believe they need to add in the ability to see your actual odds of winning a card pack or pulling a card you need. The creator of this game is money hungry and not for the player base. Thank you for listening and I hope you make the right choice and uninstall the game.,Don’t waste you time
4,2023-10-05 16:22:39,"It would be nice to be able to send dice to friends only to help complete challenges but limit how meany times you can do that just like there is with trading card to 5 a day, also it would be nice to see the cards your friends need on your account so you can share them and help them out as well",Update please

If you ever just wanna play a board game you can just pull out your device and you have a board game. I play this game everyday and get rewards by how many days I play,The best game you’ll ever play

The game is fun but since the new album, the rewards have been minimal, which takes the joy out of completing sets when the reward is only 100 dice. That’s like 2 minutes of play time.

5,2023-08-09 18:50:27,I was minding my business at work until my friend sent me a request for this monopoly go game and I thought it was stupid but it ended up becoming addicting and now I always want more every second and it’s addicting. Completely took over my life.  But I’m the end it’s a fun game,Monopoly is the equivalent to meth
1,2023-09-01 21:42:45,"The amount of dice you get in an hour need to go way up, the cost to upgrade a board at level 150 is like 5 billion, then collecting pieces from the board is like collect 1500 pieces for 400 rolls and then to complete it!!! They just want you to spend money now, in the beginning it was fun but now not so much, the cards need to be easier to collect too so you can get duplicates and cash in for better packs because people don’t trade like they did in the beginning. And also make gold cards tradable!!!!!","Was fun, till they got money hungry"
1,2023-08-31 02:01:45,"Hi, so I been playing this game just like everyone else and it’s a very entertaining game. The thing I don’t like is that everyone has been searching for the same card. I know we are not supposed to sell them but instead of trading ALOT of people in the Facebook group decided to upload them and sell them on eBay. Y’all need to figure something out and do some so the last few cards will be easy to get for everyone. If y’all haven’t noticed that’s why a lot of people stop playing.",Fun getting taken away

I’m on 102 or 103 board and I’ve been getting 50 dice. 😓 we work hard for it (😅) and even pay for dice.  Plus can there also be an update to where we can either send people gold stars or not let us get double gold cards and in place of that let us pick what card we need for that one 😑,Needs an update
1,2023-08-14 12:46:24,"This is robbery. You contact customer support for a refund or AT LEAST game credit to justify all that money spent buying packages that “guarantee” you’ll get needed stickers, I was told that any purchases made through Apple have to be dealt with through Apple, and that they’re not responsible. Then you contact Apple and they say to get in touch with the game developer directly because they’re not responsible either. They should be sued for false advertising. I don’t know why they haven’t already.","Over $500 spent, ZERO new stickers. ISSUE A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,2023-08-13 11:55:39,The over all premise of the game is thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining.   HOWEVER the false lures of “invite” to play are completely bunk! There is not a single time I have used the invite feature and a subsequent invitee DID join from that specific invite link that I have ever been credited! Not only that experience has been proof. I myself joined from an invite link as I had no knowledge of the game until invited.   This is a serious flaw and should be addressed. Moreover those who’ve joined through links as well as those who sent invites be credited some sort of incentive regardless of how many people joined because the mere fact that none of the participants have been recognized as doing such.   Thanks for reading.,Flawed

However, the hash mark barely moves which makes it extremely hard to advance.",Stickers
1,2023-08-11 02:45:40,"The game was fun at first, as a daily player it is becoming less entertaining. Even spending money you will NOT complete the albums, so save your money!

The customer service needs work you never get to actually talk to anyone to help with errors with purchases. I would not recommend the game until these types of things are corrected.",Daily Player
1,2023-08-03 18:43:00,"The game is really fun however once you’re hooked you can’t get dice anymore. My biggest complaint is that the first time purchase bonuses are fantastic but if you don’t use them within a week of playing they get removed so instead of getting 18,000 dice for 100$ the first time you buy it you only get 3,200. That’s a major difference and it’s not worth it to spend 100 on 3k dice. I would have done it for the bonus of 1500 dice but they took that option away. So that’s why only 1 star.",Dice too hard to get
5,2023-07-28 17:06:58,I was placed number 5 in one of the tournament and soon as I got to 1 second and needed I did not receive my dice or my other prizes… what’s up with that? I refreshed the game and everything and nothing I paid money for this game so I do not appreciate you taking my money and keeping my prizes that’s such a rip off 😡,UNACCEPTABLE

The dice are not in your favor and even if you do break and spend real money they still are not lol but when the timer goes off you will hit the spots you needed all the time. There is no reason I should go around the board hitting all 4 corners on a times 50. The sticker packs are ehhh but it will take forever to get the ones you actually need and not duplicates, like over a month",Fun but a shameless cash grab

When you start the game, you’re greeted with literally SEVEN pop-ups about in-game events and shop offers.

5,2023-04-17 19:41:46,I absolutely love this game so far! The graphics and animations are so amazing! Glad I was invited to play this! I have two gripes. (1) it takes too long just to receive only 5 dice. It should be more dice and less time. (2) each friend you have should be able to give you dice (at least 2 dice).,Let’s GO
5,2023-10-20 19:42:00,I can’t get the reward for being in forth place I was supposed to get 400 rolls and never Received them not to mention I can’t get no more new stickers and I’m on level 98 and don’t get rewards from friends chest they open.

1,2023-10-26 18:45:47,So I began using the group to trade stickers since it seems to be next to impossible to complete these sticker sets. Who are the admins? If the whole point of the group is to trade why am I getting banned? 2 days in a row I’m banned for 24 hours for posting what I have to trade with other players. Meanwhile there’s constantly ppl posting scams for dice. I also spent over $50 this week trying to see if that would help. I only received 2 stickers that I needed. I love this game but it’s just disappointing that you have to spend money and still not really get any reward for it. I also don’t understand why you all promote the Facebook page just for the admins to ban a player when they post. Please do better this game is really a lot of fun I just wish it was easier to achieve the rewards,Facebook trading group

I have spent more money during the month of September than I have on other things, don’t add this game because I still get hundreds of card duplicates!!!!  There’s so much that can be said but avoid adding this game at all, it ain’t worth it!!!!",Don’t add this game!
1,2023-09-28 07:20:03,The game used to be a lot of fun and addictive but the new season has been terrible. It’s a lot harder to get gold cards therefore it’s a lot harder to get more dice. The tournaments are IMPOSSIBLE to even get close to winning because it’s loaded with bots. The game changed alot because the developers are greedy. There’s a strike going on that has people on the fb groups/ discord groups for this game refusing to play from Wednesday-Friday in hopes developers will hear out our issues and make changes. But who knows if it’ll make a difference.,Rigged
1,2023-09-27 18:00:09,"Was fun in the beginning, but as you progress it gets harder and harder to get enough dice to play so that you can earn rewards.  Too many duplicate stickers are given and everyone is looking for the same sticker to trade. Be aware, if you are willing to pay mega real bucks….I’m talking about 100’s of dollars not 2, 3, or 5….you “might” get ahead, but paying is not even a guarantee. I get that they want to make money, but this is pure greed for what could be a fun game. Like the title said….I’m over this game! Plain boring!",Over this game
1,2023-09-20 15:49:45,I enjoyed the game the first week or two until it gets to the point where ya play 8 rolls at a time because theyre so stingy with dice. Once ya get the easy stickers it slows down to the point where it’s completely boring! I’m just fed up with it. Ya get so close to winning dice but with 8 rolls a hour ya never make it. Seems to me like only way to get somewhere is to spend money which I don’t mind occasionally but not constantly! If things don’t change it will be deleted very soon. And it’s sad because it could be an awesome game!,Unhappy
5,2023-09-12 17:04:46,"I love this game. Its is so awesome. I play it everyday. After i wake up, i play monopoly go. When im eating, i play monopoly go. In the bathroom? Monopoly go. I sometimes dont go to sleep because i am playing monipoly go. Please install this game! My landlord kicked me out of the house because I said “F***K YOU” after i didnt pay rent bcoz i was litorally playing mono polgy go.",Monopoly go
1,2023-09-18 22:50:35,The game is so rigged. It won’t let you land on anything you need. The wheel boost only gives you the orange pack with 1-2* dupes. We have to play with 8 dice an hour and yet the events are designed for people with thousands of dice or buying dice. The offers in the shop aren’t worth buying because the dice are gone in seconds. It costs me billions to clear a board just to get 50 dice that don’t bring in enough money to build. The bots bankrupt you constantly and MoGo won’t do anything about it. I’m so over it 😡.,Don’t waste your time!
1,2023-09-17 06:14:26,"This game is very rigged and is nothing but a pay to win game. The events can give decent rewards, but the only time I consistently land on the right spots is right after the event ends, and it doesn’t matter. I loved the game when I first started, but shortly after starting, it became very obvious that the game is pay to win. I hardly ever get new stickers and the rewards are getting worse and worse as I play. I definitely do not recommend unless you want a game to waste a bunch of money on just to be successful in the game.",Rigged

5,2023-09-12 13:31:55,"I love the game! I think you would be able to trade gold cards! I also feel like they give you the same cards way to often , kinda makes it nearly next to impossible to reach goals, & the invite bar doesn’t even work for me!","It’s a great game but,"
5,2023-09-10 14:40:53,I love the game but hate getting duplicates of stickers I don’t need and would be nice to trade gold stickers to others. It would help people completing the sticker sets if we could gift the gold stickers and limit the amount of duplicates. I don’t need 6 of one sticker.,Fun just wish we could trade gold stickers
1,2023-09-11 20:14:52,This game can be really fun and addicting however it’s definitely setup more to be a money grab. This game should allow you more dice within the hour. Also on the mini challenges like the baking one that just ended if the partners are someone who isn’t participating than you should have the option to get a new partner. An the stickers that can’t be traded are near impossible to get unless you wanna spend a bunch of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky.,Needs a lot of work!!!
5,2023-08-27 02:27:49,This game is so flipping great you will not regret getting this. All my friends say it sounds like I’m getting payed to say this but I kid you not this game is so fun to play with family and it’s fun to just feel accomplished. This game is great for when you are bored or even when you aren’t there are no ads at all !! GET IT !,GET THIS!!
4,2023-09-06 03:10:59,Give us more and better dice/card options on spins !!!!! 240 million is cool for low ranks but for higher ranks I would rather drink my own pee than to finally earn a spin and get crapped on with that low amount of cash.  Also I should get at least 10k dice for taking the time to write this review to make your app a better version of itself.,!!!!!!!
3,2023-09-06 02:49:04,"This game isn’t bad at all. It can be addictive when you start winning a lot of cash. The negative for me is the dice. You only get 5 dice every hour. You will soon see that 5 dice will get you no where. So then you wait around for more dice because I refuse to pay for extra dice. I think you should be able to use your winnings, ask friends or watch ads to get extra dice.",Not a bad game
1,2023-09-05 15:49:29,"THIS GAME STARTED OFF WITH NOTHING BUT FUN AND SOMETHING TO PASS TIME! NOW ITS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR GAMES OUT RIGHT NOW. THE GAME IS DESIGNED TO MAKE MONEY AND SCAM YOU OUT OF YOUR MONEY. THEY ARE THE MOST SELFISH APP DESIGNERS IVE EVER SEEN. THE PPL WERE TELLING THEM HOW THEY SHOULD CHANGE THIS AND CHANGE THAT FOR THE BETTER OF THE PLAYERS. INSTEAD OF TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION, THEY DID THE TOTAL OPPOSITE! Most games you can send friends coins or help out. You can’t even buy dice with the money you win off the game. Instead you have to spend cash. It was all fun and games until the creators became more greedy and way more selfish! This is one of the most ridiculous and rip off games I’ve EVER come across‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️",RIP OFF
3,2023-09-03 13:33:20,This game would be way better if yall would actually make it to where we can send and recieve gifts daily from our friends and also have free daily spins and stuff. Also where we can watch video ads to get more free stuff if yall dont do better updates/upgrades yall are gonna lose alot of players its already made to be doing the samething over and over again. How boring.,Dice
1,2023-08-31 13:42:21,listen.. the game is VERY addicting but it’s not fair that they have this album event going on and i keep getting extras for ones i already have and not getting any new ones. there’s 5 hours left and i STILLLL have 7 more albums to complete. that’s not fair. why make it this short and then stop giving out extras a few days before it ends ????? i love the game it’s just they aren’t being fair with the albums in my opinion. it’s easy to rank up but hard to win challenges such as the albums . -_-,ummm i said 5 at first BUT ..
1,2023-08-30 17:43:39,I have a few gold stars still left to get and I’ve given up on them. I’ve gotten multiple blue card packs and I get the same gold cards in the pack. I’ve even gotten 2 of the same gold cards in the same pack. And I had a person send me 3 of the same cards and I have yet to receive it and it’s been 2 days and it’s still not there. Can’t trust anyone on the group. There should be an option to trade gold cards too. I’ve almost given up on this game. It’s no fun anymore,It’s alright but problems
5,2023-08-27 00:06:32,The game is great our whole family is in love including our 1 year old granddaughter.. BUT getting any new stickers is nearly impossible. Even when you exchange/buy stickers you don’t get any new stickers. There’s some changes that can definitely be made to the game.,Awesome game BUT…
5,2023-08-24 14:50:38,"Monopoly go is sooooo much fun! I downloaded it a couple days ago and I’m like obsessed! You get showered with money and rewards; you can attack people’s landmarks and earn a TON of money! Plus, when you’re rolling on the board, there’s an auto roll so you don’t have to keep pressing to roll! 6/5 stars for me! SO FUN",Monopoly go!
3,2023-08-26 19:28:24,The games doesn’t always move the correct number of spaces so you miss out on rewards. It also gives you the same stickers over and over but won’t give you the ones you actually need. Why give someone multiple of the same gold stickers that can’t even be traded. I will be deleting this game if the issues are not fixed.,Need to fix the game
5,2023-08-14 07:37:06,"I am always a night person even after work and after everyone falls asleep I’ve gotten cleaning done and nothing else needs to be done I’m always bored but this game is really fun, it keeps me entertained and it’s fun to play during daughters nap time",Can’t sit still and need to be occupied
4,2023-08-19 20:49:36,Love Monopoly Go. Had an issue with making a trade. A sticker was sent but never received. Tried to contact CS but the in-game CS feature only takes you back to the link that sends you to the same info. It’s a complete circle and ridiculous. I would appreciate Customer Service reaching out to help me.,Why can’t we contact customer support?
3,2023-08-14 20:51:10,"Overall, I’ve found the game really fun to play, but there is an issue that I have been having for a while now. My name keeps changing in the game, and every time I change my name back to what I want it to be, it changes again and it’s so annoying to deal with. Please fix this bug so that my friends don’t accidentally shut my properties down not knowing it is me.",Name Change Issue
5,2023-08-14 02:30:58,Monopoly Go is a really fun game when your bored and don’t know what to do. You get to destroy other peoples money and get cash from it and you use your money to upgrade the buildings you get from every city. This is a great game if you want to relax and play a game. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do!,Monopoly go review

5,2023-07-18 13:19:00,At this point it's soo inserting and I can't stop playing unless I have no more rolls left but other than that i love the Aratester and the things about it the people cheering for u in the middle of the board and how u get to change from I city to another wow monopoly go u really out done your self's👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,It's a good idea of a game
3,2023-08-13 05:47:54,There is much to be desired playing this game. Also much that can be done better. Dice Dice and more Dice. 8 dice per hour is ludicrous. Every time you move up in the map you should get increase in dice. It’s just the same 50. Not cool. You shouldn’t be looking for the same cards for weeks. There should be a dice grab like the money grab also. Outside of all that. It’s a fun game. Play at your own risk!,Enjoyable and Disappointing
2,2023-08-10 21:11:37,I am not sure why I have not received my purchase but $100 isn’t a lot to loose but isn’t a little to loose! Trying to get ahold of customer service is a whole headache in itself. I don’t recommend purchasing anything at this time! Game glitches are more and more the higher the level you are. Just FYI for those who wanna spend money on games. If this ever gets corrected I will still be iffy to purchase in the future from here on out.😡😡😡,Purchase
1,2023-08-04 22:13:22,"I thought the point of having friends to play games with was to make them more enjoyable. This game literally creates a list of all the people you add as friends and let’s you destroy everything they work for, steal their in game money, and basically create a situation where every time you log back in to continue playing you are starting over. And for that I cannot recommend this game to anyone. There are better things to do with your time and possibly money.",Maybe I’m missing the point…
4,2023-08-02 04:28:54,"Good and addictive game but just like others have said previously, I’ve invited multiple friends who’ve joined through my link and yet haven’t received anything for it. I also think it would be a really good idea in a update to be able to search up friends so we can trade and target them!",The only game I have downloaded
2,2023-07-30 03:04:47,Don’t ever spend any money on this app! You will never get the cards or anything you need to continue! The app will delay you from finishing regardless of increasing in levels and status if you spend money on it. I know other people who haven’t spent one dollar but are getting what they need in the game to continue. The game withholds cards and dice in order to get me to spend more money. Deleting soon because it’s fixed to get you to spend money.,Money
3,2023-07-27 11:48:54,"The game is fun to play but when you buy stickers they only give duplicates, not the stickers you actually need. And when the events like the free parking are happening I never land on the corners. As soon as it’s over I land on corners all day. And when I finish a board I feel like the rewards should be bigger. Spending 100million+ to get maybe 2million back is kind of crazy. And only 50 rolls. What’s up with that.",Kind of scam
3,2023-07-23 13:55:52,I love playing the game and had a lot of friends and family join as well but it gets to point where we all really want to quit. You keep give the same cards so no can complete the albums I have gotten so much of the same cards and wasted stars on the vault to only get one new card. The the game needs to do better are people will get tired of playing and quit.,Fun but stressful
1,2023-07-20 21:57:45,"See, I was happy with this game. Now I’m just upset 😠 Lately I’ve been sending lots of invites to get more dice. My invite bar has stayed at 3/10 & I know I’ve invited more than that. I was fighting with my husband for a full week to get monopoly, he didn’t want to download it. Until He felt bad, as did my daughter & they both used my link to get monopoly, I didn’t receive any dice for them two joining, I made a big deal for nothing 🙄 They make it so difficult to acquire dices, you really have to hustle for it or purchase it.",Rewards
5,2023-07-14 00:06:30,Great game. But why isn’t there a chat in the game for friends? So they can ask each other to trade cards? Also think the “gold” cards should be tradable but maybe one a day or week. Having an in game chat would probably cut down on people getting scammed on the Facebook pages.,Chats.
5,2023-07-12 01:12:33,I love this game me and my family would play this game when we were kids it’s always a good game to play with family the smiles the laughs and making it to the richest was a blast I give this game 5 stars it takes me back to my childhood times and plus u will be hooked on this games🫶🏼😊,Really amazing game
5,2023-07-06 02:26:55,I love this game so much. I get to play with all of my Facebook friends. Besides some bugs that need to be fixed like when they drop new things everyone wants to get on the game it kicks me out and some other people because of how many people are on. Other then that best game I have,Best game ever

5,2023-04-19 12:05:03,This game is very entertaining and if you don’t know how to play monopoly u still can just do whatever u feel like doing you build and upgrade buildings with ur money u earn by leveling up. This game is definitely for long car rides And more. So my experience with this game so far is a five star rate,Monopoly Go
1,2023-07-01 09:43:32,"The editor notes say that this is a twist on the real game. It it more like clash of clans than monopoly. You have to purchase stuff like the Statue of Liberty, but it has a monopoly board… that’s good right? No! You have to pay real money or do some hard challenges to be able to roll the DICE. And, on top of this ruined by greed game, you also can land on a railroad to ROB A BANK? If you do not think any of this is true, download and delete after to see.

3,2023-06-10 02:34:52,This game is really good I had fun and there was always things to do.  I enjoyed this game but it’s really competitive and a lot of times I don’t get dice rolls for a long time since I have to wait an hour for 5 rolls. There is also an unnecessary amount of gift and rewards takes me forever to even get to the part where I can roll the dice and get a chance to play.  Still a good game but needs changes.,Good but got boring
5,2023-10-28 13:42:50,I really do love MonopolyGO where everyone can battle anyone and destroy and become friends everyone is having a blast at this game.

Just a money grab, literally no way to complete or play.

3,2023-11-03 10:56:04,The game is fun but could be better if they didn’t make it so hard to advance. They want you to spend your money! Shouldn’t be so hard to get stickers you need! Should be so hard to get what you need to finish the mini games! It’s all about money! Games is getting boring and soon people will move on if they don’t make it more enjoyable!,Could be better
4,2023-11-01 20:16:32,I’ve messaged many times about there should be a better way to trade cards. Both stickers have to up in boxes to do a trade…but gifting should still be a option.   Why do dice and sticker packs have to be $100?!?!   Honestly this last Halloween car event was far to hard!!! Low balling our rolls so we’d have to buy more dice!?? Where’s the fun gone in this game?   Not to mention that each pack in the album had a gold card to get with less dice then the none gold albums with more dice the last sticker album.

4,2023-10-31 11:09:19,This game is a lot of fun. And there are some bonus incentives to keep playing. However the rate at which rolls regenerate is not the greatest.

Even when you purchase their offers they will give you duplicate stickers, you will quickly roll through dice without getting the rewards and the most recent spooky car partners they upped the required points to complete and lowered the rewards gained.

5,2023-10-06 23:01:37,I so love this game. It keeps me wanting more. I just wish the creators would consider the players passing along tokens they can not use when they have finished the challenges. I would love to gift some of the tokens to my friends so they can have a chance to win,Love the game
4,2023-10-13 00:41:50,"The game is interesting, but with the rewards from playing, personally I feel you should be able to trade in your doubles for new cards without having to be linked to s asbestos other source. Bigger rewards should also be given out to those who don’t make purchases to level up.",Monopoly Go

For example, Easter, valentines, states, jungle, desert, Dubai, new boards please.  It’s a game so it’s not supposed to be easy, but it shouldn’t be rigged either.  A lot time the amount of dice you spend or objects you must collect, does not match the value of the prize.",Fun but expensive
5,2023-10-06 02:18:12,"I love the game I just think when it comes to do the gold cards we should at least be able to send 1 gold card a day to a friend, because why do we get extra gold ones if we cant do nothing with them",Just one add on i think u should do

It takes 10 hours to get 80 dice. On the higher level, it’s an unfair advantage. Those players will have to purchase dice in order to keep winning on the game. This is ridiculous. This game used to be fun and now it’s it’s a pay to play monopoly should really be a shame of themselves.",They should change the name to money go!
5,2023-09-21 22:41:40,So this game is actually really fun!! But the only thing is that you get money every second of the game. Then if children play this they will think that “oh!

3,2023-09-27 16:58:22,This game is addicting but you can get anywhere in the tournaments and events without using actual money to get dice.

1,2023-09-09 13:30:23,I have reached out to customer service after purchasing a bundle and didn’t get the stickers as advertised. They came back with there would be something on my game when I had returned to play and  nothing. It’s ridiculous that I paid for something and still have yet to receive. The dice is a issue and 50 dice to complete each level is stupid. Make each level more and more because it costs more each level. Don’t ruin this game by being greedy,Fix your issues
3,2023-09-08 11:19:11,"Game is super fun. At first they get you with a bunch of opportunities to get dice… as you move through the challenges it obviously gets harder, but they make it nearly impossible after a while. Not enough dice to move about the board, not enough different rewards for mini games and challenges… 4 cakes in 4 days? Not likely. Just another game I’ll inevitably stop playing bc it’s impossible.",Fun but not
2,2023-09-06 23:10:45,"I’ve reached out to the developer over the last few weeks about missing items and disappearing in app “money”. No one responds. The game is super buggy and things don’t register , such as the cookies for this new event. Also, getting a guaranteed missing card doesn’t actually mean that- you can apparently get a duplicate and they will ignore you. And also you can get double charged for purchases as well.",Be careful with in app purchases
1,2023-09-04 23:06:53,"This game used to be fun and rewarding. Then it got popular and the devs got greedy. Now they’ve reduced the rewards by 75%, especially for dice rolls. They want people to spend more money by not giving the cards you need, increasing non-tradable cards, and making cards harder to get in general. Even just playing the game normally, you’re constantly prompted for purchases and “deals”. The deals aren’t even deals anymore because they’ve reduced the amount you get for the same price.","Used to be fun. Now it’s rigged, unfair, and money driven"
2,2023-08-31 18:19:14,To progress in the game it is a pay to play game. It uses slot machine addiction mechanics and it rewards system does not scale with your level. It’s 3 billion for me to complete 1 board and one reward is 5 dice! I am level 150 still get 50 rolls ad a reward for completing a board! Plus they inundate you with ads to buy packs/dies and non coincidentally your so so close to a reward in a daily contests that it’s enticing. These 1.99 purchases and can quickly become 100’s of dollars,Pay to play!
5,2023-08-24 23:04:32,"I like being able to play a game casually, and this seems like the type of game in the background. I’ve only just started, but from what I’ve seen you can buy rolls, do not, I don’t think it’s worth it for such a game. But I do recommend it as a free to play game.",This game is good for casual play
1,2023-08-27 15:06:12,"Don’t waste your time. Do not download. In the beginning it was fun, but it is impossible to complete. I have not gotten a single new card for 3 weeks now and even when I have paid for extra rewards, I just get duplicates. 7 dices an hour is ridiculous and the rewards is mediocre. If you think you can play without paying, you are wrong. It used to be a fun game to play with family and friends, but everyone I know has already deleted the game.",You can’t advance without spending.
1,2023-08-26 14:37:08,"It’s one thing to have bots fill up all the slots on the tournaments so that you actual users will spend their hard earned money to keep up. It’s another thing to randomly have a bot aka A FAKE PERSON CREATED BY MONOPOLY steal 2 BILLION from me in a heist. It doesn’t help that their customer service is non existent, there is nowhere to be found where you can talk to an agent or even send an email.   Who wants to play against stacked odds? They want to inconvenience their players to encourage micro transactions at every opportunity.",Manipulation by developers
5,2023-08-20 16:12:16,"Love the game although initially downloaded it when saw it as my best friend loves Monopoly and we never have time to sit and play the actual board game! After downloading it I found both my adult kids played, and have spent more time playing it than all of them! It is addicting!",Great time
4,2023-08-23 13:10:54,"I love playing Monopoly Go, such a great way to pass time. I do not pay money(as others say it’s a pay to play) and i still feel like i’m moving forward and getting rewards, only flaw would be getting so many duplicate cards. I just wish there was a better way to get cards that are new to the player.",a good game
5,2023-08-12 22:21:30,"They need to make this game to where when you trade stickers, before the trade goes through, both people need to accept the trade. If not, then the trade is voided. This will keep scammers at bay. Also - it would be nice to have a “ Dice grab” as a chance card 😁other than that - it’s a great game !! Fun and very active. PLAY ON !!!",Trading stickers
1,2023-08-18 19:36:09,"This game was fun to play at first, but it’s not anymore. I thought it was meant to play with friends and the only people that could bank heist you is your own friends. I’ve come to realize, people who I don’t even know just keep bank heisting me of ALL my money. Ex: 252 mil, 153 mil, 91 mil, etc. It’s becoming real annoying at this point and just discourages me from wanting to play. If that’s monopoly’s way of trying to keep you to play, that’s a pretty crappy way to go about it since that’s not suppose to happen.",Bankrupted by strangers
5,2023-08-12 03:32:49,"love this game , me and my friends talk about it ALL day BUT waiting a whole HOUR for just 5 rolls is a bit too long for me .. just saying .. also , gold cards should be able to traded especially because the game gives multiples of them",the time for rolls is crazy and the good cards ugh
5,2023-08-11 14:38:49,MonopolyGO keeps your mind off things when you’re mad and it’s absolutely very fun you can play with your friends everyone and you get a lot of money and you can collect more and more money so you can unlock more cities,Very fun game and keeps your mind off some things
5,2023-07-25 00:46:49,"I love this game it’s very good and helps me practice, but there could be a few changes like maybe bringing up is a bank heist every time you do it, but other than that, I really don’t know what else to say about this game. It’s really good and I think if you wanna practice monopoly in the real game, this would be really good.",AMAZING GAME
3,2023-08-03 00:43:01,"I went in to this game thinking that it was just a reskin but when I got in I the tutorial showed me that it’s not and you use the monopoly board to get money and you use that money to buy landmarks. Not only that but you can also shut down and rob people. Don’t get me wrong it’s a good game, but it’s not what I wanted.I think this game is for monopoly fans that want something new, but keep that original monopoly feel.",Wow
3,2023-07-31 16:56:54,"I love this game, it’s addicting. But, my major issue with it is that rolls take forever to replenish and it’s not always easy to win them in game. As you move up the levels, it only truly makes sense to play with your roll multiplier as high as it can go, which means you burn through rolls so fast. It makes me want to play the game less because when I am in the mood to play, I never have rolls.","Super fun, but…"
5,2023-07-23 01:10:32,This game is really addicting but it did glitch and didn’t give me 10 million coins when I hit on one of the things they have going on. I hit enough spots to collect the amount I need to get the 10 million in coins but didn’t receive it but other then that the game is great!,Fun addicting game

5,2023-07-16 17:55:27,"It’s definitely addictive, but the monopoly community is so helpful. Especially the Facebook group. We’re really rooting for each other. There should be a MonopolyGO live version where we can play for real money 12 players at a time with a chat feature, that would be super lit !",Love the game !
2,2023-07-17 21:38:42,"This game helped me realize that I need to start doing better things with my life; I’m literally sitting here pushing a button with no real gain — it’s akin to that of a casino in the addictive nature, but no true reward. It’s also incredibly loaded with ads so they’re shoving freemium morality down your throat. I give it two stars because hey, it’s for the same people who scroll through social media with no drive or intention and are easily sucked into the numbing nature of mindless, amorphic humanity.",Sad
5,2023-07-14 18:54:54,"I’m telling you this game is a blast from the past and it’s fantastic fun to play and once you start playing you can’t stop it’s so addictive and trust me I don’t play games on the phone anytime, but this one has been a blast to play and you’re going love it just like I do believe that…..",Big Boss Man
5,2023-07-13 05:11:51,I don’t like playing the board game so I wasn’t sure what I was getting into but once I started I can not stop it is a great game fun for kids and easy for them as well my whole family is  Competing for the top spot.

1,2023-07-08 08:50:31,This games is so stupid it has no goal all boards are repeated. What’s the objective to the game??? You auto roll you can’t pick properties and you don’t know what you own then when you see houses or hotels on the board then what’s called color set complete pops up and all the houses and hotels disappear and you start all over. I mean you can just put it on auto roll and go to sleep the game will play by it’s self.. this is super dumb there are not game rules or instructions.. if I could give zero stars I would.,Stupid game
5,2023-11-08 17:38:41,"This game is very addictive. However, you should be able to get more than 80 dice. Because when you were at your max dice, you really can’t do any of the big moves unless you’re paying for dice. They should up this to at least 120 or 200.",Dice

Every time I open the game, it automatically goes into a shutdown and I can’t click anything. I’ve even tried on different devices and still no luck. Reached out to customer support but all they have is bots that asks for your in-game user ID. I can’t get to the user ID because the game automatically loads into the shutdown. Would have given it 4 stars if I could actually play again.","Was great, until it wasn’t"
4,2023-07-05 23:00:09,This is my new favorite game. At first I was frustrated about waiting an hour for 5 dice but I see the more you progress there are ways to win more dice but now this technical error has me about to pull my hair out because my shields are being knocked down and I can’t defend myself cause I can’t get into the game!!,Fix the glitch please. I love this game
3,2023-07-03 02:55:05,It’s a pretty solid game especially if you can get your friends to play. However it lacks content and is riddled with a bunch of in app ads to get you to buy in app purchases. I understand they have to make money somehow but it’s a constant barrage of ads. The lack of content could also really kill the game. They do have a cool gatcha system with stickers and you can trade with friends which is pretty neat,Mindless fun
4,2023-06-29 00:55:23,My and my family like this game a lot. It very fun when you have people to play with. The only problem I have is with name. I log into the wrong Facebook account and now I can’t change my name at all. If y’all fix to where you can change your name multiple times this will help a lot. Otherwise this is a very fun game.,Name changes
3,2023-06-23 16:09:21,"This game is loads of mobile fun, but they need to chill out with the microtransactions. Every moment you play this game you’re getting spammed with pop-ups to purchase something useless and expensive. The screen animations are also infuriating, I wish I could simply open chests without receiving a 15 second screen animation to show me the $20 I made in return.",Great fun yet still needs a lot of work
1,2023-06-15 13:26:52,"I get that shut downs are a part of the game. But the same person shutting me down literally 25 times in 40 minutes takes all the fun out of it. There’s nothing to be done, no recourse but to delete the person from my friends list and pray they don’t find me again. There needs to be block buttons for players who want to abuse your system to target an individual person an obscene amount of times. This is now the second time I uninstall a game I love over this same person.",Targeting system ruins the fun
4,2023-06-14 13:41:05,"The longer I play this game the more I understand but nothing is random about the dice rolls.

2,2023-06-05 12:35:25,"I wish I could give the game 0 stars but I can’t. The glitches are a huge problem. You don’t get dice like your supposed to when adding friends. The heist feature doesn’t multiply correctly and the only way to try and win anything is by spending money. I said try because you still don’t get what you need after spending money, its “Random”. No its a rip off.  Contacting support is a waist of time because they will not respond to you.",Waist of time.
2,2023-05-29 03:46:30,"this is a fun game - we’re enjoying playing it - but only getting 5 dice per hour is a big drag. those 5 dice are gone in seconds, and the purchase price for more dice is so hilariously astronomical that I’d never consider paying it. most games with in-app purchases will give you a good amount of play for a few bucks, but paying $2 for 30 dice that will be gone in a minute? nope. hopefully they will add other ways to earn dice.",slow dice accrual makes it a bummer.
5,2023-11-06 19:18:21,Love playing this game! Collecting the stickers to complete the book is a challenge if you aren’t in the facebook group. I just wish I could chat with the people on my board. I also think it would be fun to chat with my partners during events.,Love the game buttttttt
5,2023-11-01 16:04:31,I love playing monopoly go but some days the app doesn’t let you upgrade your buildings and says error. I updated the game thinking that was the problem but it’s still happening. I wish there was a way to report issues in the game,Usually really good
2,2023-11-06 13:23:19,If you guys don’t fix the glitch of people that’s not your friends being able to attack you 10 times in a row but we can only get revenge once and we can’t block them because they aren’t on our friends list! So how do they get to find out property so much if they’re not on our friends list! Fix it! Make us be able to remove any one! This is gonna make a lot of people erase!! Fix immediately!,Glitch!
1,2023-11-03 21:09:11,Cash cow for sure. You will get ripped off . Every complaint gets ignored or you become a target for a phantom player which really or the bots for the developers they steal all your bank and shutdown all your landmarks because they know exactly when to do it. They are the only one consistently targets you annoyingly out of the friends on your leaderboard and random players. It’s insulting that the developers think they can’t be figured out. I’m deleting App and you guys if you get to. Read this review BEWARE!!!,Beware  DO NOT DOWNLOAD**
4,2023-11-03 02:11:50,It’s a really fun game however there are often times you don’t receive items when unlocking them. I also think it’s impossible to get every sticker unless you make major in app purchases. In app purchases are incredibly expensive for barely and rolls.,Addicting but buggy
3,2023-11-02 11:27:04,So many adds that pop up that beg you to buy rolls. It’s annoying. Then you never really earn a decent amount of rolls. You never really get the stickers because they tend to send you the same ones over and over again. I see so many people that have stop playing because it’s repetitive of the same things no decent rolls and same stickers.,It’s ok

2,2023-11-01 16:25:00,"The game restarts several times while you’re playing causing you to lose your progress, money and miss out when they have tournaments also we will never be able to complete boards with the same cards given over and over sad to say I have spent $ but not anymore and lastly the dice rolled don’t add up to where you land this game is definitely fixed but now your going to lose good ppl who liked to play",Epic failure
5,2023-11-01 10:01:34,Just a few suggestions. For a update it would be nice to send a message to your Monopoly friends especially during the partner events. Cost of dice purchase is high.

2,2023-10-30 18:51:25,This game started out so much fun! Now it’s always a struggle to get what you need to play.

I know I sound like I’m repeating myself, but it’s the ugly truth, especially when you get so far along in the game where 1000+ dice means nothing respective to your board and how much upgrading landmarks cost. You could write a book about how twisted this game is when it comes to microtransactions.",Epitome of Microtransactions
5,2023-10-17 00:05:36,I enjoy the game but it turns into a realm one thing really quick. With only five free rolls every hour and only paid for opportunities it gets frustrating when you just want to burn time and play the game.

4,2023-10-08 04:06:59,The game is great for the most part. The only aggravating aspect is the lack of ability to block someone in game. Lately I’ve had a certain person who is not on my friends list attacking my properties non stop and I don’t even know who they are…so maybe add that option and the game will be more enjoyable,Lack of preventive safety measure

1,2023-09-27 13:20:53,The game is definitely pay to play. It’s near impossible to complete anything unless you buy dice once you get in to the higher levels and tournaments! Dice rolls also seem to be preselected and not random. It was definitely preselected early on before they updated it. You could roll with phone in airplane mode then restart the games connected to data and it would roll the exact same numbers that were rolled in airplane mode. This was fixed because it became a way to cheat.,It’s PAY TO PLAY!!!!
3,2023-09-26 22:57:07,I would give it a 4 star but the fact that I have to be reminded that I can buy dice when I run out is getting very old and annoying. When I open a game I shouldn’t have 10 pop ups before I can even enjoy the game and when I run out I have 1-4 pop ups.

3,2023-09-20 00:16:26,8 dice an hour is Bull … number 1 complaint by all players is the 8 dice an hour . Too little amount of dice for that long of a wait . You trying to pressure people into purchasing dice but really they may just lose interest and uninstall the game.  Listen to your players . Other complaints those dang cards highly annoying how many repeat cards you get and barely any gold ones .,Dice !
2,2023-09-19 13:34:29,"I enjoy the game but lately haven’t been receiving rewards from the game. It’s frustrating. I’ve reached out to Scopley regarding the issues and they tell me they can’t help me basically. They want screenshots of everything. If I’m playing my game why would I think I’m supposed to screenshot rewards? It’s no good to screenshot what’s missing because HELLO, it’s MISSING! I’ve put money into the game and friends but this game isn’t giving like it’s supposed to.",Not receiving rewards
1,2023-09-18 15:48:51,I’ve been playing this game for about three months now.  It’s the biggest dog water game in the world.  Pay to win. They make it impossible to get new gold cards.  The game is rigged so you will not win. It’s almost like when you play the game. The game doesn’t even want you to play it. I have yet to get a community chest in the three months playing. When  all my other friends have got it multiple times.   I feel like you should stop cheating your players.  Zero stars.,This game is a joke
1,2023-09-14 12:43:05,"I really enjoy this game, but the same pop-ups come up multiple times as you play. Like the invite friends pop-up. It gets really annoying after a while. Also, I feel like I was robbed, I was playing one of the challenges and I was like 10 bones away from winning 750 rolls and the next time I logged in, the opportunity was gone but the challenge was still on.   I think if the game limited the pop-ups to one time it would greatly increase enjoyment.",Too many pop-ups
1,2023-09-12 02:01:51,"I used to love this game until the recent update. The new album is terrible and the rewards for completing the sets is ridiculous. We get less dice this album, barely new stickers when we open a new pack, all sets have golds and it’s harder to get the 1 star golds as much as the 5 star golds. Also we don’t get the wheel everyday, the chest doesn’t give the prize and the tournaments rewards are getting ridiculous. We gotta use too much dice to complete a tournament and we barely get dice unless we buy dice. DO BETTER MONOPOLY!!! 😒",THE GAME BECAME GREEDY!!!
1,2023-09-11 20:02:40,"Customer service is TERRIBLE! I messaged customer service 4 days ago and Still have not received a response. The game has been glitching lately and stealing in game wins, not giving you everything you purchased, and freezing up during bank heists forcing you to restart the game & forfeit your wins. But apparently don’t waste your time trying to contact customer service because it will be a while if they ever respond or try to make it right at all.",The game screws you & Customer Service Never responds
2,2023-09-07 23:24:53,"I’m at board 145 and it’s just not worth playing anymore. 8 dice an hour? When my boards are costing a billion dollars+ to complete? And then only 50 dice for completing it? This is insane.. I’m usually not one to complain about mobile games, but this one started off fun and addicting, now it’s a waste of time and a money grab to play. Really disappointing.. not to mention the .006% chance to get the sticker you need. Come on, do better…",Pay to win - lack of incentive
1,2023-09-03 05:03:00,"At first I loved this game, I was addicted for weeks, and while it was annoying at points when I didn’t have enough spins to complete challenges, I still overall loved the game. However, the recent changes to the game have been HORRIBLE. Winning 300 spins to complete a deck only getting, winning 25 spins when you open a vault, Needing a gold card in every single deck!!!! I’m sad to say I will be deleting this game because at first I really did love it but it has become a ridiculous disappointment.",Big disappointment
1,2023-09-02 21:03:38,since 2 days before the last sticker event ended after spending months collecting stickers I was 4 stickers away and didn’t get a fair chance to finish and the kicker is I’m still stuck on the same bank heist as I write this review can even ask for help In the app because it’s frozen I literally invested over $150 bucks for nothing and didn’t get a fair chance to win the wildlife event after coming so close just 4 stickers away with 2days left,My game has been stuck on the same bank heist

1,2023-09-02 16:47:09,"I spent a fair amount of money on the last album. I completed it. All I know is I’m not spending anything on this album. Even if I get the cards, it’s not worth it. Highest album last season paid over 6k spins. This album? 1.8k spins? Yeah hard pass. Most of them I would blow through in 5 min. They took a great game and made it crap. I’m a high level now because of the money I spend. Now the payouts are so low I can hardly progress. Y’all are literally punishing the people paying you. 😂 What a joke.",New album

There’s no control, no game, no skill involved, you just push that button and watch it do what ever it’s going to do.  Lazy cash grab, filled with ads, I will say, my 5 yo loves to hit the button and watch all the fun things happen.  If you’re not 5 though, it will prove less than stimulating.  With a name like “monopoly” I’d expect much better.",Repetitive Button Pusher
2,2023-08-27 09:41:56,"I got scammed many times by the game- paying for stuff and not receiving items, charges I didn’t click on. Their algorithm is crappy. The fun thing about actual monopoly is that it’s all up to chance however this game is rigged and it’s obvious to see especially with the daily challenges and duplicate stickers. This game started out fun but now it’s a headache trying to win bc I’ve actually spent money smh. I want my money back.",Loss all its potential… Deleting.
4,2023-08-27 04:27:36,"Definitely glad they made it more fast paced but y'all need to make it where you can visit each others boards and drop off gifts along with being able to trade any type of cards to help complete sets, you do this you will make a killing in profit! Love the game always have before mobile 👍🏽",Lopez96
3,2023-08-25 20:58:53,I love this game and love playing it with my friends! The only major issue I have is that this game stole 50 dollars from me. I went to get one of the dice deals for 10 dollars but it kept giving me an error message so I did it four more times until I checked my account and realized they charged me for the dice but I never received it. Kind of hope they fix that,"Love the game, but 1 major issue"
1,2023-08-25 14:29:00,It’s not even fun anymore. I have invited a lot of friends and never got the dice that I was supposed to. The pink packs are supposed to give u a new card but they always give duplicates to cards I already have. Then you still only get 50 measly dice when u spend a lot of money to complete a board. Ppl are selling the 5 star stickers which are hard to come by already. My progress doesn’t load and update like it should for the challenges. There are so many things wrong with this game.,Game is boring now
5,2023-08-19 23:24:16,Hello my name is Natasha and I been playing this game for a year now at first it was a very bad experience but now it’s good! I wanted to suggest some things! Can you add a next opponent button like you did with the shutdown I robbed my mom a lot! Haha! Anyways have a nice summer or day! :),Imagine saying this game is trash! Your def missing out!
5,2023-07-17 16:04:30,This game is so addicting and fun you will love it if you play it I know the first day that you have the game don’t delete it. It might get boring on the first day but the second day that is so fun in the third day it just gets even better and better so what are you waiting for download it,Epic game
4,2023-08-18 03:02:07,"This game is very addictive; however, the glitches and bugs needs to improve. Reporting issues seem worthless at this point because there are so many “known issues “ being “investigated “ instead of fixed🫤 makes it impossible to enjoy",Good but needs improvement
3,2023-08-17 11:48:29,No real incentive to keep playing other than  it being a go-to to kill time!! Some times I can use 100 rolls and land in jail every other time around the board!! The AI hasn’t hit a double in two days!! Random?? Yea ok!! When things of value are on the line you can’t hit none of the square’s you need! Then there’s times where 20 rolls might be a mega windfall!! Make it make since!!,Nice but needs more!!
4,2023-08-16 00:09:53,I love the game but it’s starting to get boring we barely get new cards it’s way to hard to complete events 50 dice for every board completed is nuts also u spend more dice tryna get dice if getting 50 dice at level 100 is crazy and on me we need more insensitives for this game please n thank you also dice for any friends that joins would be nice,Needs fixing
1,2023-08-14 11:19:49,collecting stickers takes way too long and there needs to be a more effective way to “trade” them.. as of right now the only choice for trading is joining their facebook group and either A.) getting scammed out of your cards or B.) sitting there begging for someone to trade who asks for more in return than 1 sticker of equal value . Any game that requires facebook for access to the other half of it is a joke. Let alone being forced to join a sketchy facebook group with no kind of moderation/ rule enforcement whatsoever….,This game is awful
3,2023-08-13 13:40:26,You will not get the stickers you need without getting them sent to you from someone else. Good luck finding someone who will send to you. There isn’t enough time or rolls for you to complete The partner competetion unless your spending hundreds of dollars. I wouldn’t get expectations up thinking you’re going to finish the game. They don’t want you to collect everything.,Cannot Complete Sets
1,2023-08-13 11:35:13,I have had so many issues with this game. It’s all rigged giving me the lowest possible rewards not letting me load the game giving me duplicate 1 star stickers that no one needs spending tons of money with no outcome or rewards and currently I have 3000 rolls just chilling an I can’t even get the game to load. It’s not my service cuz everything else works fine. This has happened before an tons of people couldn’t play the game for a full day. Sick of having nothing but issues from this game.,Get a grip scopley
1,2023-08-03 03:34:20,Don’t even bother downloading this game…. Has no resemblance to Monopoly other than the images. This is just a click click click farming game.  You click to roll to move around the board for random dollar amounts in order to click to build random buildings.  Level up and click some more. Click to match. Click to roll.  It’s just automated farming with Zero strategy and Zero purpose.  I’d rather play those mini ad games during the ads on “free” click games.,Waste of time…. Incredibly boring!
1,2023-07-31 23:00:29,"I love the game and the concept but the developers created a cash grab for themselves the game is linked to a Facebook group full of scammers, and of course the developers ignore the actual players as long as they make their overhead it’s simple release all stickers less duplicates and give more rolls in an hour don’t stop the incoming dice because I hit 80 I should be still getting dice also instead of only trading stickers let us be able to send rolls as well I already uninstalled this cash grab good luck to you all",Cash Grab
3,2023-07-30 10:13:49,"I love monopoly but, to be honest, you’ll get bored with this… It’s repetitive… & it’s just too many ads on my screen, there is no need for 10 ads on my screen, covering up the sides of the board, nor do I want to see those same ads pop up 50 times when I get low on dice…. Other than that it’s fun but… I will be deleting the app just cause it’s a certain algorithm with it…",Fun but gets boring
2,2023-07-21 18:30:46,This game was all fun and kept me entertained when I was bored until today. I had over 88million dollars over 400 dice and was in the middle of a mega cash grab when it crashed. When it finally worked again I had lost all my money and had 0 dice. The map took me back TWO boards and it wants me to redo what I’ve already done. I don’t have the desire to try and get back what they lost so for that I will be deleting the app.,It was fun. Now I’m deleting the app.

Had big hopes for this game only to be dissatisfied. It’s not very interactive. You just press a “GO” button that generates your game for you. Completely boring, and not exciting. Don’t waste your time downloading. Also rated it 2 stars because it might be for some people, but definitely not the monopoly game one would hope for.",Nothing like monopoly
5,2023-07-15 14:14:05,This game is so addicting. It is so much fun to play and get revenge on your friends. It becomes a competition to see how much you can take from your friends. Only part I don’t like is waiting for your dice. Lol it is so worth it though. Happy building an empire and stealing your way to the top.,Prepare to be addicted

2,2023-07-05 18:44:03,"The game is definitely addictive but all day it has had issues, it crashes and then when you reopen it, it loads to 30% then crashes again. Also the amount of popups is ridiculous when you run out of dice you get 3 popups, when you open the app you get 3 popups(even if you just left the app), when you dont have enough money to build you get popups. Also the regeneration of dice is entirely too long.",Fun but having issues
1,2023-05-26 07:27:10,"The game has issues, beyond the ridiculous amount of ads before each play and as soon as you open the app, or even leave it for a brief second. There should be a revenge for heists, the way they’re set up with who you rob from and who steals from you should be changed. I’ve had a bank heist of the same player over 5 times in a row.

Hopefully people doing multiplayer are having a better time.",Repetitive and boring

The game has bugs which they refuse to fix no matter how many times I try to tell the (horrible) customer service. The little rewards for the amount of dice spent and the glitches that they refuse to fix that other people abuse has made this game almost unplayable for me now.

I started needing to spend real money to make some of the goals. No big deal at first.. I spend some amount of money on any game that keeps me entertained.   But then it escalated to the point where you need to spend $50-$100/week to complete your goals. Without hitting these marks, you don’t win the cute game pieces, you can’t win the dice prize packs and you stand no chance of advancing.   I give this game 1 star because this multi-billion dollar game does not care about anything except making their millions.",Just not worth your time
1,2023-09-15 17:15:25,"Where to start….well let’s talk about the guaranteed sticker bundle I bought a week before the last album ended. You know what I got…NOTHING! I contacted customer support? NOTHING!! I was unable to complete my album and still have not heard back. The prices for dice is ridiculous. I can spend 10 dollars on Board Kings and get 1500 dice plus stickers AND cash. You can actually visit your friends boards as well. How do you y’all rip off a game, and I mean take every aspect of BOARD KINGS and do it poorly. The new album is a joke.",BOARD KINGS IS BETTER

I’ve been trying to contact customer support but it’s the stupid computer thing and not a real human!! I want my rewards for finishing the cake and for completing all 4!!  I commented on multiple of your social media posts too. Hopefully this bad review gets your attention.

1,2023-09-07 21:20:09,The creators of this are slowly making it so you can't get very far without purchasing their dice which are priced outrageously high. Why spend money on this game just for other people to be able to steal it?   It's no different then someone stealing your hard earned money when your paying for dice to get the money to upgrade and people can just come on in an steal what you paid money for in bank heists and showdown...,Not that fun. Creators are money hungry and people can steal what you paid real money for.
4,2023-09-07 13:29:47,I’ve bought a couple of packs and since I’ve been buying packs everything is now $99 when my friends get the same pack offer for $15-$20 I don’t understand why. Other than that I love the game just wish everything didn’t cost $99 for me.,Packs costing different from other players
1,2023-09-06 06:10:24,"It’s extremely fun, the mini games, attacking your friends boards, completing the sets. The more I play the more you have to spend money to play. This new card season gives trash rewards for finishing, I’m talking 130 dice, it’s ridiculous. 8 free rolls an hour (for a total of 80) when to win any competition you need 1,000’s of rolls. It was fun but they’ve sucked that out of it. I’m using the last of my dice from finishing the last set but once that runs out and I’m back to 8 rolls an hour I’ll be done.","Fun, addictive but…"
4,2023-09-03 19:59:52,"I absolutely love this game, however I think there should be upgrades added. For example:  - use money in bank to buy rolls - use money in bank to buy stickers  - use money in bank to buy shields  - increase the # of daily sticker gifting  - allow a user to trade a single duplicate gold sticker for one they don’t have without having to reach 100 ⭐️ to trade   Overall this is a really fun game the game but would really like to see more features that your bank can be used for besides buying landmarks. Users shouldn’t only have to “purchase” rolls and special offers to fully enjoy the game!",Love the game need more features

Y’all don’t listen to your fanbase and customers cuz why did y’all add gold stickers to every album set now. Why are the rewards just pennies and nickels for each set. Why is the reward less for finishing the entire album.   Y’all need to make your money, I get it. But this is NOT the way. Just look at your Instagram page. Full of savages and people speaking facts.",New update is GARBAGE
3,2023-08-28 22:38:11,All in all the app is fun and easy to use. The gameplay is fun as well but small things that really could make it better like being able to trade gold cards. It makes no sense to have duplicates of cards you can’t even trade for or send to help finish collections. Other than that it’s nothing to complain about but I doubt that’ll change.,Could be better.
3,2023-08-27 20:05:58,"I like this game, don’t get me wrong but it’s impossible to finish all sticker sets. I understand it should be hard to do to keep people playing but even if you trade with friends, or even spend money, you will never receive the stickers you need. Ive played every single day, and spent money, I haven’t received a new sticker in weeks. It’s just really frustrating.",Impossible
2,2023-08-26 16:25:55,"Playing MonopolyGO is like Sisyphus rolling a boulder uphill only having to start over again and again. The game “rewards” are mostly, tantalizingly, out of reach again and again. I suppose investing in the developer’s vacation homes might extend the play but even that becomes lather, rinse, repeat. The graphics are great, the sounds satisfying, but the game play is redundant. It’ll take a while but you’ll ultimately feel fleeced whether time or money or both.",Ultimately boring
5,2023-08-26 05:59:52,"The new update has made the game faster, smoother and just a joy to play. Thank you to the devs for making this happen.

5,2023-08-13 08:22:56,I’ve purchased dice to complete the sets and once I got down to needing only 1 sticker I can no longer log into the game. I’ve tried to uninstall and install it again and still nothing… biggest scam to get people to spend money only to never complete the game😡😡,Monopoly Go

2,2023-08-16 15:55:27,So this game start of as really fun. But you’ll find out fast that the game has no end to it. You have people at way lower level able to hit you so if you’re a spending the only thing that will help you with is moving up which holds no value if everyone is treated the same. You can try to stack your money but the game will make sure you get rob and lose it all. Your level don’t matter so save your money and play for fun,Never Ending
3,2023-08-15 04:10:48,Awesome game however the cash boost was counting down while I was not rolling dice. This is while the game / system decides to reward me.   Love the rewards however out cash boost time should not be impacted by the system sending me rewards. Send them after the cast boost. I’m sure it happens during other bonuses and not just cash boost.   Pause the countdown or give rewards at a different tome. Thank you!   Also! We have to collect all the rewards which makes the game at a much slower pace. The faster it can be played in such a fast paced world the more people can play it.  Take the collect option out! We see what we won of course we want to collect. Just give me to us!   Great game!,I’m feel robbed!!
2,2023-08-14 15:41:12,It’s a good game don’t get me wrong. But when your barely having any dice or getting any of the things for the tournaments they have it hard to play the game. The baking tournament was fun. An I didn’t have any trouble completing it. But this new one is a lot harder to get the tokens to draw the amount is hard. As well as it doesn’t ever let anyone get the big amount on it. It’s hard to complete something if you can’t afford to spend money on the game.,It’s okish
4,2023-08-11 00:18:18,Great game to play with friends and family. If it wasn’t for running out of rolls I would probably be glued to it all day. The only thing I do not like is as you level up they only give you 50 rolls for completing a board instead of just maxing out your allotted amount rolls your are given based on your current level,Honest Review

It closes as soon as it gets to about 80 to 90. % loaded.  Your chat box was no help at all because you aren’t chatting with a tech person just a computer response.  I spent 50$ for dice and now I can’t even use them.,Game not loading and can’t get help from tech support
1,2023-08-11 20:41:25,I loved the game at first. New stickers every week from the packs made it somewhat feasible to move up in the game. Now? You get no new cards. You’ll get multiple duplicates of the same gold stickers that can’t be graded (stupid). You get a max of 8 dice an hour (ridiculous) and it’s almost impossible to advance in the game. I’ve spent a good chunk of money on this game JUST to advance… which is ridiculous. I just deleted the app.. it’s a shame cuz I loved it at first but now it’s become overrated (SMDH),It was fun at first but now it’s overrated
5,2023-08-08 18:04:32,"Easily one of the most addicting mobile games I’ve even bothered downloading in MONTHS.

This game got a lil crack in it, I do like it, love it even. But y’all can stop doing us dirty on the stickers.

2,2023-07-12 10:39:40,While the game itself will bring you hours of enjoyment you will also encounter some major bugs in the game. Buying features in this game is very costly. I have been trying to co tact customer support for the past three days about missing rewards. No one has answered me in the chat or gotten back to me. Other players have face the same lack of communication and support from the game’s admins. Don’t waste your money on this game.,Will Leave you high & dry!
3,2023-07-12 08:38:28,I love playing the game but it can also be super frustrating. The prizes on the color set wheel need to be updated getting 5 dice and 1 star stickers is ridiculous considering how much money we have to spend to get the wheel. If gold stickers cannot be traded or gifted stop giving players duplicates. Trading should be more secure. There are too many people on the official fb trading group scamming.,Addictive Game but with Flaws
4,2023-07-11 20:36:12,"It’s an amazing game, no ads, really entertaining, and addicting. I think the only problem with it is the rolls. I hate the fact that you have to wait a whole hour for only 5 rolls. Meaning it forces you to pay for rolls. Which in my opinion is stupid. But if they fix that, the game would be 10x better","Great Game, could use some work"
4,2023-07-11 19:14:43,I love the game very much! I just wish the time was lower on the dice. Because when you use all the dice u have to wait almost an hour to get just 5 more.

It use to be fun but now they’ve taken all the excitement away. Considering uninstalling it now.,Not worth playing anymore
3,2023-09-16 03:27:41,The game is so addicting. But they literally make it impossible to finish the sticker books. I’m in a million groups and we all need the same cards. It’s hard to keep dice. It just makes you feel defeated more often then not… I Bounce between keep playing and stop waiting my time because it’s not a game that’s made for you to ever win.,It sometimes feels impossible
5,2023-09-04 08:31:44,"I love the app, the boards are really nice and super relatable to real life travel trips. I love that it goes around the world, it aesthetically pleasing on the eye, and it is super fun especially the upgrade to the buildings!

2,2023-09-12 19:10:13,I’m on map 201 and I’m still missing about 12 gold stickers. That shouldn’t be so hard to get them. Obviously the more maps you complete the gold cards still aren’t a reward. I cashed in 600 duplicate cards and didn’t get a single new sticker I needed. Yes I really enjoy the game as you can tell by the map I’m on but I’m about to stop and find something new to play. Please see about making some of the stickers available.,Obtaining Stickers

I’m just having one problem with it ever since we did the partners to build cakes and that has ended, I can no longer play the game every time it loads. It says error. I’ve restarted my phone.

3,2023-09-11 19:45:06,"The only real issue I have with the game is when a 4 partner event is going on if your partner doesn’t play or doesn’t contribute there is no way to kick them to get a new partner, so you are doomed to fail especially if you get multiple partners doing nothing.

First I was double charged, (there’s still a charge at apple and they won’t let me buy anything else).  Second I’ve been playing and I would always joke and say it’s rigged well today I was spinning the wheel landed on 2000 then randomly jumped two spaces. I’m seriously considering uninstalling.

1,2023-09-04 16:53:41,I just updated or what I thought I just updated the new version only to discover that I have the same exact one that I had before. I’m going to uninstall because it doesn’t make sense to get a new version then have to look at the same version over again. I want the creators to stop giving us glimpses of certain features then take them down or away once you start playing .I’m very disappointed and frustrated with this game.😩😩😩😩😩😩,Frustrated
5,2023-09-02 01:33:55,Enjoy playing on down time and me time. Makes time go by really fast super quick to level up to next round such a twist to the game wish they it had where you could play on a board while using an app that would be fun.,Love it so much fun
5,2023-08-24 16:46:26,"This App is one of the best apps I have ever downloaded. No adds just deals, no required purchases needed for dice they gift you every day!

2,2023-08-31 13:25:04,I been playing everyday since the new album started. I basically finished all my albums except two. I need two gold stickers. I didn’t receive neither. Mind you I play everyday. I don’t spend money on the game though. They only show favoritism to the people who pay. I just deleted the game. I’m just over it. There’s no way I shouldn’t have completed the whole album. I wish I could show proof because I would.,The Game Is Rigged
3,2023-08-31 05:32:13,"This game is addictive and fun but it’s gotten to the point where it’s not becoming a fair game. We as a community playing this game, can’t trade gold stickers and it needs to happen especially on the last day before the albums end.

I was really enjoying the game but it’s just broken.",Game is Broken
3,2023-08-27 04:59:25,They game is fun and brings back some good times playing monopoly. Only issue I have is that game demands too much Pay2Win and it’s constant. I should not have to pay to advance in some daily’s or weekly. It’s also annoying that every time you can’t spin it always pops up to buy dice to keep playing. It would get a high rate but it’s clear that it was built with Greed to succeed!,Fun game but…
3,2023-08-16 18:39:28,The game itself is great but it’s very hard to get new stickers that you need and also need more rolls per hour. After a certain level you should be able to receive certain stars 1-5 they give a loooot of duplicates that aren’t needed after a while which is frustrating and can’t keep enough rolls to continue without purchasing rolls,Sticker duplicates
1,2023-08-19 18:12:31,"I spent money on this game for the first time to come 1st place in a tournament. I set a timer for the expiration of the tournament and it was supposed to be the highlight of my day. To my surprise they started a new tournament and I was deprived of my 2,500 rolls , missing sticker pack, and 500+M dollars. One star you guys must compensate and gift me for having to go through this entire process JUST to receive what’s due to me. (They estimate 5 days to receive rewards IF proven!)

5,2023-08-15 20:07:37,I love this game lol 😂😂tho there could be some fixes I think you should be able to trade all cards that would help out so much and during the events if we got extra we should be able to gift them to another person,Ideas
5,2023-08-08 21:46:49,"Is like a casino slot, fun fast paced, can wager as many dice per roll.

Really good game.",Fun!  Great game on the go.
2,2023-08-15 19:34:56,The game is definitely fun but I’ve almost never seen a so blatantly obvious it’s got the game rigged. One event you will need to land on the utilities and tax spots and you will land in the corners or railroads nonstop and then the next day the event will be to land on Railroads and it’s non stop the other. The sticker game is also pretty silly as I have several of cards that’s non tradable and I have tons of them but still missing over a dozen other cards,Fun and exciting gun but definitely has some big cons
5,2023-07-07 05:09:50,"I absolutely love this game, but lately it seems that my profile is frozen on a certain screen. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the game x amount of times and it still does the same thing. I even played on a guest profile with no issues.",Frozen
2,2023-08-03 19:32:01,They pull you in at the beginning until you are hooked then make it harder to play you have to wait hours for just 7 dice if you made it to that point and the albums are hard to complete unless you are spending money to get them. I’ve never spent money on a game before but this one I have spent at least $60 which I am ashamed to say I will be deleting this game smh….,This game is addictive it’s worse than gambling don’t do it!

1,2023-06-27 05:20:56,"Overall the game is somewhat fun, but the system is rigged and full of bots. Scopely siphons your bank when heisted and take upwards of 90% of your funds when the user actually takes maybe 1%. Scam to get you to make in-app purchases. Bots or players manipulating the game always win tournaments so you have no chance at the good prizes. Also they are too lazy to implement an in-app trading feature and force you to use Facebook to “trade” with strangers and use the honor system and you usually get scammed out of your cards by low life’s.",Rigged

5,2023-04-30 21:15:57,It’s not a bad game but waiting an hour for 5 dice is a scam and I’d understand if it was like 10 dice instead of 5 and people are just paying to basically win more dice and it skips doubles when you are in jail to please make an update for less time for 5 rolls or give more dice for an hour,MonopolyGO

3,2023-11-02 18:14:45,I would absolutely give this game a five star rating if it didn’t cost so much to get rolls.  Also it takes too long to complete any cards to get rolls.   Almost impossible to get ahead on rolls.  I have to stop playing without any shields up because I can’t afford to buy extra rolls. It’s actually a really fun game ….. if your rich and can afford to play,Cost way too much

Your parents must be so proud of you.",Just like real life!

It takes an hour to generate 8 dice, getting a gold sticker in near impossible, keep in mind that gold stickers can’t be traded so why allow the game to generate duplicate gold stickers that can’t be traded. As you get higher in levels the amount of money needed to complete a board is so high that it’s impossible to earn money to complete the board.  I’m done playing this game",Don’t bother downloading
1,2023-10-07 03:26:15,The game started out as fun with great potential however it is coded to make you spend money. People that are not your friends are allowed to knock down your buildings back to back and there is nothing you can do about it due to not being able to block or remove them. The stickers are a joke as you keep getting duplicates even if you buy them. They have added a dice increase as a prize but it’s an absolute waste of a prize. This game has so much potential.,Money Grab!!!
1,2023-10-06 05:46:18,Game would be fun if the makers weren’t so greedy you don’t get enough rolls to be competitive without having to buy rolls the game also knows what you need and will purposefully not give it and the sticker system is a joke big chest cost 2500 stars and each sticker is only 1-3 stars mind you the big star stickers are hard to get because you go against people who pay to win so now it goes back to having to pay to be competitive just save yourself the headache seriously,Money grab

4,2023-10-03 13:47:14,Had good and bad. Game is kinda fun but I haven’t received any new stickers in over 3 weeks. That makes it very hard to play the game because you have no dice. Tried buying but was double charged twice and didn’t receive money from the second charge so I won’t purchase again.,Up and down
1,2023-09-29 23:14:37,Honestly this game is a waste. It's all built around getting you to spend more money for goals you will never reach unless you spend a ton of money. The goals are unattainable. The biggest frustration are cards. I've had multiple albums at 8/9 for weeks with no change and not a single new card through the game. The only way I have received new cards or closed albums recently has been trading. There doesn't seem to be any real way to actually affect the game.,Waste
5,2023-09-28 13:40:52,Played game fine prior to iOS 17.1 update installed this morning. Went to play game after update completed and keep getting “Error occurred requiring hame to restart.” It never actually restarts though … just loops the error message.,Great until recent software update

5,2023-08-27 05:44:52,It’s a fun game because I have been playing for a month now and have felt like it was a real game but on my phone and my kids have having fun on this game too they’re like 11 and 13 they love it so much and have fun that’s why it’s a fun game for me and my kids and it will be a fun game for you😍😍🥰🥰,It’s a fun game
5,2023-08-26 23:54:52,This game is fun my family and friends and I play it. It’s hilarious when my son is upset with me and shuts down all of my landmarks and when I randomly get an alert that my best friend stole 3million from me. The stickers get on my nerves but if it was too easy I wouldn’t want to play. I love thé challenges.,Fun game
5,2023-08-22 11:22:10,"We need more rolls and money when we’re higher up on the board buying landmarks is expensive the more you reach the end of the game.

3,2023-08-26 12:49:35,Love the game but y’all make it impossible to complete whole sticker albums. Every time I’m 5 or 6 from the end all I get is doubles and the ones needed are of course untradeable and require a magenta color sticker pack which is impossible to get. Please make it easier for dedicated players to at the very least  be able to earn more magenta sticker packs or gold cards. Thanks,Impossible
4,2023-08-25 21:40:16,I think we should have the option to buy the missing stickers from the shop so we don’t have to pay more for a sticker pack and then not get the sticker we need or be able to trade them in at a black market sticker shop,Option to buy stickers from shop
4,2023-08-22 23:29:53,What is the point of still playing the game if I have to chase the same cards again that took me forever to get the first time? We all know it will be hard to get them and trading is sometimes not an option. Game is fun but I need a new album…,"Starting card album over with same one, WHY?"
3,2023-08-21 12:50:36,"This game is fun however, I been cheated out my dice multiple times due to the game network failing. Sometimes I win events and don’t even get the prizes I win, i don’t know why. They give you the same stickers over & over.

3,2023-08-19 00:30:47,At first I loved this game. All my friends we’re talking about it on social media so I decided to play. I very quickly learned it is a money grab. The cards needed to advance are very hard to get. Once you run out of dice you have to wait every hour to get more and even then it’s only enough for a few rolls. The only way to advance is by purchasing dice and cards. Not fun anymore.,The Hype is Gone

Each time I start on one device, it asks for me to load and then type confirm to delete the game to be loaded on the other device.  Not seem less at all. I double checked and it’s not me.   Other than that, not too bad, but the cross various mobile devices thing is a real pain and should be like other games.",Okay game
5,2023-08-12 16:11:47,"I love playing this game but my only complaint is that we can’t trade gold stickers why would you give us duplicates of gold stickers if we can’t do nothing with them I feel like the game would go a lot smoother if we could trade gold stickers….MAKE IT HAPPEN , AND WHEN WE START OVER WE NEED NEW STICKER SETS",Trading Gold Stickers
4,2023-08-13 05:55:34,"Would have given 5 stars if the dice was not so limited and the stickers are moderately hard to get. As of now dice is scarces and event like baking and now the cars require lots of it, which doesnt help the situation. Yes you get stickers every now and then for free and in events but those are 1-3 stars. The 5 ones are hard to come by, needless to say the gold ones",Dice & sticker
2,2023-08-13 02:02:13,"I really like this game.. but honestly I’m starting to get bored from waiting for dice so I can actually play.  I get it, it’s a free game with no ads.. and you want players to spend $, but an hour for only 5 dice to start the game off isn’t fun at all. I now get 7 per hour which is still a joke. Either give us more dice per hour or shorten the wait time..this game will get deleted soon enough if this issue continues.",Needs a ton of improvement
5,2023-08-08 06:27:38,I’m so inlove with playing this monopoly game so happy my sister told me about it now I can’t stop play it plus I just started playing this game and getting good at it I would advise everyone to try it out I’m sure you guys will love it just as much as I do thistle a promise 💯🥳,Everyone should try it out!

5,2023-08-03 23:49:56,Come one guys this game is great but the drop rate is too low and ppl are monopolizing the stickers through other means come own Hasbro we need some better drop rates to stop these scammers and pirates from making the game less enjoyable,Wish the rare 5 stars had better drop rate
5,2023-08-03 01:44:11,Absolutely love this game! However I do feel as though there should be more opportunities to win dice instead of money. The dice shouldn’t be renewed once you’re under 70 rolls. Maybe try to revise the way the dice are distributed! Other than that love this game.,The way dice are distributed should be revised
5,2023-08-02 22:31:37,This is a great game . fun family competitions 10/10 would recommend . however the only downfall is you have to wait an hour for FIVE rolls . those five rolls are gone within 30 seconds . i wish they would make it easier to acquire more rolls .,i need more rolls
5,2023-07-17 03:15:54,I used to love this game but I’ve noticed as I get to higher levels the chances of me getting cards I need never happens. I have duplicates galore but never get any new cards or any of the gold or 5 star cards which makes me not want to play. That should really be fixed .,😩
3,2023-07-22 01:58:33,It was fun at the beginning now not so much … I feel like if I purchase anything with my money and it has stickers in it I should get a new sticker. I’ve been collecting old stickers since I’ve completed the first few sets. And we should have a challenge like the cake making again since that one was over when will the new challenge happen ?,New stickers!
2,2023-07-20 15:16:25,"This game is nothing close to any monopoly board game, it is more like a typhoon, not the actual game. I would have loved if we got to play regular style monopoly online, but this wasn’t close. It is confusing how to play at first, since you are learning a game called monopoly, but nothing close to the game we have been playing for years. The only reason this is two star is because it is my favorite board game.",Not what you expect at all. Don’t install
4,2023-07-19 21:54:16,So I absolutely LOVE this game and I spend more on it then I’d like to admit lol but one thing y’all can fix is stop giving us extras of cards we can’t even trade like what’s the point? Please just stop the concept of the gold cards is great However giving us extras of those is ridiculous because we can’t do anything with them,Awesome game
2,2023-07-18 16:41:54,It is a fun game I like it and hate it at the same time because I’ve also been ripped out of so many rewards . Wrote them and they did nothing . I also receive the same stickers over and over and unfortunately can’t trade because my last 7 are gold stickers and it’s annoying . Can’t hold dice either when your higher up in the game they make everything impossible for you .,Fun but irritating
5,2023-07-16 15:12:59,It’s a fun game but the higher you are in the boards the harder it is to get new stickers and the  golden ones you can’t trade but still get more of them than you can use it should be where no matter what you have you can trade them if they are extra,Fun game
5,2023-07-12 20:00:20,"Anyone who says this is a pay to win or pay to advance game, they are wrong. What this game actually is. A total fantastic blast of a good time.

4,2023-07-06 03:50:16,Love the game!! It truly is  addicting but I wish it was easier to get new stickers in the game instead of getting so many duplicates.  People are selling the stickers on eBay because they’re so hard to come by.  Little unfair for a free game.    I also think if we’re trading in stars that you should ONLY get new stickers.,Love the game only a few concerns
5,2023-07-05 23:58:53,I completed the task to receive the 850 dice and I have not received any do to freezing.  I could not get on the game because when loading it always stopped at 30% loading. So I I had to delete the app and redownload the app. I never received my reward.,Monopoly go
5,2023-06-30 21:22:16,The game IS AMAZING it’s a whole other level 🤩 My ONLY cons about this game is I WISH every time (in general) you land on free parking/prison visit you get 5 dices and the  GO PASS ON top of them giving you money they add dices to it as well.  But the game overall is GREAT!  I see this game making money and leveling up on the future as it goes!  Great job! Monopoly ❤️,OKAAAYY! MONOPOLY-GO!
4,2023-07-05 23:18:17,Since the upgrade two hours ago the game won’t even load which is super aggravating and secondly the pay to play… please fix the bugs so we can even play and the pay to play is ridiculous if you ask me… if it’s not fixed soon so I can log in I guess it was fun for a while…,Love this game BUT….
3,2023-07-05 17:57:02,I’ve truly enjoyed playing the game with family and friends but after I spent money on the app it kicked me out and keeps saying error when trying to load. I’ve tried everything. I’ve even deleted the app and reinstalled it.. hopefully this bug will be fixed soon and I don’t lose all my progress and money I’ve spent,Fun but it’s no longer working

3,2023-05-27 04:29:35,The game is fine but it tries to make you buy something every second. And I personally feel like it tries to rig itself when ever you are close to a milestone. Which may force people to spend money to make sure they reach a goal. Overall I feel like it most players spend money to surpass others instead of actually playing.,Pay To Win

1,2023-04-19 08:26:22,How this is legal to make games centered around nothing but in app purchases and designed like slot machines to tap into our lizard brains and make you want to pay for 5 dice rolls instead of waiting the hour.   There really is no game here except they give you 100 dice rolls quickly as you’re trying to figure out what all this app has to offer only for you to quickly run out and be flooded with prompts for you to purchase more.   There is nothing to this game at all except a cash grab for suckers.,Should be illegal

At the begging the game was so fun like so much fun and you can make friends in Facebook groups and get and give help for the events. BUT after a while you get fed up with the fact that you have to spend real money to finish the event.    So frustrating when there is a boost that is suppose to aid you in completing stuff and you wait for it all day. Then nothing zip nada. You use 300 rolls in hopes of getting a card you need because you have your properties set up for majors gains during a wheel boost but nothing happens. You get no new cards.

I won’t be spending money on it anymore because they do not give that opportunity to even finish the sticker thing.,Love the game but…..
4,2023-08-23 13:11:56,"It’s a very fun game. However, it’s hard to get the sticker needed to get the prizes unless 1) you buy more dice, or 2) join the Facebook trading group where people scam you out of your stuff as you have to friend them in your game and then they basically railroad you and take everything. People are very crazy about this game.",Fun Game but…
2,2023-08-22 17:44:01,"As many of us have enjoyed this game, we are as equally frustrated with this game.  Some people have stopped playing all together because we are spending money to get dice for this game to keep giving us the same 1, 2, & 3 🌟 cards.  When you upgrade your boards, you still get the same 50 dice, although the amount of money you have to pay to get to the next board is utterly ridiculous.  We NEED MORE DICE AND BETTER CARDS IN THESE PACKS‼️",This IS A RIP OFF
5,2023-08-08 16:10:13,The game is so fun the Wild West is what I’m on as a lucky kid his game is great everyday I play it and I love the stickers that’s kinda all I care about is the stickers except for that some of them are very bad still I like them also I have this world map puzzle board and a monopoly board and I act like it’s monopoly go lol.,Too fun
4,2023-08-17 04:39:49,My game has froze and I’m missing out on my freebies and just unable to play. It didi this once before and you guys fixed it but it’s doing it again and this time the has been dark over the last 3 or4 cities I’ve built and how do I get my rolls that I missed while this is happening?,Game froze can’t play
1,2023-08-15 20:05:54,Because of the fact you can’t change teammates on an event if you just happen to get the wrong one who doesn’t contribute anything at all you’re just stuck with not finishing the event because of it. Would be 100x better if you could switch teammates so you can find someone who isn’t completely useless. Have since uninstalled because I did almost the entire event by myself compared to all of my teammates.,Waste of time and money if you decide to spend
4,2023-08-10 01:01:40,"It a very addictive game and rather simple. Which is great, but I wish there was more we could do, such as respond to attacks, fix the buildings that were attacked, maybe create our own people or play with each other in a monopoly game like having tournaments! But even w/o all that this game is a lot of fun to play and pass the time.",Great game
5,2023-07-05 23:32:42,The game has a few bugs in it still it is kicking my family and me out of it non stop we can’t even have family time on it and play without issues occurring! (Fix it ASAP!),The game is kicking me and my family out non stop
3,2023-07-27 14:47:48,It’s been WEEKS since I got a new card in a deck on the game. Everyone is looking for the same cards in the trading groups. It’s a bit insane how many duplicates there is. It seems the only way (possibly) to get a new card is get the pink deck which also seems completely unattainable. Fix this. You’ve got a amazing game here but it’s getting ridiculous.,Only 3 stars because…
4,2023-07-24 13:40:03,"It is really a 4.9/5! The game is truly amazing! It’s a wonderful game. Very addictive and easy to play with friends. It’s not as traditional as the original monopoly board game is, so that’s why i took off .1 because it wasn’t what i was expecting from monopolygo. But it’s not a problem that takes away from the game, just my personal opinion.",Amazing!
1,2023-07-21 00:13:37,I don’t know what this game is but it’s some kind of mutant form of monopoly only good point about it is that it’s free so that you can delete it after you realize how pointless this thing is. You don’t play against other people you just torture them from time to time and then they get revenge on you from time to time it’s a time sink to draining of money if you’re foolish enough to pay for more turns for something that has no value and that you play zero against other people,Not monopoly
2,2023-07-13 02:16:35,"I was enjoying this game in the beginning. I've even spent over $50 with the company. I'm on level 70 after a week of playing. So I've invested time & money. What I do not appreciate is when you get free rolls, you don’t see them added to your game. You look at your rolls before and after, and they’re not moving. Technically glitches while playing. Yes, it returns to where you left off, but it keeps crashing.",Stealing rolls & glitches
1,2023-07-13 00:29:01,"The game was fun at first but as you progress the game gets less friendly. It’s harder to get dice and the game aims for you to spend real cash to get them. You do get stickers and when you complete an album you get dice but what use is it when they give you the same stickers over and over. You win events but it’s extremely hard. Also, when you compete a board they should give you 500 dice. What is 50 dice going to do?? I would not recommend this game.",Waste of time
2,2023-07-10 18:32:03,I tried so hard to bake my cakes I was so close but having one partner who didn’t try not one time causes me to miss out on top prize my other  3 cakes I had great partners and would have made my 4th if partner would have helped it would have been nice to be rewarded with something for putting in the effort and one draw back I hate about this game is how long it takes to refill your rolls the game is very addictive but starting to hate it,Baking game
1,2023-07-07 23:19:40,Beware you may really enjoy your time on this app but if there are bugs support is hard to reach when you lose access to your account and have to start over.

Here comes some random person named Ryan to bank heist everything I worked hard for. The problem is that I never added anyone named Ryan and he is no where to be found on my friends list. I reached out to cyst service about this and there was no explanation. Magically i’m unable to even log in as of today.,Bank Heists By Ppl Not on Friends List
5,2023-07-04 02:39:18,So far the only thing I don’t like about this game is that you MUST use FACEBOOK for friends. Unlike other games that don’t require Facebook. You shouldn’t NEED Facebook for your friends list because NOT everyone’s friends play the same type of games.,Could Be Better!!!

They affect nothing but sometimes someone else (who you never see or interact with) will it it and you earn. You are not involved in any of this process, it’s completely auto done.  You’ve landed on a mini game!  Mini game 1) click on ‘opponent’s’ city building. You make money. Oh and your opponent is almost definitely a bot.  Mini game 2) Bank heist!

A lot of individuals have made it that you need to trade a high amount of stars for fellow sticker set, and it makes it unfair when you only have five in a day, it would be more beneficial for both player first, and the game, if we were able to trade more than five a day, because who provides players with more opportunities to play the game",Trades
2,2023-11-07 15:38:48,"The game itself is fun and almost addictive but the in game economy is very predatory and encourages and tricks the player into spending money for little in return.

5,2023-10-31 05:40:29,Love the concept of the game! (Definitely could give more dice each time you complete a board and could use a few extra tweaks) but all in all it’s super fun and definitely addicting. Always new events and prizes to win prolly never stop playing it 😂,Awesome game
5,2023-10-14 22:19:24,"I’m a huge fan of the board game but this is an enjoyable twist. I like the different challenges and goals.

1,2023-10-30 15:09:33,I have had so many times where it’ll give me the challenge to collect a whole bunch of dice. As I’m close to completing that Challenge it’ll change to a completely different one and cheat me out of the rewards. I have had this happen about 5 separate times and I’ve had the game for less than 3 weeks. I have completely been livid. There’s also situations where it’ll cheat me out of the board rewards.

An example of this is the latest tournament becoming more difficult to get the top prize. Playing consistently and using what the game gives to you is not enough to get anywhere in this game. The further you get the more and likely you will have to spend money. I would suggest never downloading this game.",Ridiculous
3,2023-10-25 17:36:50,"In the beginning this game was fun, now it’s losing the fun. You have to wait months just to get one card no holds ( even though it’s a gold trade it’s low level golds ) and peg e only gives 2-5 pegs we can never finish it especially when every time you play it starts all over. This game has lots the potential to be the greatest game scopely has become money hungry",Sad
3,2023-10-20 13:08:45,I love the game but I see we all have the same complaint and no changes. There is no reason why we should be getting the same stickers over and over.

Your math is not mathing MONOPOLY!,STICKERS!
3,2023-10-17 18:47:23,"Fun to play; however, it would be nice to not keep getting the same stickers.  Especially for those that play every day.  For the golden stickers not allowed to be gifted,  they’re certainly not given out.

5,2023-09-21 02:54:35,I love this game and I usually get bored quick but they keep giving dice and making sure that we not only have rivalry battles but also work together just wish it was easier to do the events and get new stickers.,Most addicting game!!

Simply opening the game, you have to go through 5-7 different screens of offers before you’re allowed to roll the die.   Now let’s talk about substance. This game requires absolutely ZERO cognitive function or skill. I’m left to wonder how this is even labeled a game?! Imo, they should delete this from history and try again with a more engaging and fun game loop.   You will see everything this game has to offer in about 5 minutes of play. I’m convinced at this point that even a monkey could play this game and he/she too would get bored.  If you’ve read all of this, please don’t waste your time on this app. Plenty of other exciting, engaging, and entertaining games that are offered on the App Store.",No Substance!!!!
4,2023-10-03 09:35:24,This game is fun but it can be a bit time-consuming. It’s hard to play when you can’t get that many free dice rolls or new stickers.

The higher you get the levels just repeat and get more expensive. The sticker collecting is a joke. I thought it was bad the last time but this new collection is almost impossible to get the gold stickers unless you pay. 80 dice is a joke. I am pretty much done with this game.

4,2023-08-05 21:27:58,How about making it easier to collect new stickers to complete sets and albums instead of giving us the exact same ones in multiple duplicates repeatedly! Very aggravating to not be able to finish sets due to your lack of giving out new stickers!,Stickers
5,2023-07-29 05:33:12,Just another monopoly. Glitches to much and the way they give the stickers are pointless. No strategy what so ever. Just simply rolling and building and if you want more rolls you must pay. Liked it at first then realized the game itself doesn’t want you to win.,Okay game
5,2023-07-16 01:57:46,The side game such as collecting the stickers is not easy! I keep getting duplicates and the ones I need. The trading groups on Facebook are not helpful. Please make the side games easier the finish so we can do what we all need to do is buy property and make this Monopoly money!!!,Collecting Stickers
1,2023-07-26 22:15:26,It’s funny that the review that is featured is from April. And only the good ones are featured. Your game is crap. You don’t actually move the spaces your dice say. You can spend money for cards and still get crap cards or excess amount of gold cards you can’t trade. And I’ve found if you spend money you get better rolls. But still can’t get the cards you need. And recently it automatically takes your x100 from you. It used to be it didn’t take it until you were under 100 rolls.,Crap
5,2023-07-16 01:32:32,It’s better because it’s free and I Dont need to worry about losing pieces. And because I can’t play a board game of monopoly in the car on a road trip. But with monopoly go I can. And those are a few reasons why monopoly go is better.😊😊😊,Why monopoly go is better than the board game monopoly
5,2023-07-14 14:04:33,This game is amazing and bring back old time fun with Facebook friends and family. Only issue is the amount of dice and how often you’re rewarded dice to achieve some of these impossible task. 50 dice is not enough when your about level 50..,"Game amazing, but this dice shortage"

2,2023-07-10 11:03:44,Little chance of completing sticker books even while trading stickers with friends and family. My whole family was playing and now almost all have stopped. It is fun for a while but none of us will be playing long term. Perhaps that is why they are constantly begging you to buy their packages??

2,2023-07-05 19:13:25,"Starts off fun, then after a few days the game becomes glitchy causing the app to restart and you lose out on rolls. Happens enough in a day to where you lose the interest of playing or opening the app. No customer service and pop up ads trying to convince you to spend money on the app. If you’re looking for a game that is like the board game monopoly this isn’t it, but will occupy your time",Glitches and bugs

1,2023-06-19 18:26:49,I loved this game but now this game is glitching pretty bad it has happened twice the main point of the game is the dice I had 700 dice and it disappeared I screenshot it tried getting in contact with customer service (which is impossible) the chat is automated and they said it would get back with me but how they have no information from me I had my multiplier on 50 with 700+ dice I never took my eyes away from the screen I watch them all go away $40 worth of dice gone,Game is good but your dice goes missing
5,2023-05-09 02:01:22,The levels should increase the amount of dice especially since the cost of the areas increases I’m on level 5o and come on now 50 dice. That’s the same as the first level. Stickers also need to change the higher up you go.  It a fun game but costly,Levels

1,2023-06-01 13:31:14,Had this game for a couple of days before they started bringing LGBTQ+ Pride crap into it. Deleted it as soon as I seen that. Stop forcing this onto people. Most of us don't want to see it. These kind of people are trying to lead us away from God and the family. They don't want us to procreate and raise up strong men and women because we are a threat to their system. We are a threat to satan. That is why they stand for EVERYTHING that goes against God and what he intended for us. Don't be fooled by their propaganda.,Stop bringing Pride into things!!!!
1,2023-05-13 02:50:41,"Honestly. This game is getting tiresome. There’s no reason to keep playing if we can’t even trade gold cards. Yeah I get that they are an investment. But WHAT is the point of getting multiples of them if we can’t trade them. Also, when we need them and click on the card it tells us to ask the group to trade. Why is that even an OPTION when we can’t trade them. About to delete the game since it’s just getting boring.   Until they update it, I’m done.",Multiple gold cards that can’t be traded

5,2023-04-12 20:27:51,I love this game it does not have adds and it dons not require Wi-Fi or internet it is a fun road trip game or a game you can play anywhere I could play this all day every day it’s exactly like what it is in the adds and it’s exactly like monopoly but even more I definitely recommend!

3,2023-11-11 02:07:40,You guys should make it an option to use our money in the bank to purchase chests that contain stickers! Would make it a lot easier on us to obtain new stickers!

I don’t think it’s right that I cashed in all them cards and only got one card that I needed and I can’t get dice  anymore without spending money I think something is really really wrong here,I feel scammed
3,2023-11-06 11:16:17,This game was fun but it’s been 7weeks since I’ve gotten a new sticker. I keep getting the same stickers and have opened my vault 3 times. They should allow you to steal dice/rolls and stickers. That would be a game changer as well as the opportunity to have more building events (cars/toys/cake etc).

2,2023-08-02 18:08:53,"They say it’s free but, it’s not. They constantly want you to buy dice. I don’t want to. If you want to play this fun game, you have to spend money on stupid dice. They help you with cash, that is not a problem, but if you want to keep going on the board without waiting the whole day for your dice to refill, you’ll be spending a nice amount. They should allow more dice, more faster. Monopoly go, stop having such a tight grip on the dice!",It’s ok here’s why:
5,2023-07-27 14:19:42,I love this game but I get mad when people shut me down but me and my family play it all the time! It’s the best game for a family and it’s perfect for my little cousins age! This is the best app I have been on! Thank you so much for making this app I love it so much I appreciate!!,Monopoly Go is the best game!
4,2023-07-28 22:02:59,"The game is fun, however I think being able to buy rolls won’t your Monopoly money or even trade rolls with friends would be a good add on to the game. I enjoy playing it but I run out of rolls and on certain levels of the events it’s almost impossible to get the higher rolls gifted. But other than that, the game is fun:)",I think…
3,2023-07-28 01:07:10,"Well I tried. I played this game faithfully for weeks and have loved it. But lately I can’t seem go get enough money to finish anything. Any time I get close, I run out of rolls, then get robbed before I get more rolls. When I finally get a decent number of rolls, I never land on anything worth landing on. Seems like the further you get, the more the algorithm works against you. So I’m out.",Stalled out
5,2023-07-27 12:39:57,"This game has always been a classic family staple board game and they just took it up a notch. I love everything about it except the amount of money you have to put in sadly but that’s capitalism for you. The UI is stable and the game fluid, add better tutorials.",Loved the revamped version
5,2023-07-20 21:07:03,If you love monopoly this game is for you! This game is super fun I really love this game and it’s like coin master! If you don’t know what coin master is it’s a game where you have to build your city! And I love both games best games to play when your bored. I have one thing to say it’s not an internet free game!,Best monopoly game ever!
4,2023-07-25 16:48:59,Its crazy to be at level 86 and still waiting on cards to finish set but constantly getting the same cards that I don't need… Ive traded duplicates in for chest twice with still no luck as well and tried to trade in trade groups. Buying dice is one thing BUT CAN WE GET AN UPDATE TO PURCHASE CARDS AT THIS POINT THIS GAME IS STARTING TO BE UNINTERESTING BECAUSE YOUR STUCK !,Game is very fun but gathering certain cards is a complete headache
2,2023-07-25 13:08:10,This game was fun and was very addicting but now it’s very boring. You can’t even do anything with the limited amount of dice and it’s hard to advance in the competition because you can’t land on anything with 80 dice and if you do it doesn’t give you much because you are betting so low. I think the dice should at least go up as we complete the boards the game is now geared towards  making you pay for dice.,No longer fun
5,2023-07-18 20:16:25,"I have always loved monopoly and I have several themed board games. This is top 3 of my favorite monopoly games! Super easy to play, super fun mini games, the sound of the dice is very satisfying, what else more can you ask for?? 5/5 if I could rate it higher I would.",Crazy addicting!!
5,2023-07-10 12:54:16,"I love this game, I actually was able to make it to level 50 within a few days. My only thing is as you level up why are we only getting 50 dice, shouldn’t the number be going up with ever new board we complete? Just saying..",Great Game BUT
5,2023-07-07 18:14:33,This game is so awesome I feel like I could play all day and I just love playing it with my friends and family getting to knock down and get money is like super awesome and also being able to move different places which is so awesome I just love it so much,Monopoly
4,2023-07-09 12:24:38,Game is wonderful to play now reason I give 4 stars is because prices for dice are ridiculous for the amount you are getting if it’s was $1.99 for 500 I can except that .I would pay but $1.99 for only 95 dice that to much . We all need make our money but as a business owner myself sorry price are high. Game is awesome great creator!!!,Awesome
3,2023-07-08 13:17:17,"This game has kept me entertained for the past couple days. It even had me wanting to purchase more dice, so i can continue to roll. Which i NEVER purchase extras off any game. This one time i get ready to purchase and a pop up states unable to purchase come back later. I was shocked, i restarted and re-download the game and still same message.",Fun but broken
5,2023-07-04 18:15:54,"I love how it is fast paced, you can do auto roll if you want, it doesn’t seem “rigged” in the fact that you don’t always get the same thing on the bank heist. You actually will get the big amount sometimes! Highly recommend!",Love it!!! 🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
3,2023-07-06 01:03:49,"Up until the most recent update it was great, now the game only loads to 30% and then gives an error saying it needs to restart. Watching it do this 5-10 times in a minute on 5G and/or WiFi without loading in or on the rare occasion it does let me in and t let's me play for maybe a minute and then boots me out of the game due to an ""error"" again","Good, but"
3,2023-07-05 19:55:06,The game keeps glitching when it’s trying to load it’s not going passed 27% right now and before that it was 30% I enjoy playing this game I really do but I hate that it’s not loading right away like it was before so I am giving 3 stars just cause I do enjoy the game and I’m not going to delete it but please fix the issues as soon as possible please and thanks,Game stalling
3,2023-06-11 21:09:28,"The only way to keep playing the game (without having to wait for hours) is by paying a crazy amount of money. And even then, $1.99 gets you 20-30 more minutes of play time. I’ve played other games with similar models and they typically allow more gameplay without having to spend exorbitant amounts of money.",Fun for 45 minutes
1,2023-06-26 07:12:17,"First let me sayi don’t mind paying a reasonable amount to play. This game starts reasonably, perhaps even cheaply. A few days into it you find yourself paying about a nickel a die. Yes you can be patient and get a few rolls free, but to advance more than a few steps gets impossible without buying “stickers” packs and even that is hit or miss, because you don’t know what you’re buying. You can trade stickers but some are reserved and untradeable. So you just get sucked in.",Got so expensive I lost interest.
5,2023-05-11 21:56:21,"I saw this on an add and figured it wouldn’t be anything like the real game but I decided to give it a shot since I love the original board game, I have it a shot and I loved it. It’s the original game and more, it also gets more difficult as you move up.",Extremely Addictive
1,2023-06-06 19:50:08,"This game is literally nothing. You just press a button. It’s a braindead game and I don’t see how it has 5 stars. It hasn’t wronged me in anyway but the game is just boring, uninteresting, and overall terrible. I’d rather watch cars go around in a circle for 4 hours than play this crap. How about you just make a monopoly game that’s a mobile version of the board game with the big kicker of not loading the dice. Make it completely random. You’ll have an immediate 10k downloads.",What even is this?
5,2023-05-01 18:13:21,"This game is so much fun and addictive, especially when you can play with friends you know. It puts a different spin on Monopoly. After playing this for 10 minutes, you will never want to play the board version again!",Love it
5,2023-11-01 16:37:48,"Enjoyable game, just crashes too much as of recently. I even updated my app yesterday, and today it crashes everytime I level up my boards. Genuinely enjoyable but something has to give.",Why is it crashing so much?
1,2023-11-06 22:04:29,I contacted customer service gave them ALL my info and instead of working with me they closed my ticket and said my account couldn’t be recovered. I just made a purchase yesterday and included that receipt plus a bunch of screenshots and info that they asked for and nothing. Doesn’t even seem like they tried to help. There was zero back and forth. No conversation. I’m almost at 10k net worth and I’m on the 2nd album. I don’t want to lose this account.,Account progress lost
1,2023-11-03 13:49:24,This is a money grab game if you don’t have money to throw away don’t get it . You spend spend and spend and they give you nothing. They give you the same  cards that you don’t need and 8 dice every hour don’t for get the 20 dice every 8 hours just ridiculous. I will definitely be uninstalling because it’s not even fun to play anymore . I feel like it’s a waist of time and money . I spent a lot of money on this game and at this point I’m over it,Greedy
3,2023-11-01 20:34:02,This game is so fun. I love it. But I wish it was more of that makes sense. Like I wish players had better chances of winning different cards instead of cards we don’t need. Like if we get #1 in a tournament we should get at least 1 card we don’t already have. I definitely want to see improvements because this game has so much potential !,Fun but…
5,2023-10-17 19:17:44,Ok I don’t even know where to start. This game is so good like when you get on the game it give you so many spins and give you so much money. It’s just so good like this game. I played it for so long and this game has features like like none other games,The perfect game
1,2023-11-01 16:10:36,The level tree tops will not let me complete it i keep building and during my building process it says error the game less restart and continues to go back and it has done at like eight times to me and returned my money but will not let me actually build and complete the board. I’ve been trying for over 30 minutes in my game did update yesterday. Tried to contact support - nothing so far,After level 61 and spooky car win keeps crashing
2,2023-10-29 17:00:23,This game was fun at first; however they have killed the enjoyment with their money hungry greediness.  Increasing the difficulty in finishing challenges while making them less and less rewarding!    Save yourself the disappointment and just skip downloading this game!  You’ll never get the stickers or the pieces to finish challenges anyway.  Play something more fun like FarmVille or candy crush!,The only heisting happening is by the makers of the game
1,2023-10-19 20:08:51,"This game is addictive & fun but I’m so tired of getting the same stickers over & over again. I’m trying to work toward completing them & get 10+ of one sticker. Then when I try to utilize the trading group, they’re making it impossible to trade for them. Then there’s never enough dice. I can’t even move up in events because of the lack of dice. Need more than 20 at a time to be able to do anything. Something needs to change here.","Repeat stickers, never enough dice"
5,2023-09-28 23:48:08,This game is very fun! I connected through Facebook and my friends and I have been getting pretty competitive about it so it’s very enjoyable. The only thing I would change is that there would be another way to earn more dice.,Love it!
3,2023-10-15 13:28:30,The game must be rigged or something cause I’ve spent 500 stars to get the blue safe twice now and haven’t received anything new that I actually need. And then it’s twice as much to save up for a pink safe. All you guys want is money. All we get is one star card packs which does nothing. Trading cards is overrated now cause people are too stingy or asking for money.,Rigged
2,2023-10-13 12:25:13,"I love this game don’t get me wrong but the one thing that really makes me mad is the community chest. I always get ripped off. I’m lucky to get two people picking before it pick a key to get it to open. And the jail I feel like a pay more money to get out then to win dice, and I could go through 100 dice before I landed on anything good. Sometime I feel like this game just dose it to make you spend money. NEWS FLASH NOT EVERYONE HAS MONEY LIKE THAT TO SPEND .",Community chest
1,2023-10-12 13:54:10,Trying to contact customer support when you click on the link it just takes you back to the original article site you were on when you first started I love the game however the last few days there has been technical issues I just completed my board went to go to the next board & the app shut down when I brought it back up I only got my 50 reward dice I did not get my reward money,Customer support
1,2023-10-08 04:03:05,I really enjoyed this game at first and I would say I got addicted but after spending over $1000 on this game I’m realizing more and more that it’s a big scam. They make the game more & more difficult for you to get the cards and ppl who are not even on your friends list is able to attack your board as much as they want while you can only attack them once each time. SCOPELY is extremely greedy at this point and I wish I didn’t download this game in the first place.,THIS GAME IS A SCAM!!!!
2,2023-10-05 03:31:52,"I’ve been playing this game for a month or so now. It’s super fun….when it works. Although, the major downfall to this game is when you have an issue the customer service is a robot chat that never does anything! They have glitches all the time and some people get compensated and some don’t! They need to get it together! They are sitting on a goldmine but will screw it up if they don’t get it together!",Super Glitchy!
1,2023-10-01 18:37:58,This game was fun at first but it becomes very obvious all they want is your money. they hold stickers they know you need until the very end then charge up to 100$ to get them. Then when you do spend the money (which I have) you don’t even get anything new. The game constantly crashes and causes you to lose in the already rigged tournaments. i spent money on rolls and lost it all and the new shields bc of the crash. The games not even fun anymore.,They just want your money
5,2023-09-28 21:28:25,It’s an addicting great game to pass the time I really enjoy playing with friends and trading stickers as well it keeps it interacting and every day there’s a new competition which keeps you on your toes by strategizing and figuring out how to approach each new challenge,Great game.
5,2023-09-28 21:00:56,"I really like the game,and didn’t mind spending money on it. Until something crashed the game just as I was about to get a big reward from a tournament. Now I get to start over. Guess what I’m not going to do “Spend Money”.",Having until!

5,2023-09-28 17:17:06,I absolutely love this game. But I haven’t been able to play at all since this morning. I’ve turned my phone on and off and there isn’t an update for the game. When will this issue be fixed?,Question
3,2023-09-28 18:37:45,I’ve spent over $30 for in purchase add-ons and it keeps closing with errors and it’s causing me to lose my dice my rolls and my rewards that I was working on and should have already gotten. I am hoping that this will be all replaced and fixed so I can collect only what is owed to me I would appreciate it. Thank you so much.,Major connection issues today
5,2023-09-24 09:41:21,The game is fun I can spend hours on it my only gripes are with the hour wait for more dice. Can that timeframe be adjusted. I also would like to see a way to send or share dice. We also need to have more contest with a more time to complete them.,Monopoly Go
4,2023-09-28 15:24:12,"So game has been fun especially with my family but me and my family keep on having issues with crashing, failed launches or even missing rewards. One of my family members lost everything when they got a new phone.",Enjoying but heavy glitches

It was right before I got a perk 150 rolls, I’m hoping for it to load where it left off as I was progressing well. If it does load at the end of the day I will be deleting this app permanently as I’ve tried for the last 4 hours to get it loaded.",Monopoly Go
4,2023-09-28 13:42:56,I have really enjoyed playing monopoly go. The only reason I gave 4 stars is the new update is glitching bad. I’m not able to play for it is constantly telling me there was a problem and needs to restart. Even during the restart it restarts.  Please fix this I really liked the game,Glitches
5,2023-09-12 01:04:20,Game is very fun and challenging. inky downside is you get multiples or the same cards which makes it completely difficult to complete sets! also get multiple gold cards and those cant be traded so they just sit there and do nothing for you!,fun game!
1,2023-09-22 12:38:14,The fact that they allow bots to steal all your money only give 8 dice an hour max. Allow people to shut down your landmarks up to 15 times or more in a row and then only give you duplicate stickers is beyond ridiculous. They want you to go broke playing this game and spend spend spend. It’s no longer fun if you can’t get ahead. They even limiting how much you can use for their special events. And somehow the bad reviews are being deleted.,Game is now trash
4,2023-09-20 22:32:32,"For some some reason I didn’t get 2 of my awards under the Martian Mysteries. When I get new stickers it no longer tells me if I have extras like it used to (+1,+2, etc.) Instead I have to go to the albums to find out. This has been happening since I updated the app yesterday:(",Issue with update
2,2023-09-20 11:59:30,The game was great for the first couple of months after downloading. Now after this new sticker pack it just lost its fun. It’s a lot harder to get dice without making in game purchases which just isn’t always an option for everyone. I’m really sad I have put a lot into the game but it’s too hard to get the gold star stickers and to get enough dice to actually play. The game was ruined with this pack.,Not so fun anymore
1,2023-09-20 07:51:16,"The newest update is garbage, the shield tokens instead up sticker packs at the end of the daily rewards is stupid. The sent sticker screen needs to come back. You changed the blue sticker pack on the wheel so you can barely even land on it. (Use to land on it every 5 spins and haven’t even since the update). The gold stickers are even harder to pull the one you need now also, I have so many duplicates of the same gold and I can get one new one of a 2 star one.",Newest update
1,2023-09-19 15:24:13,"Loved this game at first. Last album was fun even though I spent a RIDICULOUS amount of money. Now I feel like it’s impossible to enjoy the game or move forward without spending money. The sticker packs are a joke. The gold cards in EVERY set are being used to stop us from moving forward even more. I’ll be done after completing my album once, I have no desire to do the all gold pack that comes the second time you do this album.",Getting worse and worse
1,2023-09-17 15:02:49,"This is my second review. This game lures you in and then screws you. I sat directly next to my husband and watched as his game went in the proper order of milestones to complete an event and mine added more things to accomplish. I’ve also been jipped on rewards a couple times and I attempted to message the customer service chat and it’s just a loop of no information, and nobody gets back to you. I’m disappointed and have wasted my time and money.",Inaccurate rewards and impossible milestones
2,2023-09-15 16:35:16,Monopoly on every social media site and on the game itself reviews people are all saying the same thing… they are unhappy with the amount of dice per hour the algorithm of cards dispensed and only receiving 50 dice per completed set. Now the last one maybe to late to do anything about because it would be unfair to previous players but the other two are definitely fixable.,I know you guys see this?
5,2023-09-11 20:39:36,The game keeps freezing even if I turn my phone off and back on it continues staying froze but the times on it will change so like the apps still working just won’t let me touch anything,Malfunctions
5,2023-09-04 23:23:26,I like the game it’s just the fact that it doesn’t want you to get stuff that you need I’ve been trying for an hour just to get a cash grab and used all my 🎲 and still have not got a cash back,I don’t even know
1,2023-09-11 12:40:00,I won a gold card that said new and never received it. Started chat with customer service no response. I purchased package did not receive the package wrote the customer chat not response. The game has been glitching since the start of most recent event. Hit a mega heist the game did not add the multiplier. People that I trade with on a regular basis are randomly deleted as friends. UPDATE they respond to bad reviews but no to still not issue’s reported to customer service smh,They don’t respond to issues
1,2023-09-08 09:00:50,Game is fun and addicting but the dice prices are absolutely over priced. Once you get to a certain level you almost can’t even play the game anymore without spending ridiculous amounts of money for so little dice. If you aren’t a pay to play person who can afford expensive games I highly do not recommend this one. Don’t bother looking for loopholes to get dice because they just patched the one way people were able to have fun on the game.,Total rip off
1,2023-09-08 02:55:29,"As much money as this app is making you made it almost impossible for the average player to finish the new album. And then you release the cooking challenge and cookies aren’t being collected when you land on them. It also shouldn’t be so hard to earn gold cards when every set requires one. And how about don’t give me multiple gold cards when they can’t be traded and if I trade them in, the game is still giving me the same 1 star cards I had!!!!",NEW CARD PACK
5,2023-08-14 04:11:33,"I was seeing this game in ads and was like woah I need to get this game! So I did and so far I do not regret it's super fun and stress-relieving, I like how I can play with my friends and see how they're doing on my board.

1,2023-09-01 03:18:48,"This app was tons of fun in the beginning. But the reward system for the new album feels like nothing but a money grab, followed by a firm slap in the face. I know plenty of people who spent AT LEAST $20, and it’s obvious that the game is making an attempt to capitalize even more on those willing to spend the money. They’d be much better off charging $2.99 for the game as a flat rate, that way they could actually make the game fun, without forcing you to $pend. (7400 net worth)",Horrible new album update
1,2023-09-01 02:32:13,When the new album for stickers came out the dice reward was extremely lower. You don’t get any extra dice for being on higher levels. The game is set up so you spend money on extra dice and extra sticker packs. It was on a good run until they made decisions with the update to make it to where the only way to really enjoy the game is to spend money. 8 dice an hour is a joke and only earn up to 80 dice in 8 hours.,Not enough dice - wants you to spend money
2,2023-08-28 13:36:41,If you have deep pockets you will love this game. If you don’t have money to spend you will find yourself playing your 50 dice a day and not going anywhere within the game.  Basically if you don’t spend a lot of money on this game you will never finish anything.  You’ll be stuck on the same board for a year and never level up.  It’s a fun game that they made impossible to play without spending money.,Great game
1,2023-08-26 17:28:29,It’s fun until you get further into the game and actually want to win things. It gives you multiple Gold stickers that you cannot trade. Check their IG page & you’ll get it. 8 dice every hour gets you nowhere lol. It’s all a scam to take your money for you to still not win. Selling “Guaranteed Sticker” for $100?! Craazzzyyy! The amount of deletes this game will have after this album challenge is done will make them realize they’re wrong.,Pay to Play/Win Find Something Else
1,2023-08-25 22:54:41,"While this game is fun, it is nearly impossible to get the stickers you need without cheating or paying a lot of money. There are too many duplicates given. I have multiple gold card duplicates and they are not trade able. There are multiple Facebook accounts of people complaining or profiting off selling cards and dice links.  I have cut my playing time down significantly. I’ll play my dice up collected over night, close the app and go on about my day.",Game is rigged

3,2023-08-13 23:11:37,Alright we all know its fun! Add a block button for those who are deliberately beating people down. Also in challenges we should be able to remove people who aren’t helping. Gold cards need to be able to be gifted and the sticker packs and chest really shouldn’t be giving the same cards you just got. Fix it or people will go as fast as they came,Fun!
5,2023-08-11 21:09:59,I love this game! I do have an idea that this game should do something with McDonald’s similar to how they use to give out pieces on certain items with a paper board to collect & you would get certain prizes for finishing certain areas on the board. PLEASE make this happen!!!!,McDonald’s Event
5,2023-08-09 21:26:20,I am in the mid 100’s map level. I am sick of getting the same stickers over and over and not being able to get new ones without paying. Close to deleting the game if this issue isn’t resolved.,Sticker selfish

3,2023-08-02 05:43:00,The fact that when you reach a mile stone and win stickers you’re constantly getting the same stickers you already have multiple times.

Can we add a skip animation button so I can play this game quicker and easier or I’ll end up deleting it cause It’s like watching ads everytime I collect something OMGaaaawwwwdddd,The animation is killing me
5,2023-07-22 13:37:33,This game takes Monopoly up several levels! The goals and boards are constantly changing and you get to earn rewards by completing tasks and move up on rank against your “friends”. Love this game! It never gets boring.,Not your basic monopoly game!
5,2023-07-16 15:39:31,Loving this game and the actual ability to play without needing to spend real money to enjoy it. You totally can but you can have just as much fun playing it without doing so. I also love the real ability to play with friends. This game is a win for sure.,Dope game!
5,2023-07-13 17:08:28,Maybe look into a feature where if you don’t want to build/construct you should be able to use the money that we have to buy card packs to help complete sets. Or even vaults that’s prizes come in,Ideas*
2,2023-07-14 15:51:28,I’m not liking that once you play for so long I don’t get anymore NEW CARDS. That is the same reason a lot of us stop playing Coin Master. It doesn’t even matter if I spend money or not I’m still not getting anymore new cards. It’s like you don’t want anyone to win😡😡😡. Can you be fair and fix it. If not I’m going to delete it and find another game to place. It’s starting to get boring because you can’t advance.,Why No New Cards

They just want you to pay more money so they can cheat you. My sister had 3,000+ dice and rolled like 50x and didn’t hit a train station once. If you have money to waste, go for it.

5,2023-07-10 13:02:06,It’s fun but it glitches way to much and shuts down randomly or when your bout to win something it shuts down or restarts and that takes away your prize which isn’t fair cause we work hard for those ….,Please fix

4,2023-07-08 18:57:29,I’ve played this for a few months and really enjoy it. It’s easy to progress and play if you like monopoly. There are a few key issues that I wish would be fixed.   1. Dice refill a small number by the HOUR. This is a long time to wait. The whole Meter should fill in an hour.   2. There aren’t enough opportunities for higher level collection cards. (This is a main way of getting dice) gold cards which aren’t tradeable are repeated.   3. Trading cards should be in app. There are so many cheats and scammers that don’t uphold honest trades and trading over Fb is difficult.,"Great game, but could be better!"
3,2023-07-08 02:17:16,It feel like players should be limited to amount of rolls allowed to be bought in game or players who can’t really buy rolls it should be more in-game things allowing them to gain rolls cause it a fun competitive game but when we laid on shields we should get times the amount of rolls that our multiplier is on at the time because it’s basically giving you nothing,Amount of Rolls

1,2023-06-12 02:13:31,There'sa few games like this one where they want to bet more rolls but the return is less. Way less. Like 1/2 of what you spend. Then they say Get friends. Problem is game is setup to attack your friends first. The algorithm set-up lets you get jus close enough to win but you need to spend $$ 2 finish. Every time. I realize that the developers have to make $$$ but it can still be done in a much more enjoyable way. You should play the game but don’t spend any $$$,"A RIP-OFF, not worth  YOUR $$$"
4,2023-05-23 15:26:45,I like this game but I hate the fact that you only get 5 or 6 dice per hour. I hate that the game promotes joining the club but the club is full of scammers it’s hard to get help. I hate that the game makes it hard to complete sets so you can get extra dice.

I have yet to complete any all the way in three cycles. That is ridiculous. Also they pair you up with people you don’t even know so it’s even harder to complete the side quests at any level higher than 6 or 7. It’s more aggravating than fun to play.,Hard to complete Albums

1,2023-09-22 22:52:58,This game used to be fun. It has cards to collect and with complete sets you are able to earn dice which are necessary to continue playing but now the cards keep being repeated cards. It’s impossible to collect what you need to play. Once you run out of dice you only get 8 dice to roll which means a maximum of 8 turns an hour which gives you nothing.

1,2023-09-20 12:03:07,The game is very fun and addictive but you have to wait 1 hour for 8 dice or you have to buy them. Unless you buy dice you’re not going to win many competition or complete events. You get a free gift every 8 hrs and it maybe 25-30 dice. It needs to be more ways to get more free dice.

4,2023-08-15 20:13:56,The game is great and all but i wish we did not have to wait an hour for 8 dice. Maybe we can wait 30 minutes to get 8 dice. I wish when we level up a board we get more than 50 dice. Also i wish when we get the purple pack we get stickers we need not copies of the same stickers.,The Game is FUN
2,2023-08-15 14:41:24,The cake contest had its issues with crashing the game but I really enjoyed it. I’m not sure what happened with the car show. It seemed like the wheel was rigged to give you low numbers. I really hope this isn’t turning into a game you can’t complete without paying for it. Because I worked hard and didn’t complete a single car. If the next one is the same I just won’t participate.,Car show
2,2023-08-08 21:33:05,I think it’s a scam EveryTime you finish building a board they give you 50 dice which isn’t anything in this game it takes hundreds of millions and hundreds of dice to get the hundreds of millions to past the board then they give u 12million and 50 dice lol they want you to spend spend spend spend and the stickers you get the same stickers over and over and over and over and over again it’s a BIG SCAM,It’s a Scam

I’ve had 3 GOLD CARDS away from wining the entire thing and I haven’t gotten a new card after spending money and playing countless of hours. I don’t understand ..

4,2023-07-27 20:38:46,"I love this game. It is super fun and keeps me engaged for hours. I gave it 4 stars only because I wish we could share dice with friends, like we can stickers.

4,2023-07-24 17:49:07,"Enjoying the game but the number of duplicate cards you get is insane. Even if you purchase one of the deals, there's no guarantee you'll get the card you need. It would also be helpful if the 5 star and gold cards could be traded. Other than that, I enjoy playing",Too many duplicates
4,2023-07-24 14:36:12,I’ve enjoyed the separate mini game rewards we get for landing on certain spaces. I wish there was a way to track the one on top to see how close we are to the end. As well wish the gold stickers were trade able I have all the cards now just missing the gold and I’m stuck in limbo,Fun game
5,2023-07-18 14:14:34,"The game allows you to play for a long time without the threat of having to keep buying rolls to spin. I wouldn’t mind seeing it open to play with random others in a game.

3,2023-07-05 20:16:10,This game is great. I like it and I enjoy having fun with friends but lately the app been closing and keeps saying no internet connection when I have internet connection.  Every time I’m in the middle of my dice the game shuts down claiming error. Also because of that I lost 350 of my macaroons that I had and had to complete a board over again. Fix it!,Problems
4,2023-07-05 19:40:23,This game was fun until they did the update and it stopped working properly.

4,2023-07-04 08:01:52,Like the game but feel we should be able to trade more cards then just the 5.  When there are fb pages and people needing cards it leads to some frustrated people who then remove the game. So maybe make the change to allow more card exchanges.   Other then that it’s a good game,Game change needed

It is next to impossible to get all of the stickers to get the “free” large reward. I like the game, but there are issues that need to be fixed.",What’s the Point?

It’s rigged big time. I’ve eneded up jailed 5 times in a row. When you want to land somewhere, it’ll totally avoid those. I know scopley. They are app scammers. Play it, but don’t invest your money.

But, there are a few things you could change for instance like ads, payment, and other things, but really what I hate the most is it get SO BORING like I’m not joking if you want to download I don’t care if you do just be aware that it definitely gets SUPER BORING after a  while.",I don’t know if it’s good or bad
3,2023-05-29 17:06:28,"Been playing for a while. It’s a good time waster. But some things I’d improve:  1) the animations take too long and are too frequent. Anytime you claim a reward it takes a while and you have to sit though the animation. Unnecessary. This is the most annoying part of the game.   2) pop ups. You launch the game and you have at least 4 pop ups, not adds but offers snd events. It’s annoying.   3) the “showdowns” are stupid. Like it’s supposed to give it a multiplayer element but it’s asinine.   4) it’s pretty repetitive, not much nuance to the game.   Bug: there is a bug where it says “higher multiplier available” but it’s not always the case.",Fun but could be better.
4,2023-05-08 06:21:32,It’s super fun to play and I could play it for hours lol. I also enjoy trading stickers. The only things I would complain about is the amount of dice you get is very limited (only 6 per hour) AND you can only trade stickers 5 times a day.

I have been collecting stickers since the new round started and at the beginning you would get new stickers and now the past two weeks no new stickers no matter how many packs you win or buy to open and you never get new tokens for the new xtra rewards in the vaults.

3,2023-08-31 05:11:54,"Multiple times my game had glitches and I loss dice, money, points, etc and it’s highly annoying cause I’ve been trying to win the sticker game.. well tonight someone sent me a sticker and I never received the sticker… how can I contact or fix my issues.. the link it sends me to never gives me a option to speak to anyone..",Good game but glitches
1,2023-08-30 15:13:46,This game is rigged! I only need 2 gold stickers to complete my album and it’s impossible! You can’t trade the gold stickers. I keep getting duplicates of the same ones. They want you to spend money to have a chance of completing  albums. Customer service is a joke. They don’t help. I got scammed and lost a sticker in the group they suggested to trade in. You only get 50 dice when completing a board. The rewards are getting harder to complete. I’m just about over this game.,Rigged game
5,2023-08-04 06:05:15,"my gf sent me a inv and and i got the game and ive been blocked, ignored, and yelled at all bc of my rolls and bank heist 😭😭 shes to addicted she got the cane at like 9:30 and she level 173 with her only limitations being her running out of rolls and her card bein locked thats is actually so funny i love this game😂😂",This is to addicting😭😭
1,2023-08-24 15:29:11,"I wrote a review about how rigged this game in favor of those who spend money - i found this out by being unemployed, so i don't spend money on the game but do spend a lot of time. my partner spent $20 one time, and within a month he had massively overtaken my progress - even though i play more often, and began playing a month before he did.  that review was deleted. so now i ALSO know that the only reason this game has 4.9 stars is bc they have honest reviews removed.",Rigged to punish F2P
3,2023-08-23 23:33:27,So I bought some dice and when I went back into the game some of my dice where gone and I went to open a card and once it open the card I needed disappear after the game kicked me out like I was almost done with my album and now I gotta keep playing to get that card back,This game is addictive but I been having some problems
2,2023-08-13 20:55:39,Although when the game first started it was fun. But now not so much. The game makes it hard to finish task. Compared to most games it doesn’t take an whole hr to replenish dice. On the other  hand yours do. The sticker trading is a complete joke. It doesn’t refresh  stickers for weeks at a time. You should take the gold cards away and make them tradable. The game has also become boring and not fun to play anymore,A Complete Joke
5,2023-08-01 13:21:56,"Really enjoying this game so far! I love how you get to interact with real people. Some are your friends and some are strangers. As far as I know there are no ads, which is great, and they give you multiple ways to earn dice rolls. It is definitely my new guilty pleasure!",So nostalgic!!
5,2023-07-26 13:46:14,"This game completely revamped my love for monopoly, it completely revolutionized the game, no lie I was skeptical at first because of how slow monopoly usually is but I fell in love instantly, I don’t even think I’ve watched one ad like every other game.   10/10 Definitely recommend",BEST VERSION OF MONOPOLY BY FAR
3,2023-08-01 04:57:42,"So the game is fun and easy to play.  Several things need changed. A. The amount of duplicate stickers you get is RIDICULOUS. Once the set is complete, you shouldn’t receive any more of those cards. Please pass out the cards y’all know we need! B. Rolling doubles, you should get the free roll to follow, just like in the original game. Not extra money. The money is easy to come by.","Fun game, but…"
5,2023-07-23 14:35:21,"This game is literally so FUN! I can go for hours playing this, and not get bored! The only thing I don’t really like is that it’s not really a pay to win game, but something like that. Another thing is the dice, but you can open gifts and buy properties to get more. Overall, WONDERFUL game!",AMAZING GAME
5,2023-07-18 02:32:08,It’s a fun game to play there is nothing wrong with this game it lets you steal people money which is fake and it left u knock down the houses so you can have lots lots of money I’ve been only playing for 2 days and I’m on a high level this game is the best game that I have…..,It’s fun
3,2023-07-23 06:31:03,Absolutely love the game can’t stay off of it at work playing cooking playing just all around better then any other game I was playing only down fall is you can’t get no good cards that you need but seem to get dups of every other card you already have only if I can use my dice to buy the cards I need every set would be done .,Monopoly
4,2023-07-21 13:28:51,I really like playing this game but today it wouldn’t load I’m assuming they were preparing for update but in the process when it did load I upgraded three properties and then it kicked me out and when I got back and I had to re-upgrade those properties… took my dice and my money,Frustrated
5,2023-07-16 00:58:28,"I love this game, it’s the first game I have played that honestly, I don’t get frustrated with for various ads, pay more money to play, etc. if you are looking for a game for a serotonin fix on your work break or after work this is the game for you.",Fantastic
5,2023-07-15 01:48:20,I just moved out from my home and me and my family we used to play monopoly ALL the time now thanks to this can we can also play it together even if we are not near each other. 👍,Great long distance family game
5,2023-07-06 20:39:36,"I am a huge fan of this game. However, since the update I cannot click the start button on my community chest.  It’s stuck.  I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling the app with no luck. Pleeeaase fix it.  I’m getting robbed and shut down. Lol",Malfunctioning
2,2023-07-12 06:50:04,Super fun game however you have so many ads that pop up convincing you to buy buy buy and at the the value isn’t even good! $5 for 70 rolls that’s wild! If there was a way to calm the ads down and play where so many don’t pop ip every time you get low on rolls or out that would be amazing or maybe have a section where you can just click the ads like in the shop!,Way to many ads
1,2023-07-07 11:13:49,"this game is supper fun! and very addictive! the issue is for three days i’ve been stuck in a constant shutdown loop. and it seems like the technical team doesn’t know how to fix it. i’m not the only one either, they also released false information saying that its fixed when’s it’s not! i’m officially done waiting for the game to get its stuff together and i’m getting rid of it because i’m not about to wait for an issue that seems like it can’t be fixed.",Bugs
5,2023-07-06 12:39:56,Everytime I open the app it automatically opens community chest. But doesn’t let me press start. It’s been 4 days . If it doesn’t work in another day or to I’ll permanently delete it. I’ve even redownloaded it still same issue!!,Problem
5,2023-07-06 00:27:21,"The app keeps either crashing in the middle of my game and reloads and then other times when I’m doing a fresh start up, it gets stuck at 30% load and then keeps restarting",Crashes and keeps reloading
5,2023-07-05 16:07:23,Game keeps crashing when trying to load and whenever you win big!! And then it’s not giving you what you won but still taking the rolls and money used!!,Game keeps crashing and taking what I win!!!
4,2023-07-05 23:27:58,Please fix the bug when loading up. It was working fine before the bake off thing. It’s nice and something different but I’m constantly having issues to restart or stuck at 30% while trying to load. Thank you,Recent update
5,2023-06-09 04:37:04,Now most games get boring and you’re not really doing to much. BUT THIS GAME RIGHT HEREEEEEEE has me in a choke holddd and i love it. You get to rob ppl shut down the buildings and build your own stuff. And lets not forget the prizes like you can’t loseee with a game like this and THERES NO ADDSSSSS who yk got no adds I’ll waitt………………..,Better than subway surfers
1,2023-06-23 21:51:31,"This game is for people who have a bunch of money to throw at games. I don’t mind spending a few bucks here and there but in order to play this game you’ll be spending AT LEAST a few bucks EVERY DAY. You get under 100 free rolls a day but at higher levels you’re expecting to roll 10 dice at a time, which equates to 10 rolls a day. If you want to roll more you will need to either pay or win an event. (Winning events also costs rolls, so by proxy winning events ALSO costs money)",PAY TO WIN
5,2023-05-23 17:52:49,This game is 10/10!!! The fact you don’t get ads every 3 mins or have to watch ads just to play makes me soo happy. You can play this game without paying too and progress without spending a dime. This is how game apps should be !!,No ads!!!
4,2023-06-03 16:12:08,"I thought this game was a lot of fun for the first two hours. Then reality kicked in, 1 hour to get 5 rolls or pay. Numerous ads to pay for rolls or money. Its based not on the game but actually stealing money and destroying other’s property. It’s just a pretty way for the developers to advantage of impatient people and their money.",Over the top money grab
5,2023-05-20 19:15:54,"This game is very compelling and addictive, the only thing I would change is the amount of rolls people get. Instead of 40 it should cap off at 70 at least. So we can use more multipliers for people who don’t wanna spend a lot of money on the game to progress.",awesome game!!
5,2023-05-03 18:57:00,I honestly am enjoying monopoly go so much! You can make money easy and build all the stuff you need to move on to the next board. My favorite part is bank heist when you land on the rail road. And you don’t get money if you land on free parking.,Having so much fun
5,2023-11-06 11:15:28,When you get a chance card it Durant give you your full valve Example  You received 1.5 m for walking dogs  Your card can give the multiplier at the specified amount but doesn’t go to the bank,Glitch
2,2023-05-01 00:19:29,"Game is fun but is waaaay too slow, waiting a whole hour for more rolls. Also, I have invited 10 friends and am unable to collect rewards for doing so. I have contacted support multiple times but no response. Only time I get a solid amount of play time (which is probably only about 15 minutes) is through inviting friends and there's only so many friends I can invite.",please FIX the invite friends rewards
5,2023-11-01 16:31:56,"I very much enjoy the game, first game I’ve enjoyed for awhile. Today, it has closed out unexpectedly..like 50 times. Its been pretty frustrating to say the least, nothing i do, saves so i have to keep updating the same land marks.",Glitching
1,2023-11-01 20:01:34,"So we just had a car building tournament which was great at first. Today most of the old challenges ended and the new ones did not give us any wheels for meeting milestones. I found that very unorganized being that they challenges did not end at the same time as the car event, and we did not gain anything to help us from the new ones. Me and my partner would have finished it they gave us wheels for completing milestones on the new challenges… but no.",Car building 11/1

I cannot buy property or roll without the app crashing and then it reverts back to where I started out prior to buying property, collecting rent or rolls, etc. it’s like I move the needle forward just a bit to only be brought back. This needs to be fixed. I can’t play more than 10 sec before it crashes.",App Crashing
3,2023-10-31 02:49:50,"I used to love playing this game. But now the fact that it’s SO hard to get the stickers you need is so annoying/frustrating. Makes you not want to play anymore because all you get are repeated stickers. Also, the partner challenges have become almost impossible to win. It’s just not fun to play anymore.",Not fun anymore
1,2023-10-29 04:05:51,This game was a blast but for the last 3 months they have managed to destroy a once. Rey du. Game to play. This last partner event they have made impossible to finish without spending ALLOT of money raising to points to finish each car and rigging it to where you never land on anything has taken the joy out of it. You raisded the point total from the last event by at least 20 thousand points and gave us no way to earn parts to build without spending money.,Money hungry
5,2023-10-15 14:06:53,It is a really fun game and sometimes too much fun You can really spend a lot of time playing when you finally build up enough dice rolls which can take awhile but once you do it becomes real addictive.,Monopolizing
3,2023-10-26 18:44:34,This game used to be great before it got all the attention it’s getting now. I feel like the creators are now money hungry and being super stingy with stickers. In the last three weeks I’ve only gotten new stickers when swapping out old stickers for vaults and even then they weren’t good. I’ve rolled over 6.5k dice and nothing good. I have deleted the app.,Used to be great
4,2023-10-24 13:08:34,"Love the game but the stickers system is really unfair. I’m getting multiples of the same stickers, never able to complete the other sticker packs.

2,2023-10-21 14:41:08,"The game play is good.   The graphics are awesome, but the customer service is horrible.  They cut you off halfway through an inquiry, they make you wait 24 hours on most problems, and they don’t really seem to care.  They made the albums harder to finish requiring you to spend more money.  And the new features they have added are totally missing the mark.",A good game but major flaws
5,2023-10-15 02:07:22,I have always loved Monopoly.  Now there is a way for me to play with just myself in the room.  I also don’t have to bribe a sister or cousin to play and keep playing until it’s over.  Sore losers is what those kids were;),Monopoly is still fun:)
5,2023-10-10 16:17:37,I have been playing this game for a while but in the reviews it says it has sexual adds wich I have not seen one so if you’re wondering about your kids or yourself do try this came family friendly,Great game
1,2023-10-14 01:11:47,"I really like this game, but it’s impossible to get to the next levels or obtain all the rewards without spending hundreds of dollars every day..  Game is full of bots making it important to win the events, and all the hackers that cheat and steal all of your money.

1,2023-10-11 17:31:09,"the only reason that some people are doing really well is because they spend real money on the game like losers who have no life. for people who actually try really hard who actually have jobs and a place in this world, the game literally gives us next to nothing to help us. they need to give us way more done in order for us to actually be able to compete or do anything actually useful. the need to give us better luck and not screw us over all the time. and make it so that you can’t spend real money in the game, because it’s honestly ridiculous that so many people, who somehow have jobs that make so much money just to spend on stupid mobile games, do so well. they make it way less fun to play.",this game is annoying
5,2023-09-29 14:25:55,This is the best game ever!! What makes it more fun is that you can play with your family and friends even though you’re miles apart :) A chat would be nice though. Maybe that can be the next update lol Way to go on this invention!!,Love this!!
3,2023-10-08 10:39:29,"I really do enjoy playing the game, I just hate that i have more duplicate gold stickers than I have album’s completed.

4,2023-10-02 18:05:41,I absolutely love the game. I wish there were more ways to get dice. I also wish we were able to get the 4 and 5 star stickers we need to complete our sets. I play with several friends and family members and we are all missing the same stickers.,More Stickers and Dice

The level three star chest went from 1500 (already too high) stars for hardly ANY dice and packs, to 2500, INSANE. for also, even LESS DICE and hardly any good stickers. It’s such a waste of time. Not worth playing anymore. Delete this game before you realize you wasted all your time too. They will never fix it.

3,2023-09-23 00:57:42,"I grew up playing the Monopoly board game and was excited that there is one for technology. I downloaded the Monopoly Go game and discovered that it is not made for iPads. By that I mean that I have to turn my iPad sideways - which is very inconvenient - in order to play the game. To be fair, there are other apps that I have tried and deleted for the same reason.",Not made for an iPad
5,2023-09-18 01:54:03,Wish there were less pop ups. Have to click through 4-5 pop ups for buying bundles before you get to play. And it happens frequently. But other than that. Super addicting game.,Great game but
3,2023-09-12 03:43:06,I like the game but waiting an hour for 8 dice is ridiculous. We also don’t get good cards. I think it’s a rip off in the aspect. Even when you buy a deck you still get duplicates of cards you already have. Also the safes. Give us good cards in the safe. If the higher we get on board requires more money to be spent give us more dice.,Needs work.

1,2023-09-10 10:37:55,This games doesn’t follow statistics probability at all. You will spend 1000 dices (5x multiplier) and land on all other places than the one that should get reward. Before SEP23 it was good and generous. Now they turned switch to make you a cash cow. And paying doesn’t remove the rigged probability. No one will refund you for the bug or intentional rigging. Also another glitch - after animation I lost 1000 dices. Customer support said wait 24 hours and later no reply.,Recently rigged and glitched
5,2023-08-12 16:40:36,This game is so fun you can you can move to different countries in the game and you get money that means you can like build things and you can earn dice to roll and I just really think you should get it so get it if you can,Get this game it’s so fun

Right now, this is confined to Monopoly Go UK, but once other groups see this, it will spread.   SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS!

1,2023-08-13 20:33:55,I’ve NEVER written a review for a game but I am highly annoyed with all the duplicate stickers I’ve gotten the same exact Gold card 3 times and it can’t even be traded this just seems dishonest on the game creators end EVERY SINGLE Sticker pack I’ve gotten has the same duplicates even the ones I’ve purchased NOT ONE was a new card come on now not even 1 new card ??? I’m probably going to delete the game today because it’s getting ridiculous!,The Duplicate Stickers are ridiculous
4,2023-08-11 06:06:55,I love monopoly go don’t get me wrong I’m on it all the time how ever every way or video to show how to add friends it says there is 3 options to add friends on my end there is only 2 options so I have friends that play that I can’t add can y’all please fix this so I can play with my friends and destroy them,Friends
4,2023-08-10 20:13:10,I downloaded this game thinking it was like monopoly but it’s nothing like it I’ve been addicted for weeks btw I’m not a bot and I don’t here I’m 11 one flaw is that it has ads sometimes and it has a feature where every hour you get five rolls which makes it boring,Not what I was expecting
4,2023-08-06 18:02:32,I like the game. It would be nice if it were more interactive such as a chat feature or better games. I hate the cash grab one. It’s weird bc I have a protector on my iPhone. I like Peg E but that’s about it. Some of the other games are unrealistic. It also gets repetitive. Maybe more ways to keep adults active on it v,I like it
3,2023-08-09 15:33:39,"I really love this game!! It’s so entertaining!! I love monopoly boards, but my friends think it’s such a long game and never want to play… So this is a way for me to play by myself whenever i want without my friends saying that’s it’s to boring or something else. The only thing that annoys me is that you have to pay for some stuff. Like why? Can’t we just have fun for free?",Monopoly Go
4,2023-08-05 05:37:29,"The game is super fun and takes a spin on the classic, but I feel as though the board could be more interactive. The characters are so adorable but if they had more than maybe two or three moves it would be more aesthetically pleasing.",I wish the characters were more interactive!
1,2023-08-05 22:39:37,"Oh, jolly disappointing game, Monopoly Go. A right confusing mess, I must say. The new mechanics and fiddly bits are quite off-putting. Takes the charm right out of the classic Monopoly, it does. The artwork's a tad too flashy for my liking, and the learning curve is terribly steep, which made it dreadfully tiresome to play. Those blasted special cards, they ruined the fun with their random nonsense! I shan't play this game again, it's simply not worth the effort, old chap. Stick to the original Monopoly, far more enjoyable, if you ask me.",Terrible
5,2023-07-11 17:31:01,This game is simple and easy to play. I’m not one for micro transactions so when I run out of dice I just wait. But even if I were the pricing is not bad for the amount of dice you get to keep going. There is always extra chances to get free dice to roll which I love.,Satisfying
3,2023-08-03 21:33:26,"I’ve been playing this game for about longer than 45 days straight. I haven’t gotten a new sticker in so long. If I don’t get this lion token, I’m gonna have to be done with this game, playing multiple times throughout the day every day why I have I gotten any more new stickers. It’s been at least 10 or12 days since I got a new",40 days straight playing
3,2023-08-02 14:50:50,"I would rate it higher but it just has a few things that annoy me. For example, all the pop ups trying to make you buy stuff gets annoying after a while. Plus it leaves a notification on the app even after i open and close it several times. I hate that. But the game itself is fun.",Decent
3,2023-07-28 13:46:25,The game is cool but unless you spend money you will not get the needed stickers to complete a set. I may be done with this game cause I have been waiting on stickers for weeks. Don’t get me started on the wait for dice to replenish….. 1 hour for 6 dice. How is it you go to bed and it’s been 7 hours and you only have 40 dice????? That math did not math at all!!!!!,Fix the sticker issue
3,2023-07-24 20:46:10,"1.It won’t let me play PEG-E it just freezes up and I have to close out the game and open it back up!  2. Most of the time it won’t open up and it says “Error you are not connected to the internet please connect and try again.” When I am connected to the internet  3.People SCAM you on many groups on apps like Discord, Facebook, and Instagram!",It’s good but…
1,2023-07-21 09:05:25,This game is rigged the events are filled with bots that will smoke you once you get to the higher levels. Also once you get to the higher levels you can hit 20 railroads and only 1 will be a bank robbery and that 1 bank robbery you won’t be able to get bank robbery or mega heist game is a scam I wouldn’t recommend wasting your time. Oh also you’ll never complete the sticker pack the game won’t let you so you might as well waste your time with another game,This game is rigged
3,2023-07-17 13:08:29,"I wasn’t feeling the thought of the game, but after a while I gave it a try. At first it was okay and helped pass the time, now I’m over it. I had over 1000 rolls to use, I closed the game for 10 minutes and when I got back on they were gone. I’m like wait, huh, what in the heck?! Needless to say there are other glitches too but you’ll see.",Well
5,2023-07-06 20:12:57,I’m a little disappointed because the new update must still have a few bugs in it because all of my events /bars disappeared. I was trying to collect my 650 dice and Easter eggs and poof all my progress is gone!,I’m really enjoying the game.
1,2023-07-11 05:37:53,"With the latest update, my game is stuck in a loop (going on 6 days now). I’ve submitted tickets, provided screenshots with tons of feedback and not heard a peep from customer support. It’s a fun game as long as the developers don’t scare something up and mess up your game to where you can’t even play it anymore. I even bought a few things and am now out those items. Worst customer support ever.   I’ll update if they ever fix this and respond to my tickets.",No customer support

5,2023-06-26 01:27:42,Before this game I never liked monopoly but when some people put me on to this I loved it I felt like it was teaching people some real life stuff and it was also fun to take peoples money and break down some stuff especially the heist Keep up the good work👍,Monopoly lover
2,2023-06-30 19:01:22,"This game was fun and super addictive for about an hour, when the rolls of the dice ran out. You literally get 5 rolls of the dice per hour (granted u CAN win rolls but once you get to Venice, that hardly ever happens) otherwise if you want to keep playing you have to spend REAL money for more rolls. Definitely not worth the space it's taking up on my phone. Fun while it lasted, but, I will be deleting this app.","Don't download, they want your money!!!"
4,2023-06-28 03:34:50,This game is very good and very enjoyable but the sending card limit only being 5 kind of ruins the game. I always play with my friends and we can’t send each other cards because of the limit! So I would recommend changing it to like 10.,Sending cards limit 5
5,2023-04-25 16:28:00,I invited friends they downloaded through the link I sent I was not credited for none of them… I hope that gets fixed but love the game we have fun playing each other… I just wish we was credited for adding people…,No credits but fun game
2,2023-06-25 05:11:32,Super fun game but I feel like some stickers are already really hard to get but if I’m putting REAL money into certain purchases that include sticker packs I should get new ones…. Even a purple or blue pack has a small chance of getting a new sticker sometimes it’s not fair. People are fighting in groups over these stickers and its taking the fun out of the game. Mamma Mammoth and Pet Pegasus are so heavily fought over it’s ridiculous.,Super fun but a little unreasonable
3,2023-06-18 02:15:31,"The game is fun at first. Roll dice and move around the board. Unlock new boards and complete challenges on the leader board to win extra five and become number one. However after a couple of day you start to lose all the time and can never get ahead as your piece never lands on the right spot, not like it did at first. You can buy rolls and keep playing but you will still be more unlucky the longer you play.   And the very worst feature of the game is the dang pop ups when you run out of rolls. Go figure it’s just like the other dice rolling games.   But great game for a couple of days!  Not worth to spend money on.",Good for a couple of days
1,2023-06-13 16:26:36,This game could be so much better. You have to wait an hour just for the dice to regenerate too many pop ups to buy something. If i wanted to buy it the first time i would of bought it instead of clicking the “X”. When you run out of dice it shows about 3 or more pop ups just til you get back to the board. You are already advertising the thing on the side of the screen why must u advertise it EVERY SINGLE TIME you run put of dice. Just makes no sense to me.,Listen
3,2023-06-10 04:02:24,"It started off fun but too many purchase options in your face and not many ways to get free stuff. If you aren’t willing to spend a fortune, you aren’t winning any timed games. Additionally, the game gets progressively harder as you go farther but the options for more rewards doesn’t increase to counteract the increase in difficulty.",Gets old real quick
2,2023-06-07 02:41:59,"Overall good game, just needs some minor tweaks! I love going from place to place and upgrading buildings on the way. The building cost and upgrading progress is great. I like the roll multiplier and being able to choose to use it or not. The most annoying part is getting prompted EVERY TIME to PAY for more rolls and having to wait 55 minutes for 5 rolls:/ deleted the game because of the annoyance.",Needs some dumming down!
5,2023-04-25 10:23:17,I could spend weeks on end playing this game and have fun with friends too!!! It’s also funny when I see them go bankrupt after raiding them 😂😂🤷🏻‍♀️ If your looking to get revenge from the board game or from playing on console this is the game for you 😝😝😝,So ADDICTIVE!!!
5,2023-11-09 23:32:48,The game definitely could give more dice an hour and easier to finish sets once you only need your golden stickers to finish been stuck on 3 different sets because they all need one golden sticker and nobody’s willing to trade,I love the game
1,2023-11-11 16:55:37,"Another Glitch. Opened the community chest with all 9 friends today. I did not get the 5 star card or the billion dollars earned and the rolls are stuck on 1 I can not raise it to 2,3,5 or 10. I have noticed I didn’t get the earned prize before but this game is getting ridiculous with giving out earned prizes.

I hardly ever get rolls or new cards and I’m over 3,000 in the game. You get the same stickers over and over that it’s near impossible to reach your goal without spending any money.

1,2023-10-08 17:37:20,My daughter talked me into downloading this. So the whole family started playing. At first it was fun but now I am over it. People cheat and use hacks to get tons of free dice and you can’t complete your stickers or win tournaments. The game has started to have a ton of glitches and the creators don’t fix it and you end up losing rewards and not completing builds. So you just end up frustrated.

5,2023-09-12 01:15:08,I absolutely love this game. What a flash back from growing up. The best part is you can get doubles three times in here and not go to jail for it. If you haven’t tried it have been thinking about it just download it and trust me then you’ll be addicted.,Fun

If I offer a sticker for another sticker let me put it up for trade in the app.  Once someone accepts the trade the app/game ensures that both players get the stickers that we agree to trade for.    Also, it should not take 1500 freaking stars to open a purple chest!!!! If I’m willing to trade 3 gold 5 star stickers I should be able to get a different 5 star in return.

And since it takes more dice to continue playing to get more shields, you either have to allow your properties to be destroyed or pay for more dice.

2,2023-09-18 22:47:28,"When i first open the game there is to many pop ups i'd say like 5-6 pop ups wanting me to buy things for the game i DO NOT WANT TO BUY , it's annoying having to click x and x over 5 times and knowing it's so slow it takes a minute to even get to the game itself, and the animations for bank heist , shut downs and even collecting rent is just so slow .",To many pop ups and slow animations
2,2023-09-17 02:32:14,"I love this game and would love to play it more but can legit only play once a day because I have to wait a hour just for 5-8 spins which is kinda loco. I would love if they had a option to gift friend things other then just stickers, I would like to be able to enjoy the game instead of getting sad when I’ve only been playing 5 mins and I’m already out of spins.",Too long for spins.
1,2023-09-15 14:41:13,If I could give zero stars I would! I see so many bad reviews lately THEN I  five stars thrown in there..I’m sure it’s bots trying to keep the reviews high star..ANYWAYS I get an email yesterday around 3:15 (I do get notifications on emails) and said I didn’t respond quick so it is a closed matter!! Come on..I opened it with in a minute. I CANT CONNECT DISCONNECT FROM A FB OR APPLE!! I want to reconnect to gaming FB..simple fix!! I have done EVERYTHING that has been mentioned to no avail..FIX!! PLEASE.,Customer service is a laugh
3,2023-09-11 11:17:45,"The game is fun to pass time, but the pop up ads within the game trying to get you to pay for dice is overbearing. As soon as you have run out of dice the game spams you with sometimes 5-6 different pop ups wanting you to spend money for more.  I get it, the game wants to profit but to me it’s overbearing.",The pop up prompts to spend money are ridiculous
4,2023-09-10 13:38:41,"This game is super fun and easy. It’s not really like the real monopoly, but still very fun. One thing I would like to change about it is the community chest. Every time you land on it is adds money to it and you have to do something to get it. I love this game, it’s super fun having to compete against other people.",Super fun
2,2023-09-10 03:23:52,"- It’s algorithm needs serious tuning. Every time there’s an event, you will rarely land on whatever the designated tile is. - Can’t message partners in the app - There’s events that require teamwork to complete. If your partner does nothing, you’re stuck with them. They have huge prizes and you lose out. It’s aggravating you can’t switch partners.  Love this game, but it makes me angry at the same time. I guess it is like the board game!",Love/Hate
1,2023-09-08 17:15:57,"I was loving the game when I first started playing. Then there was an issue were people weren’t getting stickers to complete boards. Now on the epic myths, your getting stickers, but not the dice like it was before. Your getting less dice to complete albums, the prizes boxes when you play to tournaments, you receive less dice. I understand it’s just a game, but it’s a rigged game so that you don’t have a choice but to purchase dice. Developers need to solve that problem!!!",Rigged!!!
4,2023-09-07 23:21:41,"I’m definitely into this game and have spent more money on this than I ever have in a game ap. But please PLEASE fix the issues. It’s pretty discouraging to have expectations of prizes and stickers, and so on, only for the count to be off or other glitches. I look forward to the updates!",Please fix
5,2023-08-24 16:23:33,"At first I loved the game. But then I wanted to bump that top meter thing over to win the 900 dice… lol they never gave them to me. Start counting your moves and such and you’ll see. I still play the game because it is fun, but I’ll never buy anything ever again.",This game
3,2023-08-30 09:22:23,"First off you made a over long “review” bashing someone else opinion on the game, which shows how childish you really are. Second.. the game need to up the rewards as we move up the board it’s no way I’m on board 87 and still have to wait a whole hour for 7 dice it’s ridiculous. We shouldn’t have to spend outrageous amounts of money on a GAME!",Upnover30
2,2023-08-27 06:58:54,"This game was really fun for a few weeks but then it started to get boring. Also, another thing I learned about this game is they be lying. First, they don’t give us all the money and dices we earned, i did the math. Another reason is I was watching my sister play and she knocked someone’s property down and when I knocked the same person’s property it’s a whole different place, but overall this is a fun game.",An okay game
2,2023-08-26 20:58:16,"In the beginning this game was fun and addictive. But trying to get these stickers is impossible. There should be a trading option and a gifting option. People have been been scammed with trading. I know the game isn’t supposed to be super easy, but come on. There’s about 4 days left and I keep getting 1 star stickers. It’s like the only people competing there landmarks and these stickers are the people spending money.",Uugghh
3,2023-08-26 17:02:29,"I LOVE this game. Super fun to play. However. I ended up running out of dice. Tried to buy more, MULTIPLE times with it saying there was a payment error. Couldn’t be completed. So I tried but it never worked right? Ended up taking $30+ out of my account without even realizing it and never got ANY dice. I have contacted support. Hopefully I get my refund…",Very addicting…but
2,2023-08-26 16:28:39,"This game is maybe the most boring phone game I’ve ever played. There is no strategy or thinking, it’s just watching your little guy hop around the board. Every once in awhile you click something. There’s no way to speed it up, and since it requires the occasional click you have to keep watching. Two stars because there aren’t ads, but wow is it boring.",Exceptionally boring
5,2023-08-19 21:02:35,The game is fun but I think as the levels go up after building the dice should go up with each level of building because the building cost is more for each level 50 dice isn’t enough,Monopoly
3,2023-08-22 13:16:01,I spend money to buy dice to make sure I can get my stickers literally at the last sec the game will not give u any railroads I went through 600 diced only spent 10 dice at a time I’m down to 18 dice where I can only do 3x the dice and still haven’t touched one railroad the game wants you to keep spending all your money with no reward download at your own risk,Game is rigged
5,2023-08-18 21:10:17,I really enjoy this game I wish that y’all pls think about putting it on a gaming console it would go viral I love the fact that you can take people money and brake down there stuff it’s amazing this is a new way of playing monopoly and people love it !!,Monopoly
5,2023-08-17 02:47:31,"Love Monopoly, this is an interesting twist and it’s competitive to play with many of your friends and it never ends but you can stop whenever you want as well. The longer you’re away, the more friends will take all that you have. Lol it’s fun",Dope
4,2023-08-17 12:56:11,Game is fun but the glitches are annoying. Need more events that you can pair up with friends for. The car game was fun but super hard to get wheels. The dice amount per hour could be increased or lessen the time to 30 minutes. Need more chances of getting 5 star & gold cards.,Fun Game but needs improvement
5,2023-08-15 11:59:36,I love playing the game forsure but when i was rolling  and i did a heist i got the highest one and once i the event ended it didnt give me my dice i was suppose to get for getting the second present it was like 200 or something like that in dice,I like the game but my game said error
5,2023-08-04 14:05:18,It’s a very fun and addicting game and I only got it yesterday. The one thing I would want to change is the amount of dice roles you have given to you each day. I wish something like 100. But than that it is truly my favorite game!!,An amazing game 👍🏼
3,2023-08-10 12:38:37,"I give it 3 stars not because the game is bad, the game is super fun and addicted . However my family, friends, and myself are always buying packages to get more dice and stickers and they keep giving the same exact stickers everyday. With how much we play on a consistent basis you would think we should be getting new stickers .",Same stickers
4,2023-08-07 18:35:25,I absolutely love Monopoly and love to collect the game. So downloading this game was a no brainer for me. I will say after spending a couple days on it the one thing I absolutely hate about the app is just how much it lags. There have been multiple times I have to shut the game down and then get back on it.,Lagging
5,2023-08-02 04:05:51,I’m wondering why you can’t gift gold cards? And why why when you trade in cards you seem to get some of the same cards? Makes no sense to me. Y’all have folks out here who are actually acting a fool over these cards SMH,Sticker packs
3,2023-08-03 18:31:40,"I’ve had two people now download the game and me through my text link and I haven’t received my dice for it. 👎 And since I’m here, the stickers are never new. I get the same ones over and over again and I can’t get enough dice to keep getting them. But I do enjoy playing! I progressed really fast, but now I’m stuck.",Friends Not Showing
4,2023-08-03 03:08:21,It’s a fun game the only problem about the game is it runs on real money practically to buy dice without it you're hardly playing that’s if you want to get anywhere far into the game and rolls are so hard to come by days will go by and still you cannot play because of no dice.,More Dice Please!!!
4,2023-07-26 23:12:28,I like that you play mindlessly for a few moments with a good sense of progression then you forget it then do it again! I just hate all the extra pop ups asking me to pay real money… this game ain’t for that get rid of all the extra crap on my screen and put it on like one menu!,It’s kinda cool
3,2023-07-30 20:34:38,Everything was fine until it went to net worth upgrade. Now it won’t let me continue the game. I’ve tried exiting out the app multiple times and going back to it and I even deleted it and downloaded it back and it still gets stuck on the same screen.,It was fun but I think the game crashed

5,2023-07-19 18:34:11,I was on my phone one day and my mom sent me this game in my text I said I’ll check it out but a few days after I never did but now that I checked it out I can’t stop playing it I play it every single day I love monopoly go!,Monopoly go

And as for the cards why do we continue to get the same ones never is there anything new and if that’s the case 50 days is way to long to change the sets. I’d continue to play if there were more opportunities for free dice.",Game is fun when you have dice.
1,2023-07-16 23:20:48,"This ain’t the one to play. The one you want costs $5 and is still probably a much better deal. This is the same kind of hacked out garbage you’ll see all over the App Store, the kind that’s only designed to mess with your dopamine receptors to convince you that you’re not just wasting your time earning meaningless virtual currency and giving your index finger a workout.

2,2023-07-15 01:13:33,"The game has gone from being fun and exciting to frustrating and losing its luster. Rewards/bonuses for completing challenges — such as the sticker collection, more than just blue and purples packs, should promise at least two 4 or 5 star stickers. Repeat stickers of 1-3 star value consistently, when only 5 trades per day are allowed feel’s like a disservice and scam of your players.",Went from fun and exciting to frustrating
4,2023-07-13 05:37:48,"I like it. It's a fun game. However, I do have one suggestion. Once you max out your shields, the board pieces that allow you gain shields should transform into something else then turn back once the shields are used. Itt makes no sense to keep collecting shields when you're maxed out.",I like it but I have a suggestion
4,2023-07-12 02:08:56,I really enjoy this game however I have come to the point where it is impossible to get new stickers to complete the sets.

5,2023-07-05 22:53:54,"This is a great game to play, WHEN IT WORKS. However lately all it does is crash or won’t even load in at all. I’m super disappointed and hope it gets fixed cause it’s an awesome game to play when it’s working right.",Game crashes but good game
1,2023-07-06 17:15:55,I liked this game at first and it was fun but it seems like the bug they have they forced the games to restart and or shut down in the middle of gameplay that I just went ahead and paid for the classic version. This issue they having effects the game to much I rolled the dice one with 175 rolls left and the game shut down I got back on and had 10 rolls and 105k less money… it’s annoying so I’ll just play the traditional monopoly it’s way less headache,This game WAS fun but…
5,2023-07-05 20:47:15,Was great up until today my game crashed while I was in the middle & now it won’t load past 30% To Begin …. I am very upset right now as I look forward to Playing PLEASE FIX it & Ps: It Would Be Nice If You All Can Throw In A Few Extra Rolls For The Glitching Inconvenience !!,🥺😩
5,2023-06-20 08:19:38,I didn’t want to download and listen to everyone else but for some reason this game is very addicting. I downloaded it and been checking back in on it almost every chance I get.,Honestly was skeptical but addicting
5,2023-06-15 15:33:26,This is this is just the best game in the whole entire world like I can’t even say the detail is good but they add characters to it like you can get London and everything it’s like the best eyewear get it. You don’t have to pay any money to get it though.,The best
4,2023-05-18 13:24:35,We don’t need 3-6 ADDs everytime we run out of rolls/money. We can see that. 1 pop up I can understand but not as many as you have. Also dice regeneration is way to slow. Over all it’s a fun game would be 5 stars but those two things need to be fixed.,Too many ADDS!
3,2023-06-14 17:10:11,"The game itself is fun but be prepared for a TON of pop ups. And you don’t just get one at a time… you get 4 or 5.   They did a recent update and now I don’t get most of the money awards that I am suppose to get.  I once had achieved something and got 100 rolls and like 12.4 million … I only got the 100 rolls and zero money.   I just got 100 rolls and 2.1 million… again I got the rolls but zero dollar change.   They do not want you contacting them. They hide their contact us form on their website and then only give options for developer, press.   I tolerate the pop ups for now but likely will delete app soon.",Glitch and too many pop ups
1,2023-06-11 03:43:45,"The biggest drawback to the original game imo is how linear it is and how little your decisions influence anything.  Unfortunately that seems to be about the only thing this takes from the original..  The graphics and gameplay are top notch - there is some seriously high quality craftsmanship behind the game, but oh man I’m half convinced this is a study on addiction with how literally everything feels manufactured to keep me entranced. Bit of a shame.",A bit of an insult to intelligence
1,2023-06-02 03:01:49,"Very disappointed in the creators of this game. I enjoyed playing it for awhile until you decided to “go woke”. I have no issue with ADULTS choosing what they want to do or be, but this is a game geared towards kids. Why shove this in there faces? Several well know companies have done this pandering mess and have had record losses within weeks of that choice. If it is for adult entertainment thats one thing, but children should not have to be ambushed with this stuff.",Pandering to “wokeness”
5,2023-05-15 17:21:37,This is another great Monopoly game with a twist to make it fun and you don’t need anyone else to play. Although it increases your enjoyment to add your friends you really don’t have too. Excellent game again !  To Ari try Monopoly Solitaire it might be more of what you’re looking for.,Fun and enjoyable
5,2023-05-14 13:14:42,monopoly go is such a fun game you can play it even when your bored! I have been playing this game since 5am it’s so addicted I even fell the sleep playing the game ! so if your looking for a game to play here it is! It’s amazing please download you will thank me later,Monopoly Go
5,2023-11-02 14:11:51,It is a great game but maybe there should be a story along with it so people don’t get bored as much when on level 300 or something and they just quiet because it gets old and boring over time or similar to a story,Great game
2,2023-05-07 05:37:10,"First, I am a free game player, I will not pay to play anything. I love this game and love that there are no ads and would love to play more but the free dice take so long to earn, 1 hour for 5 dice, which takes anywhere from 45 seconds to 1 minute to roll the 5, even less if you use the multiplier. It would be cool to earn 5 every 15 or 20 minutes, it would definitely keep me playing more.",Love and hate this game!
3,2023-04-23 02:29:00,"Great game and I love it but stop forcing so many in game purchase ads. I start the game, automatic 4-5 pop ups. I run out of rolls, automatic 4-5 pop ups.

Second thing, you should implement ads to get more rolls and not wait an hour for 5 rolls or spend money to get rolls.",To many in game ads
2,2023-04-21 22:11:00,"After about 20 or 30 minutes the game just kind of starts playing itself and it reminds me less of playing a game and more of watching one of those slot machine games play.

1,2023-11-11 14:29:29,"This game is not fun anymore. You definitely have to spend lots of money to compete. You will not be able to complete the objectives, without having lots of help from lots of generous players. It also crashes often, so you lose rewards and progress. Can’t get compensated properly for losses on the game that are the app’s fault. Don’t waste your time or money.

The dice to money ratio is bizarre 30 dice for $5 make that make sense. Schem is on the current event with the wheels I collect little to none or keep rolling over them.

No point of buying the packs / money / dice. It takes the fun out the game.,Fun but
5,2023-10-15 00:58:12,Wow I never knew this was happening to me until I played it on my phone at last I feel like I am a super star now I have money I want to play a lot I want all of you guys to play this game called MonopolyGO every day and earn a lot of money,MonopolyGO
1,2023-10-16 14:38:14,"You have to spend too much money just to play and win events, prizes or good cards. You also don’t know when you’re close to completing the top event for the grand price. This go around you don’t get very many dice for completing each card set and you keep getting the same cards over and over. Also you have to get 2500 extra stars just to open the good chest but only to receive one new card. I am over this game now!!!!",Annoyed!!!
5,2023-10-09 23:06:23,It’s captivating!! Perfect free play for everyone! Game is very easy to understand. Only con- they have so so many ways they try to ask you to buy more dice rolls or other power ups for the game. You just have to ignore them and it’s all good!!,Great game but…
5,2023-10-08 21:49:20,"I love monopoly go so much because it is super fun and nice and it is really easy and challenging and if you guys get this app you should really like it and everyone should get this game and if you don’t, it’s OK that’s all the time that I have today. Bye !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 💯💕",I love this game sO much 💕
2,2023-10-09 03:56:09,This game is fun but the unwanted purchases are ridiculous! There have been several times where I’ve accidentally bought something because they have so many pop ups trying to sell stuff. Tried to get a refund but it won’t let me. Think I’m gonna delete the app. Literally got charged $20 for something I didn’t want!,Fun game but unwanted purchases
5,2023-10-03 13:38:17,"i’m rating Fivestars because I love the game monopoly, but it’s extremely pricey to play and not enough given for the price or the offer. Also wish they would release new cards or gold cards more frequently.",Love the game
4,2023-10-04 18:22:12,"I like the idea of the game and it is fun to play. However as you progress in levels, the amount you receive per space doesn’t progress as quickly. However it is still a fun game.",The amount per space is a little low
3,2023-10-03 20:22:44,I just did so much work this morning on monopoly for it to not even go through I now I have to redo everything I just did and on top of that it’s not even allowing me some of the toy pieces I get that is on my board. Monopoly get it together I love this game but I’m about to stop playing it with all these bugs in it.,Fix your bug issues MonopolyGO..
4,2023-10-03 18:51:10,"Suggestions for the app: 1. For partner events, add the option to work with just one partner to build the four toys, cakes, or cars  in total. 2. Partner events: have the option to remove a player  3. Add a chat. That way we can text other players",Needs upgrades but overall good game
1,2023-10-03 16:31:23,"I used over 600 rolls today, accumulated X amount of dollars, and spun a 20k contribution on my event piece today, all to open the app back up three hours later and it be ENTIRELY GONE. Let alone the game’s fun being demolished at the beginning of this new season, I now have to worry about every single action I make on this game being reverted and pointless. I’ve wasted too much money on this game to be getting screwed over by nonsensical faults.",100% of my progress for the day reverted and WASTED
4,2023-10-03 14:01:50,I was setting next to someone building the set up for us and they didn’t give me the reward’s like that person this game has to many bugs that needs to be fixed before they start them and the robot is a cheat as well,The new puzzle piece game
5,2023-09-28 18:01:57,I enjoy the game very much. The only issue I’m having is that is that it is being very slow to load. Is there any updates being done or what is causing it to load slowly?,I enjoy this game. Just one concern
3,2023-09-28 19:25:44,Fun game that I play with my 7 daughters in 4 states well………use to play with them. Now it will not load for me so I guess we are done playing. I’ve deleted & reloaded game several times but still it takes real long then gives me a error. Also it would be nice to get relevant cards when you finish a board.,Will not load!
1,2023-09-28 18:37:20,"This album of the game is terrible. You get very little dice as rewards. You have very little chance of getting your needed gold cards without spending an ungodly fortune.  Ever since they updated and went to this version the game is continuously crashing, it’s been down all day today. Now I’m getting an error message that I’m not connected to Internet while I definitely am. I’m thinking it’s about time to give this game up.",Ridiculous
4,2023-09-28 17:52:25,It's fun to kill time with but I agree with other reviews about constantly getting the same cards which make it close to impossible to complete an album. Be nice if they added a few more surprises to the game. Gets a bit redundant after awhile.,Decent game
5,2023-09-28 16:20:00,"I absolutely love this game , but i don't like how the new album has less rewards, it definitely makes it not worth playing , but i do enjoy it. The duplicate stickers are annoying and the system errors.",Great
3,2023-09-28 17:03:57,I love this game. I log on multiple times a day. My issue(s) are 1) I haven’t got a new card in a week to 2 weeks. And 2) I haven’t been able to log in all day and people have been destroying my board 😭 it says no internet connection but my internet is working just fine on other apps,Love/hate relationship right now
5,2023-09-28 14:42:02,Please stop trying to cheat people. Especially when we spend money on your game. Please fix the error messages that seemed to just pop up after I wrote my first review.,Where are the gold cards
5,2023-09-12 18:52:26,"My sister sent it to me and said “Download it it’s to fun you can play with me” and I was really skeptical at first but I was so happy after a few minutes, this is ad free and way better then any games I’ve downloaded 10/10!",Best game ever
3,2023-09-27 14:20:29,"So, overall the game is a good time passer. My issue is that a couple months  ago I won 800 rolls and then just today, I won 400 rolls and neither were added to my roll count. I have spent a couple few dollars on this game and this when I Win something, I want it. I sent a messages on FB, then in messenger and I have not gotten a response.",Not getting rolls
2,2023-09-27 11:12:19,"Ever since the update I feel like I’ve been getting played. Haven’t got 1 blue pack, no gold stickers (even the ones you’d assume would be easier to get), I can’t leave any money over night bc bots will take every last cent, I never win the max prize on the community chest anymore. Kinda feels like they’re making the game impossible now. Welp it was fun while it lasted.",Don’t spend your money on the game
1,2023-09-25 14:37:48,Initially I enjoyed the game. It was a fun quick way to enjoy my childhood favorite game. With challenges that made trading cards and achieving goals fun (5 stars). The game started feeling like a rip off when you have to spend money $100’s of dollars for dice. I had over 30k dice when new season started all I got was MULTIPLE repeated gold cards. I’m NO LONGER willing to share or recommend this game. DO NOT download unless you’re willing to sell your house in order to complete missions.,Not fun
1,2023-09-21 19:13:24,Used to be fun. Now the only way to progress is by spending ridiculous amounts of money only to have Bots the creators admitted to creating steal billions in Monopoly money with can equal over $100 in real money. The events are impossible to complete. They have so many glitches and know about them and do not care! Customer service team never answers. I’m so mad at myself for investing so much time in a game that turned out to be nothing but a miserable time!,Don’t bother
4,2023-09-19 19:40:15,I have this game a three but it could have been a four if we had more ways to earn dice. It takes to long to only get a few dice and after a certain point of the game you’ll have to buy dice and the cost for the amount of dice is too much.,Dice
3,2023-09-16 06:49:06,"Like others said, it’s a fun game, but they don’t give out any gold stickers, it’s almost impossible to get them. So many duplicates. Monopoly Go, if you are following your Facebook trading page, I hope you see how many people are complaining and wanting to quit playing. Your going to start losing customers",Fun but they are greedy
4,2023-09-14 23:49:42,"Okay love this game and the whole concept, been addicted to it actually, but I just hate that their being stingy with the dice 1hr for only (6-8) dice seems ridiculous. Especially this challenges give you little time to complete and I’m pretty sure you need 3k dice to complete these challenges.",Love it but…
4,2023-09-12 20:25:07,"The game is great, my only problem is only being able to get a 10th of your dice per hour. I don’t think it should be changed too crazily as progression will speed up too much for players, but maybe doubling it would be a good balance for improvement.",—
5,2023-09-04 02:06:00,Very addicting… very fun but alway feels rigged.. with all the duplicates. Also I have noticed dice are started to disappear or all not being giving … && it glitches a lot which cause issues with rewards as well !! But. Overall is fun but frustrating lol,Umm
4,2023-09-07 16:52:54,The overall game is a fun and addictive game but on the flip side when you have a game that is linked through the community limiting the game to only 5 trades a day with the amount of time it takes to complete the stick sets is stupid at least double the 5 trade limit to 10,Great but bad
5,2023-09-04 00:34:38,I need something to pass by time once in a while and this MonopolyGO and Design Home are my two favorite games that I would actually enjoy spending a few extra $ on once in a while when I need to.,Fun game!
5,2023-08-26 23:56:12,Well I love the game but I don’t understand how they keep takin my rolls🧐‼️ Like I went to bed with over 1500 rolls and got up to just 70😡‼️ Also it’s like they want to put money into this game in order to get new cards or the ones u need‼️,Just don’t understand
1,2023-08-31 04:47:23,You can’t complete sticker albums unless you get stickers from the game only. I don’t see the point in trading stickers hoping to complete the album if the game won’t give you the stickers needed to complete. There’s literally no point to keep playing if they won’t give you the gold stickers needed to complete the albums. Then they had try to sell you missing stickers. The game is pointless and they just want your money.,What’s the point?
4,2023-08-29 16:36:58,"The game is pretty addictive but sometimes doesn’t feel as random as it should, but I’ve been playing for about 2 weeks now and have been really enjoying it. It s shame that you don’t have to spend money in order to have fun.",Good overall
2,2023-08-29 09:32:46,I have contacted several times about not receiving items that I was supposed to receive from purchasing. I have spent enough money on this game that they should respond to me immediately. I am very disappointed and although I like the game. I don’t think it is ok to spend a on something and not receive it and then don’t get a response back. Shape up scopoly,Poor customer service
5,2023-08-24 14:55:13,I absolutely love this game! Only concern is my friend tried sending me a sticker and on his end he sent it but on my end I never received it nor did I get a notification saying that he sent it. Please help me figure this out,Small bug
5,2023-08-21 06:53:19,"I love this game, only phone game I play anymore. Only problem is running out of dice & have to wait hours to get a good game in again. Also logged in 7 days straight & claimed my reward but didn’t even get it. It started me back at day 1. 😩😩😩",Great Game but..
3,2023-08-21 14:11:13,"I was obsessed with this game I found out that if I just saved up my money and wait for wheel boosted I can get super ahead into the game, but then this morning I found out I was completely robbed of 6 billion. Exactly 6 billion. I don’t have this Person added, and it’s really unfair I know when you heist something it always scaled down",I love the game but
5,2023-08-20 17:51:57,"The game is extremely fun, I enjoy it very much. I just wish there wasn’t so many pop ups trying to make us spend money and the pop ups about adding friends. Why do you have to have it pop up so OFTEN!!",Fun game
5,2023-08-17 20:13:03,Really wasn’t expecting the game to be this much fun. I’m actually encouraged to buy the real game now I’ve learnt how to play. You will enjoy Trust me. Don’t try and rob my bank and shut down my place after this great comment please please please.,You will enjoy
3,2023-08-20 03:54:21,"Honestly, it’s a fun game and very addicting. It’s just the more you level up the worse it gets. Doesn’t give you more dice as you level up on boards it just stays on 50, stickers are VERY hard to get which makes it difficult to complete sets in order to finish the album, and properties get insanely expensive to upgrade.",Ehhh
2,2023-08-18 11:17:00,The game could be fun but there are way too many in game pop-ups and to add to the annoyance some will have the close button at the bottom and some on the upper right hand corner. It’s especially irritating when you have a timed bonus and the timer is wasting away counting down and you can’t do anything to make the pop-ups close faster.,Too many in game pop-ups
5,2023-08-05 15:11:10,First of all this game is so fun to play and really easy to learn. You get to play with friends and more. There are many worlds to complete and I like how games you have to complete.,This is one of the games I would recommend and here’s why.
3,2023-08-11 18:06:18,I participated in this challenge and was in 2nd place probably about to advance to 1st as the timer was running out I hit a bank heist with 10 sec remain and completed it as fast as possible when done the challenge was over and I still have yet to see what place I finished in or receive my reward.  What a Big waste!!!,Be aware
1,2023-08-10 17:07:30,"Because this game cheats, I got two people I believe are not accounts and as you get higher up those two participants can attack you nonstop but you can only attack them once, I was enjoying this game until the non stop attacks, and unable to do in return, your supposed to be able look them up, but when do they don’t exists, was a fun game til the cheating, even when playing winning prizes you don’t always get your prizes",Giving a 1
5,2023-08-03 18:43:14,Me and all my family has iphones we all play together and we connect now just because if this game are family was broken up until this game and love it wish the owner the best ❤️♾️🗣️,Me and my family
3,2023-08-04 23:16:07,"The game is fun, I like harassing my friends with it, but there’s a big problem. I WASTE SEVERAL MINUTES JUST CLAIMING DAILY REWARDS. PLEASE let me skip the animations! I get it, you spent several hours coding those animations, but sometimes I only have a little bit of free time and can’t do anything because I spend all of my free time watching money animations! Please please PLEASE let us skip them.",Skip Animations
1,2023-08-04 21:52:00,Would be a 5 star game if it weren’t for the blatant cheaters in the daily tournaments. Always losing to a person who can get over 10k points within 2 minutes. Oh? Someone else somehow took 1st? Don’t worry that cheater will comeback with another 10k within a minute. Kind of makes the tournaments useless. Will never get 1st place cause there’s no way to report people for cheating. Add a report option and/or ban cheaters from tourneys. Do that and this’ll easily be 5 stars.,Cheaters in Daily Tourneys
5,2023-07-28 05:35:26,Only thing bad I have to say if you are friends with someone shouldn’t you be able to message them on the “MonopolyGO app “? That way you can ask them about stickers,Simple yet why hasn’t it happened?!
5,2023-07-24 15:26:14,This game is AMAZING there are absolutely 0 adds you make new friends and you can invite your other friends or family etc. You get to destroy and rob banks along with building so I think that you should consider downloading this game !!,I love this game
3,2023-07-24 23:13:25,"Honestly when this 1st came out it was a none resistance game, now it’s like it’s nothing to look forward to like the baking episode with 4 others was a good concept to keep coming back to play. Now it’s just the same thing roll for a lil of nothing now and it’s way to long on the card episodes to only keep getting duplicates",Blah now
5,2023-07-23 04:02:58,It began when my fiancé started her rolling addiction…hours she would spend pressing GO!. She began trading in the fb group they offer…which only added to the addictions.   I am currently in that group leading post…it is a itch I cannot scratch enough. It is a yearning for GO!,Download At Own Risk
3,2023-07-12 14:45:20,Would leave 5 stars if the game wouldn’t glitch out and give rewards like they are supposed to for stuff u have finished. I contacted twice and was told to wait 5 days but I don’t feel like I should have to wait when everyone else is getting their stuff sent to them cause MonopolyGO knows they messed up.,Unhappy right now

1,2023-07-10 14:41:09,"the game was great at first when you only had a little amount of rolls and the prizes were x1. The problem is as you level up you get more rolls and you are able to x50 or x20 the rolls. Even though that is great they dont let you land on any railroads when you use it. Anytime I do x50 on my rolls I don’t hit any railroads but as soon as I go back to x3 I hit railroads back to back. I have used 2,000 rolls using the x100 and didn’t hit one railroad in the span of 2,000 rolls being used.",SCAMMMMM

2,2023-07-07 19:28:11,The game is fun but the bankrupt system is so stupid. How can I rob somebody for $300 million dollars and the game tells me I bankrupt them but when I talk to them bout it they still have All their money? What’s the point of the game if you are not really bankrupting peoples banks? I robbed my friend of $80 million dollars when he only had $43 million dollars and it told me he was bankrupt but when I told him bout it he still had $43 million dollars.. it’s so stupid,Bankrupt

1,2023-09-20 18:42:11,This game is a good game but the higher your level goes the more expensive is to build. It gets so expensive that the amount of play you do or you earn is not enough to cover the expense to continue building. And even when you more dice is never going to be enough. You Luis it sells to high. Not worth your time or investment. As i always say money you invest in these types of money money you will loose. And it’s very frustrating.,Just want your money

I feel a lot of people are upset and frustrated as much as I am!!!,Just a headache
1,2023-10-28 21:59:25,This game isn’t as fun as it was in the beginning. Now you’re bombarded with ads to buy packages. The tournaments are becoming impossible to win and the tiles you need to land on in order to play in the tournaments happen less and less. The sticker packs whether won from spin wheels or if purchased are mostly duplicates which doesn’t make sense. Correct the algorithm for this game or people will begin to play less or not at all!,Not fun like before!!
5,2023-10-01 14:14:25,It is very fun it is just very hard to get tokens and it is nothing like real monopoly. My dad didn’t have time to play Monopoly with me so I downloaded the app and I found out that it does it. It’s not really like monopoly because I love monopoly.,About monopoly go!
1,2023-10-21 21:25:35,"There are so many things I could say about this game but mainly, the issue of getting repetitive cards even after you collect multiple duplicates then to have random people steal so much money that you play and build up is ridiculous because you won’t even have the ability to get them back. The mini games are cool but there needs to be a way to get cards without spending real money.",Frustration
1,2023-10-21 19:44:00,Why do I keep getting temporarily banned from the trading group? I haven’t done anything that violates guidelines? This is terrible of y’all I put money into the game I trade with people all the time and I send them proof of honest trades I have many screenshots that I have sent stickers and have gifted them too! Y’all are really ruining this game for me bc I haven’t done anything! I traded once today and I instantly get banned and y’all didn’t even give me a reason why?!,Ruining it for me
4,2023-10-19 20:38:47,"I understand that it’s supposed to be a challenge but these challenges are too difficult.  It was weeks before I got 1 new card. Nd it’s so difficult to build cakes. I’m not saying make it easy, but make it to where it can be accomplished",Cards and Baking competitions
3,2023-10-18 21:56:34,"So while me and my girlfriend were both playing Monopoly go! (Great game by the way) I noticed that she got a bank heist on me, she got the small heist valued at 4,342,000.  So why do I receive a notification saying that she hit me for 166,000,000 instead,  That's a X38.2 multiplier.  I'm just saying that it's unfair an doesn't make sense.",Why lie about how much is taken in a bank heist?
2,2023-10-04 02:00:28,What started as a fun game has turned into so many glitches and losing out on prizes and rewards. You have so many people playing games and contests that your servers can’t keep up and they continue to crash and to compensate they give you lousy rewards and an even more difficult time getting stickers to complete your groups.,It was fun while it lasted
1,2023-10-03 16:55:33,I paid for dice and packs never received anything not even my money back been writing support for over a month sent everything they asked and still got nothing but took my money off my card never refunded me keep giving me these reference numbers or whatever they are still nothing at all so I guess I’m just out of money and my rewards that I paid for wow do not buy anything from monopoly go at all it’s a scam,No good
5,2023-09-29 20:01:04,Thus the most fun game I've played in a long time! The only thing is I'm not sure how to collect shields to unlock the next set of shelves. I see shields but only have one on my shelf. I gdd as be several on my board 🤷🏾‍♀️. Either way it's still fun!,This is it!
5,2023-09-28 13:40:43,"I love it but lately there have been quite a few glitches that detract from my enjoyment. Ie: “ We're sorry, an error occurred requiring the game to restart.” This has happened about 10 times just now.",Love this game!
4,2023-09-28 21:18:00,After the app being down most of the day due to server issues everything I had in the game got deleted. I have to start all over from the beginning. Why should I be penalized for something that was out of my control??,Game Not restoring
3,2023-09-28 16:05:04,"It’s now glitching and  force closing. Maybe y’all should try adding something that’s more challenging. It’s getting kinda boring just going around the board. There’s no real Competition, and need to add a two player vs option or maybe something to make a player want to keep playing",Needs to be more challenging
5,2023-09-14 05:17:34,Not really into games but have always been a fan of monopoly so decided why not? Let’s give it a try! Yeah I get stuck for ever playing definitely a great way to help pass my down time at work.,Absolutely hooked
4,2023-09-28 13:37:01,"Today, while I was playing, the game crashed and was forced to restart. It happened right after I had just collected over 200 dice and another 100 dice for landing on the “Free Parking” tile. After which I lost all my dice and couldn’t get them back. Other than that, great game.",Game crashing
4,2023-09-27 03:16:27,I don’t understand how or why we get all these extra duplicates cards and barely half of them gold cards and when we do receive a gold card and have extra why we can’t send them like the other cards,Gold cards/Duplicates
1,2023-09-26 19:38:52,"My biggest complaint with this game is how you cannot block people!!!! People constantly will target your landmarks who aren’t even in your friends list or on the local/global leaderboards. They can heist you and target your landmarks constantly, but they are nowhere to be found on your end and can only hit them back ONCE. It’s actually insufferable. This needs to get fixed ASAP seeing as it has been going on for months.",ADD A FEATURE TO BLOCK PLAYERS
3,2023-09-25 19:10:11,"I’ve tried using the invite button through Facebook and Snapchat so my friends can play with me and I can get dice from inviting them, but the issue is the invite does not work it just sends the person the link to download the game and that’s it. Kinda irritating, hope it can be fixed.",Invite bug
4,2023-09-25 14:01:43,"Love the game and it was def fun at first but now it’s becoming to hard to complete the different task in the game. Everytime we level up, we should get more dice. It shouldn’t be this hard to complete the sticker challenges. We are having to spend lots of money to get what we need.",Review
1,2023-09-24 16:25:42,"The only way to get anywhere in this game is to spend money over and over. Sure at first in the lower levels you have a lot of fun and get addicted. And then you get to the higher levels, never have any rolls, upgrades are so expensive you can’t complete boards for days, and trying to complete sets is a joke. They’ll give you 100 duplicate one star cards before you get any new cards. It’s ridiculous.",Money money money
3,2023-09-20 00:14:53,Started playing and was enjoying it until I saw that my piece wasn’t being moved the number on the dice but 1 number higher or lower.  No one wants to play a game that isn’t fair and it only happened when I was close to getting a reward.  I also never get get stamps that I need. Very disappointing.,Disappointed
3,2023-09-19 20:30:37,It would be nice if it were easier to get dice or reach the unrealistic goals to get the dice bonus. The computer seems to know when you’re close so it’s rarely ever attained.  I’ve had dozens of friends click my friend link and join but haven’t received anywhere close to the referral dive bonus either.,Easier to get dice
5,2023-09-04 22:30:59,So at first it was all about my shotty. You know what I’m saying I was trying to get up in there and she said maybe you should play this game and I thought to myself maybe if I played as she gave me a little sloppy top,I mean it’s All About the Money man
3,2023-09-13 13:53:16,"I love the game but I wish you got more rolls, 6 rolls after an hour is kinda annoying… also it’s hard to get gold cards to complete the set I have so many doubles of cards I already have I’m starting to feel like I’ll only receive the gold cards if I spend money on the game and that’s not fair.",Good game but these are annoying
1,2023-09-12 13:05:26,This game starts off giving you all kinds of rolls when you first start. Land on the railroads all the time. After now playing it for a month it seems like I can never land on railroads. I liked playing it right away but now I’m getting annoyed. It’s like it’s doing it on purpose to get you to spend money. Plus daily quest hasn’t been giving me my rewards and customer service has done nothing to help. Mad customer here😡,0 if I could
2,2023-09-12 00:20:53,It's a fun game but there are some things that need fixing!!!! How can u be friends with a person and still can't find them to send cards? The cards and the dice are the most irritating thing from the game you should increase the dice in all aspects and we should be able to trade gold cards too....also when u get a double you should have a free spin following that,Its okay
3,2023-09-11 19:25:13,I have actually spent money on this game and it’s already hard enough to complete challenges. You have to watch your rewards. They only give them to you every third time. Do better monopoly. I know you are making a fortune with this game.,Always having problems giving you your rewards.
2,2023-09-11 13:35:59,"It’s seems that everytime I’m about to win the big amount of dices, I get a error sign and it starts about 6 rolls back.. don’t know if this is a actual problem or you do not want players winning the large amount of dice rolls and purchasing them instead.  I get it with all the purchases you have, you rather  have people spend money then actually win.",Glitching
1,2023-09-08 15:32:12,"They have mad the game incredibly hard to play without spending money. The new update makes it harder to get dice, harder to finish albums, and lower rewards on everything. Sticker packs give out duplicates most times. They raised the cost of the duplicate vaults without raising the rewards it gives out. The free dice gift from Instagram was lowered. The game is no longer fun to play unless you have hundreds of dollars to spend on it.",Impossible to Win Without Money
5,2023-09-01 13:43:18,They want you to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this game with in app purchases just to be able to complete tournaments and card sets. Don’t get involved. Unless you have a bunch of money to waste.,Money hungry
1,2023-09-02 21:04:24,"This game is fun, but you have to pay to really enjoy the game. You don’t stand a chance in their daily tournaments or weekly challenges unless you buy dice. Every time you try and play you are constantly bombarded with ads and pop ups encouraging you to buy more dice. At this point the game feels like a pay to win scam, I would avoid it at all costs. You’re better off steering clear of this glitchy predatory shell of a game.",Pay to win Scam
4,2023-09-02 08:32:50,I actually have a Monopoly Collection of all types of Special Edition Monopoly Sets. This app has been on my pad and phone for months and I never thought I’d have the time to play. Randomly turned on at 4am and it brings me back to my FAVORITE Board Game ever. Nothing but time and a business mind to conquer all.,Leisure Time
5,2023-08-30 01:41:59,I love the game. Very fun interactive. And a great pass time my only complaint is I would love to be able to trade for gold cards they are hard to find. Or just make a gold trading card day event. Just a suggestion,Trade able gold cards
4,2023-08-30 14:41:49,"Absolutely love this game ! But I’ve had a couple complications with the game not rewarding me things and I’ve reached out to the app makers 3 separate times now and never heard anything back , this was over the course of 3 weeks , but other than that the game is awesome , it passes time and is super addicting !",No help
5,2023-08-12 01:02:10,It’s really good I would recommend getting it if you don’t get bored fast I also have a suggestion that you let  friends be able to give other friends dice if they want thanks tho !,It’s really good
1,2023-08-27 16:54:49,"The game is fun and sometimes addictive, so when you make purchases in app and don’t receive them multiple times and hardly win rolls through challenges it takes the appeal away. Please refund me for my last few days of purchases I have not received and fix the issue with in app purchases. You all said it was fixed Thursday and I’m still experiencing the same issues even with the update.",In app purchases
1,2023-08-24 15:38:12,Had to delete this app I advise not to make any purchases on this app as you might not receive what you purchased I contacted support about me not receiving what I purchased got nothing but the run around still waiting a week later for a response they said it would be 48hrs still haven’t heard anything basically a scam to get people money good game only if you don’t make any purchases,Don’t purchase anything you won’t receive it
3,2023-08-18 16:16:23,"Honestly there needs to be a better system in place. I’ve been scammed out of trading cards too many times. I’ve invited 10+ people to the game and somehow they win better rewards, complete their albums, and get better opportunities in the game than I ever have. I’ll probably delete the game if the algorithm isn’t fixed soon.",Mmm
1,2023-08-15 21:36:21,The game is basically fun and they have some events which are enjoyable…….BUT…..get ready to spend money. You only get 7 or 8 depending on your level every hour. This last literally 3 seconds. If you want to play for a little while you have to spend money!!! It gets quite expensive. The events are virtually impossible to complete without spending money……which takes the fun out of playing!!,Get ready to spend a fortune!
4,2023-08-15 02:45:08,"The game says trade with friends but it’s really set up for “gifting”. We are supposed to follow your Facebook to trade with random people while weeding out the scammers. Make a trade mode, where 2 people can select each other and the stickers we are trading and should receive. Tired of being scammed.",Fun game
1,2023-08-13 03:45:38,This game has the potential to be phenomenal however it’s a money grab… spend money get more dice and Monopoly money however you will win cards only get the same ones over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Oh yeah and you can’t trade cold cards. Other then that it’s great to keep your mind occupied every 8 hours when you get free dice as well as every hour when you get 6 free dice.,Good game yet annoying
3,2023-08-12 19:30:02,I hate that u have to wait an hour for 7 dice then you get the same stickers over and over again another thing I feel like it’s a scam because u get so close to completing something then it glitches to where u keep passing over the things you need it can be a good game but you need to fix this crap,It’s good but it’s lame
5,2023-08-10 00:48:24,Wished there was a way before a trade goes through both cards show up to each party and both parties have to agree before it goes through. And if it’s a gift just add a gift for the trade for it to go through.,Scam trades
3,2023-08-11 21:16:13,Literally so rigged for me when it comes to shield. How am I going to go to jail like 6 times in a row but can’t land on a shield. It’s so annoying. Other than that it’s ok. Just kinda boring when it gets to harder maps because they give you a little bit of money and dice and that makes it harder to level up faster.,Give Me Shield
5,2023-08-05 18:41:46,Really nostalgic way of taking me back to when I was a kid trying to run the world. I feel like this game is one of the best ways to get away from the troubles of the world and and stay in the Monopoly universe for as long as I can. Have fun everyone.,Fantastic
5,2023-08-02 13:24:21,This is one of the funest games because it's easy to understand and good for no wifi and no ads (idk about the wifi part) but no ads!!! I recommend it for travel and long car rides,Monopoly  go

2,2023-07-25 22:12:02,Tbh the game was very fun and addicting to play at first but after a while they don’t give you new stickers just always gives the same duplicates. It’s very annoying plus the dice rolls need to go higher as soon as you finish a board should receive like 200 dice rolls. The golden stickers you can’t ever trade it doesn’t make sense. I haven’t spent a $1 on this nor will I !! They need to upgrade the game BETTER !!!,Monopoly Go

I went around the board multiple times I didn’t start getting anything until I was close to my dice being gone so I can buy more right?? It’s a gimmick y’all just want people to buy dice people are out here selling stickers on eBay, then you no longer let people receive free dice with Facebook friends  it just stops.

5,2023-07-16 15:13:43,Monopoly is my favorite game on my phone because it’s very graphic and you can make friends with people they might take your money but that’s ok you can make more money by building and going on different maps !!!,Monopoly go

3,2023-07-13 17:37:19,I feel that would should be able to send more card to our friends. It only lets you send up to the 3 star level but nothing higher then that! If we have the extra to give away and it’s a higher star level then we should be able to give that too!,Card trading

2,2023-10-25 22:23:46,The only way to win tournaments or get pretty much anywhere in the game is to spend money. Getting all of the available rewards for one tournament would take thousands of dice. And there’s no way to get that much regularly without paying for them. So you’re stuck getting the scraps while people can literally pay to beat you. Disgusting.,Pay to win
5,2023-10-19 12:25:12,You just go around and around the board with Infinite rolls I don't even see why it's called monopoly It's the most repetitive and pointless game I've played and I love the real monopoly so this was a disappointment,What is the point of the game

2,2023-10-12 04:24:25,Game starts out SUPER FUN! But sadly as you progress you realize the game is rigged so you have to buy rolls and album card packs to get ahead.

I don’t understand why y’all would lower the dice for set completion but put gold cards in every album which would have it harder to complete! 130 dice for finishing a set is ridiculous like u are cheating us out of the experience.

The least the developers can do is make the game better so that people's money isn't wasted because we all know they get plenty of it.  Do better 🤦🏻‍♀️,Rigged
2,2023-10-22 23:18:43,"It has not the same feeling of real monopoly so you can play it, but it doesn’t have like well. You don’t have like New York you can play and I just will feel like you’re in a tycoon so I hope you feel this way when she play it so it’s not really a good game. I’m still gonna play it but two out of five stars thank you for reading.                                                         Love,Cmkaminski",Meh
4,2023-10-21 13:40:12,So i wish you guys can add new cards from deck as in the ? Mark cards and as well where we can steal dices from our friends and use dices to get new cards for our album to unlock our dices basically trade in dices for a card and add more tournaments please,Some new ideas to the game
5,2023-10-10 19:14:50,To this game! I’ve gotten to level 28 and so far so good have not yet gotten bored of it! Whenever in an uncomfortable situation arises this game keeps me occupied. It’s a little different than actual monopoly but I likes it a lot! Try it out!!!,I’m addicted…
5,2023-10-07 14:21:20,Hi this game is very good but I wish you could add more level I’m not finished with it but I don’t want it to end oh and I have a little problem when I get a pack I never get I new one and I barley have any,Good but only one problem
1,2023-10-07 20:05:49,This game is a total and utter SCAM!!   I’ve spent real money on this game and it seems as robot players or random newbies just get ahead of you. Every single event there is the game just makes it so you never win. So far I’ve played every season event and always get paired with someone that doesn’t contribute at all and never win any prize at the end. Today is my last day as I give up and delete the app for good. This game is not worth playing day and night,DO NOTTT DOWNLOAD!!!!!
5,2023-10-06 01:00:20,I’m in middle school and I absolutely love this game I play it every single day there’s always new updates and new stuff every week my mom is on level like 170 so she’s loving this to and I can’t believe how addicted I am to this game,How is this free
5,2023-09-29 09:49:23,I’m only rating so people can see. When you make billions from a mega heist and gain a 4 star or 5 star card you need the game says error and restarts! Then takes all of your money and the card you needed away!!!,Scam!
2,2023-10-05 18:51:28,"First off the higher u get in the game the more money they should give you. If you’re going to raise prices of every single thing, give more freaking money. Secondly, you’re making these challenges impossible to win unless we pay into the game to get more dice to be able to get more in order to go towards the challenges. It’s ridiculous.",Not enough
4,2023-09-29 14:08:21,I had to start a new one because after I updated it I couldn’t get it to load so I had to delete it and start all over again I wasn’t very happy about it other than that it a fun game!,Not happy about starting over again!
5,2023-09-16 03:40:42,I love this game! I really like the fact that I can play with my Facebook friends. They can destroy something on my board and I destroy something on theirs. They also can make you money or take your money. It’s fun and I just love it.,Loving it
3,2023-09-28 18:33:57,"The game has been bad since the last update. I’m mainly getting repetitive one and two stars. I can’t even complete the side missions. During the cake event, I was only able to complete one cake. The game has terrible loading issues, like today. I haven’t been able to load the game for hours.",What’s going on?
3,2023-09-28 16:48:23,"Overall, love the game but the crashing is becoming annoying. I was playing and got a bunch of dices then all of a sudden the game crashes and now I can’t play until the crashing stops. It loads then states the internet connection is not apparent. I’m definitely connected. I just wanna use my dices 😩",Random Crashes
1,2023-09-26 21:39:52,I’m not understanding why everything is rigged and so high priced on a free games every season they make u spend more money with less gift you report not receiving and still don’t recieve this game is rigged I wouldn’t spend money after 200$ I still have yet to recieve a new card not even a 4 or 5 star card none the less I have to spend over 3billion to build I will enjoy free dice from now on this is ridiculous,Unsatisfied customer
1,2023-09-22 10:47:35,The levels are becoming too much to complete and giving 50 dice is not enough. Everything thing is increasing except the rewards. Waiting a hour for 15 dice is pretty ridiculous. And we should not be receiving duplicate gold cards that we can’t do anything with. The game has become quite boring now because it’s becoming harder to complete the challenges due to the low level of rewards.,Rewards aren’t worth it
4,2023-09-21 14:01:24,Love the game my friends and family play all the time the only complaint I we all have is the wait time to get dice it’s way to long I mean a hour for 8 dice is insane the time limit could be cut down that’s for sure other than that I really enjoy this game,Monopoly!
5,2023-09-12 01:40:16,Monopoly go I have the board version I love this game are you so play it since I was four but I kind of didn’t know how to do it but now I really know how to do it online I love it it’s amazing,I can join my Pham that can play with my family I love it
5,2023-08-30 17:58:51,Wish y’all would not give us so many of the same stickers all the time switch it up geez we all struggling to get these gold stickers that y’all won’t give us please help us help you,Stickers
2,2023-09-12 00:20:46,"I only play during events as otherwise its kinda boring, you very rarely will get the card pack or even close to it in the community chest , and prize reels are rigged and glitch alot to the game’s advantage.. the whole goal lately is to get you to spend money. Thats why you have to close like 5-6 pop ups as soon as you open the game",Wish they did more events
1,2023-09-08 20:57:40,"I’ve played this game pretty much from the very beginning, at first it was very enjoyable and then quickly became addictive. With the most recent round of stickers though the game has noticeably gotten harder to collect stickers and complete album. Also noticed the wheel bonus very rarely gives out anything other then the 2 star pack. It seems you have to spend an absurd amount of money to get anywhere now.",Greedy game
3,2023-09-02 08:22:24,"Great game and very addictive however for me it’s got to be the tournaments. It’s a little unfair getting into a tournament and some one has 10,000 trophies in less than 10 minutes. Unfortunately getting good prizes in hard. Anyhow the game and the concept is Great and I will continue to play until It gets old. Thanks",Just my opinion
4,2023-09-01 19:09:05,"It’s fun, something to do when your bored at home or bored at work. Friends all play it, fun to try to trade cards with each other. The game is definitely a cash grab. There’s really no point to playing the game. The amount of dice you’re rewarded with is never worth it.",Fun but money grabber
5,2023-08-17 03:20:13,"I can’t get enough of this game. It’s very addictive to play while on my lunch or not busy while at work. I also play while eat dinner, and get no complaints from the lady of the house, because she play’s also.😂",Monopoly Go
4,2023-08-25 19:51:54,It would be 5 stars I love the game addicted I would say but recently I have been trying to buy the side games and it accepts it then says error but still charges me and they say it takes 2 to 4 days to speak to anyone about it it’s ridiculous,Stealing my money
1,2023-08-23 11:18:11,"I love this game but this is becoming a problem. There are unauthorized charges on my Apple account that I’m currently disputing from this game. I’ve never had an app do this. And I have the fingerprint authorization for purchases on my phone, so how this has even happened is beyond me. The FB group for the game is rife with people starting to complain about this. WATCH YOUR CARDS AND APPLE PAY RECEIPTS!!! Considering deleting this app and trying to have them shut down for stealing from people",SCAMMING
3,2023-08-19 16:26:07,For weeks ive been needing only 2 gold stickers. How come yall will let us get duplicates of some gold cards but not allow us to trade those. Either let us trade with each other our gold cards or if we get extra gold cards we dont need let us trade them ibto a vault for only gold cards that we do need and will complete some sets.,PLEASE LET US TRADE GOLD STICKERS
1,2023-08-19 13:24:12,Don’t get it needs some more work for people who actually have to work because when you want to play it and come back you are broke which is fine when playing not when you are going to work and come back 14 hours later end of game. So when you sign off to go to work the  game you were playing should pause so when you come back you can continue where they were,Don’t get it
5,2023-08-05 16:13:58,I love the fact that you really don’t have to use your bank card to make purchases because they always giving away money 😍love it,Never a bored moment
4,2023-08-16 13:20:11,"The game is pretty fun especially with friends. My only grip is trading stickers, why give extra gold stickers if we can trade them? Either make them trade able or remove gold duplicates. Also allow in game trades so people stop getting scammed. Allow individual gifts or trades.",Sticker!
2,2023-08-12 13:13:47,Really love this game but I spent about $400 in a month just try to complete the card set. Instead I keep getting g the same cards. When you run out of five you either buy more or wait hours until you can play again.   After a while of playing and progressing you’ll eventually figure out that this game pretty much only wants you to spend money to get the full benefits of the game. And even if you spend the money theirs no guarantee that you’ll get a new card to complete a set.  I’m also sure that when trying yo complete the challenges that your competing against bots that entices you to spend more money.  A PAY TO WIN GAME!!!!!,Too expensive pay to win
2,2023-08-09 14:05:32,"I loved this game for a good while. Especially when I would get the bonus ‘100 dice’ for every new friend that joined from Facebook. The last month or so, I’ve been noticing I haven’t been getting those bonus rolls. And I have been having new friends join, which is obvious due to their boards being new boards. And scopely has refused to do anything to fix this issue",Great at first
3,2023-08-06 21:02:03,"I’ve done deleted, re downloaded, exited, opened and everything else you can think of telling me and for some reason my game bored is completely blacked out and I cannot play what so ever. Y’all need to fix this before I start blowing y’all messages up here in the comments and on the website FOR REAL.",My games messed up
5,2023-08-03 03:47:26,"I love this game. Actually keeps going with out having to start paying. Definitely recommend the download, I can even let my kids play if they want and they love playing too!",Favorite App 😊
3,2023-08-05 03:07:30,The game is fun to play with and I enjoy playing with my friends. The thing that is annoying is the stickers. I’m constantly getting the same stickers over and over. Plus we can’t trade gold stickers but I have duplicates of those. The sticker situation needs to change or something.,"It’s a fun game, but it can be aggravating"
4,2023-08-02 14:22:35,What I don’t like is a random player if that really isn’t a bot can hit you hard I’m a bank heist or take down and u look to revenge on that player and you can’t find them! If it’s a bot then I know it’s a strategy to get people to spend money to get back up again,Wow
4,2023-08-01 22:45:14,So I really like the game and even though it still has ads it is definitely not as pushy as other mobile games. I like the game play and all I would like them to add is just an option to play a real game of monopoly in the app as well as the main game,Almost perfect
1,2023-08-02 10:05:32,"I did not get a game award from a tournament, went to customer service, they replied it could take up to 5 days, then immediately blocked me. I can not even get to customer service now! Next within 20 minutes, they robbed the 48million from my bank that i just had purchased. That high robbery has never happened. I have ask for a refund, now going to Apple, if that don’t work i am reporting fraud.",Blocked from Customer Service
5,2023-07-31 22:15:36,Great game but it would be even better if we can chat with our friends on monopoly. Some of my friends I don’t know in real life and to put it frank I want to trash talk them as I destroy their entire board. Pls 🙏🏽 Make a chat box!!!!,Upgrades! ➡️CHAT BOX
5,2023-07-29 22:23:07,I love this game it’s so addicting but it’s hard to get cards u need with out buying dice and rolling hog numbers of cards to win prizes need to make it a lil less expensive and give more dice,Need to give more of the cards u need with out spending money
5,2023-07-15 04:23:29,This game is fantastic. I’ve never been so addicted to one in my life. Being on bed rest and not having much to do this game has been keeping me sane! I have all my friends and family playing along as well.,My ALL Time favorite game!
4,2023-07-28 14:00:55,This game is so fun and so addicting. But it would be awesome if we could traded gold stickers with friends. Everyone has so many extras just sitting there and others may need them to finish sets. So could you please make an update and allow us to trade gold stickers . Love the game .,Gold stickers
4,2023-07-26 01:54:56,"This is a fun game and all I can’t say no but please make it so you can go to your friends list and you can give people dice, money, and other stuff because once you run out of dice am you can’t do anything else but wait for like a hour so please thank you!",Trade stuff
3,2023-07-25 18:26:38,The stickers are ridiculous. Extremely hard to complete these albums. You’re asked to give up 1500 stars (a thousand+ tickets) in exchange for more 4 or 5 star stickers then you exchange them and get the same stickers you already have! They should definitely introduce a new pack that gives all NEW cars,Fun but a little scammy
1,2023-07-25 02:44:01,"The sticker and dice dispersion is extremely unfair. Takes forever to get dice, and when you do they constantly land on the SAME spots that do not help in any competition or building your landmarks. There’s been MULTIPLE times I’ve played, and landed on Jail 4-5 times in a row and never bailed ONCE. It’s impossible to get ANY stickers that are more than 3 stars unless you PAY. This game is corrupt unless you’re willing to pay REAL money for nothing that benefits you in real life.",Corrupt game
1,2023-07-23 08:37:03,"Read the reviews before downloading. My complaints are the same as previous reviews. 1. Once you run out of rolls, you are only reloaded with 5-8 per hour. 2. The sticker system is flawed beyond repair. You will have 9 duplicates of one sticker but can’t get the stickers you need. While other players are finishing the album for the second or third time. 3. The trading system is a scammers playground.",It Gets Boring after a while
2,2023-07-20 21:24:04,"It’s a good game, that is if I could play it. The prize distribution is unreal. And you can’t tap the screen to skip through them. You spend more time spinning wheels for pointless prizes and collecting stickers. I just wanted to play monopoly. Level 22 and I’m uninstalling it. Just can’t play it. Too slow and it’s giving me anxiety. Tapping my screen trying to move it along.",Stickers stickers and more stickers
2,2023-07-16 01:56:20,I really enjoy the game but I don’t feel comfortable investing in it due to the lack of customer support. I have been reaching about glitches that have resulted in missing rewards for a very long time now and received no response 😩. I can’t say in good faith that I’d spend any more money on this game because of that. It’s a shame because I really enjoy playing,There’s little to no customer support
5,2023-07-15 01:48:05,"I enjoy the game with no adds it’s awesome, will like to be able to remove ppl when it’s activity’s that involve others to help and they don’t help succeed.  Can also make a way to give and receive dice and money.",Enjoy

1,2023-07-10 15:12:06,"Idk who decided the “twists” on Monopoly would be a good choice. Within 5 minutes of playing the game you’re stealing money from other players, being told rich people don’t work for their own money, and causing property damage to others. What kind of influence is this? This isn’t building an empire, it’s playing the victim and being dishonest and chaos. NOT the game I grew up with nor will I ever play this again.

3,2023-06-22 01:23:21,"When it’s your turn and you move, it does not tell you what you land on and just does it for you. In my opinion it is not really monopoly because it only lets you push the go button and then just upgrade city.

2,2023-11-02 20:03:12,This game was fun when suggested but it’s definitely one where it’s set for you to spend more and more on in game purchases to advance in the game. You get the same base stickers and you exchange stickers in game for vaults that also contain repeat stickers. It’s really just the same challenges being cycled over and over.

1,2023-10-18 19:52:42,There’s a mod out that lets you get unlimited money dice that mod makes it hard to win a tournament when they start people already have 4k points even some with 15k points makes it impossible to get number 1 I had over 5 k dice still couldn’t get but 6th place please get rid mod or I just downloaded the apk files for it hack to looks like only way just win so get cards makes not even want to play anymore,Get rid of the mod
5,2023-10-16 04:58:55,They have a roll based number where you can only roll a few times.. but they give you a lot in the beginning so,Actually enjoyable
5,2023-10-14 17:56:00,When I originally heard about this game I thought it would be lame but I tried it out to see what the hype is about and now I’m absolutely hooked on this game and you should try it out for yourself 👍👍👍,Addicted to this game
1,2023-10-16 02:51:53,"The actual card game Monopoly go is fun. It’s a fast version of Monopoly, retaining some of the strategy, just at a faster pace.   This is not that. This is a dumbed down, mindless perversion of Monopoly. You know all those things you like about MG? Like buying properties? Or choosing where to build houses and hotels? This game has none of that. It’s devoid of any strategy, critical thinking and the ruthlessness that made Monopoly fun.   And to top it off, they make you PAY to roll the dice (or wait an hour) to keep playing. Honestly, they would have to pay ME to keep playing this idiot version of monopoly.   However, if you’re looking for a mindless game where you just press buttons and see yummy animations, this is your game.",Nothing like the actual game

Also they keep reminding you to join them on Facebook so you can trade stickers but it’s just a slap in the face because you CANNOT join the group, it doesn’t let you join.

But all of my spins have been terrible and have only gotten one cake finished due to lack of dice and such. It’s just really frustrating to play everyday and still not get even close to the prize and feel like the only way to win is to spend money on dice.,Disappointed
3,2023-09-10 21:02:27,I have fun playing game. But certain aspects give me pause. I don’t want to just drain my wallet. I don’t think you have long term goals in mind. Do you want the game to last for now. How about forever. That is a long term investment. Give me a reason to keep logging in. If I see you are just for money I am gone.,Giving game one more chance.

4,2023-06-24 04:14:22,"Only issues I see is trading cards. If you could change that to the way pokémon go has it would keep a lot more players. Each party has to ok the trade before it happens. So many people are losing out because of the scams.   And once your a friend you have to remain for 48 hours.   Second build dice quicker. One hour for a few dice is crazy. 10 hours to fill your day play.   Outside this the game is fun, and the multi events are great.   I do like the little updates here and there, but to make this game great, you need to do a little better.",Fun Game

The fast pace game might look harmless, but it is using gambling tactics to give your children dopamine boosts and keep them hooked.

You save up and have over 1000 wheels and when you use them you get very low numbers that barely move the gage. If you make a $3 purchase it gives very few dice and the cards are what you already have. Scammers!!!,It’s fun till it’s not

2,2023-07-20 06:35:51,Love this game. 5 stars all the way. Until today when I can no longer add friends and collect dice rewards for them downloading the game.

No response from support when I have attempted contact.,Angry!!

Number one after I open the game every day for the first time it is stuck nothing is working and number two if I get a reward it does not let me roll until they show that they gave me the rewards it is just so disgusting,Just a bug

3,2023-07-08 00:56:35,You definitely can tell it’s a pay to play game I’m sure in a few weeks I’ll delete it.

3,2023-06-09 20:54:05,I wish they would reset the. Sends every 6 to 8 hours instead of 24 hours. 5 sends is not enough especially when helping people. And I wish the gold cards wasn’t so hard to get. I won a purple pack and only got one gold card. Doesn’t seem fair since we can’t trade gold cards.,Sends
1,2023-06-02 13:21:46,I would rate this game a zero star if possible. The game was great until the developer decided to cram gay pride down my throat. Where does this nonsense stop. I want to be able to get away from the reality that there is a thought that this is not only morally acceptable but that it is normal and should be constantly force fed into the population.   Nowhere in nature does this nonsense exist other than the human race.  It is time for people to stand up for morals and not accept this nonsense!,It WAS a great game
5,2023-05-26 10:30:40,Look in the board game in real life no money flying in the air it was a little board for me I was tired soon when this came out I said “is there details in this game I trying and I said OOoOh I loved it the people where cute,Little people and PLAYING!

1,2023-11-09 00:57:17,Leaving another one star review. This game starts out super fun but it’s too hard to get the stickers you actually need and it’s really hard to get dice. You have to use too much dice just to get the same amount of dice back. I spent over 300 dice today just trying to finish my “quick” wins. So done with this game. I understand the need to make it challenging but it’s way too hard for a game that should be fun.,Frustrating stressful game
3,2023-11-06 15:29:46,"This game is fun and addictive with friends but the immersion is ruined by low framerate animations and laggy animations that are all over game. It would be nice is this game would run at higher framerates, at least on the higher end iPhones. 60 or 120fps and 120hz support would go al long way in the overall fluidity of the game",Needs better optimization
1,2023-11-06 12:42:28,This game was okay until the force you to try and trade with other people on Facebook to get cards. After 4 months I finally deleted this game because I would NEVER receive new cards that I needed during regular game play and people on the Facebook Monopoly page were scamming others and the page went unregulated. I refuse to purchase anything for extra cards or dice rolls. It was stupid.,Deleted
1,2023-11-03 20:06:27,this game is continuously to scam people. They are constantly having glitches. Nobody is in customer service even if you spend money it doesn’t matter it’s all fixed. Have had a lot of my dice taken from me and not giving back nobody replies the game was fun but now they’re only money hungry and even if you spend moneyand they have issues with the game they don’t repay you back. This game is not worth it anymore.,scam
2,2023-11-02 16:37:55,"Rewards don’t keep up with the cost to play at higher levels, and the newer updates make the game so much worse.

3,2023-11-02 13:18:46,Why do we keep getting the same stickers. This version was supposed to be easier to complete the sets. It’s definitely not easier. Then when you have the chance to trade gold stickers. Everyone needs the same gold sticker. Please switch up the stickers,Stickers

3,2023-10-15 19:09:46,I absolutely love playing the game however it’s not fair that we receive duplicate gold stickers and can’t trade them. The app needs to be updated.

1,2023-09-08 01:15:57,The game doesn’t give you enough rolls only wanting you to spend more and more money.. the sets don’t give you much and you can’t even get a gold card.. also if you have 80 rolls like me that it regenerates to it does nothing.. the game forces you to roll at 50 or more to compete with anyone which isn’t possible with out putting money in.. don’t waste your time on this trash game,Game is trash and only wants your money
5,2023-09-03 22:07:27,Awesome game to play love this and it is very fun to play with friends also to get more dice you have to wait in hour but if you complete task you can still play i highly recommend this game if you are bored,Awesome

3,2023-09-02 16:48:05,Shouldn’t i be compensated for all the boards i’ve finished without sticker packs? Considering newer players will get them every 3 completed with paying little to no money while I now have to pay within the billions to even finish one? Or how does it work exactly.,Getting Stickers for completing boards
1,2023-08-31 15:29:28,"I truly don’t understand the super high ratings for this “game.”  You, as a player, effectively do nothing except watch this game play itself.  “Rolling the dice” and choosing what player to “attack” are basically just illusions of choice or interaction.  Maybe there’s a small element of chance built in that’s fun for some people to watch.. like watching somebody else play a slot machine, maybe?  But seriously.. there’s almost nothing you as a player can do to do better or worse at this game aside from whether you “play” the app frequently or maybe if you went a long time where you didn’t bother to spend your coins on building “upgrades”",Do you like watching a game play itself?  Then this is for you!

5,2023-08-26 23:58:37,This is a super addictive game. I don’t like the repeat stickers but have been gifted stickers by personal friends (never from facebook app). I have spent a total of $1.99 on the game. I just wait for my dice and get the gift every 8 hours. Fun! Fun! Fun!,Love the game!
3,2023-08-27 14:20:35,"From my experience it was a good game but once you run out of dice you instantly get a pop up to purchase a bunch of stuff. Also when you launch the game it makes you dismiss like 5 advertisements before you can play, very disappointing.",It’s okay… Too many prompts to purchase virtual items
3,2023-08-27 01:25:24,I’ve probably spent about $3-$400 on this game. I’m not proud of it but you’d think they’d make the stickers easier to get. I’ve been waiting weeks for just one more sticker and no matter what I can’t get it. It’s a gold sticker too so I can’t even ask for help and we’re 4 days away from the reset. I’m very upset.,This game is rigged.
5,2023-08-24 23:06:50,I really was enjoying the game up and until I started on my album sticker. I completed SEVERAL sets WITHOUT the reward. I emailed them TWICE and sent screenshots. I NEVER got a response nor my rewards. SAD,Would have given a 5 star but….
1,2023-08-25 22:36:03,I started out loving the game addicted to say the least. Promised I wouldn’t spend money welp . Now I’m beyond annoyed that I have missed rewards cause of glitches and my iPhone and also made purchases that I never received and customer service isn’t the easiest to get to . And then I see everyone getting money and dice and rewards but I still haven’t received anything . So no more money spent and no more everyday all day playing.,Ugh

1,2023-08-02 18:56:10,I was enjoying the game until today. I made 5 or 6 about to be 7 million dollars In Monopoly money & I went on a bank heist and got all 3 rings. I was then directed back to the game board screen where I immediately noticed all my money was gone and I was down to 1 million dollars that’s very upsetting idk if it was a glitch or what but stuff like this can’t happen.

Yal should make us able to trade the gold cards if you’re going to be giving us duplicates of them everytime. it’s ridiculous. makes me want to quit the game,Trade gold cards

But now this game is boring, it’s hard to finish the sets they keep rewarding you with duplicates and if you trade you duplicates to the save you end up with more duplicates. I only get 6 dice and hour and I have people trying to scam me left and right over this game. I’m honestly over it will be deleting.",Scam energy

3,2023-09-20 00:12:40,I even made a purchase to see if add would stop popping up and I think it got worse!

It’s suppose to be a fun game but the owner of the game is money hungry it’s ridiculous. We get it but don’t have take the fun out the game. Bug with purchases hasn’t been fixed on my end.

It’s obvious the game doesn’t give you rewards to force you to buy rolls. Not to mention how you rarely get new cards. Or how you can’t trade good cards.  This game is centered around money and not the entertainment or interest of the players,Needs much work
1,2023-10-31 22:23:15,Statistically rigged it makes sure you use as many dice as possible so you have to buy more to finish the events. I spent well over 400$ just to try and get more cards I would hate to see what the people spend to finish all the albums if it’s possible. If I didn’t play with my brother on here I would of deleted it along time ago. I can’t believe I spent that much money on such a stupid game.,Rigged

5,2023-10-03 16:34:04,Man this game is cheating it keep pushing me back every day every time I pass a level and this new that we play I was on level three for all four people now I’m on level one again I’m bout to delete this game,I HATE THIS GAME
5,2023-10-01 12:02:32,I love this new monopoly! It’s free to download and play me and my family love sitting around the couch and playing it and you can be friends with people on your here so it’s like you ARE having family time.😃,My monopoly review
1,2023-10-03 16:21:43,The game can be fun. Though there always seems to be issues during events and things crash. Yes it’s nice to get gifts to try and compensate for losses but it does not give you what you truly loose. This toy event crashed and took away money and partner points not given. Also took points off the build not just a few. How can they honestly fix every one of us correctly? Disappointed.,Disappointed
4,2023-10-03 15:31:45,First it would load right away and now it take so long to load can’t even play without uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Frustrated and about to delete it all together,App slow loading
3,2023-10-03 14:18:05,Fix the game !!!!! It has crashed again ! And how will you compensate us in this one considering we are in The middle of the you making event ? Also we sure could use some new cards/stickers or even make the gold stickers tradeable .... today is day 2 and I can't get my daily treat,Crash
1,2023-10-03 14:16:36,"Just asks for people to spend money to get dice. There’s no real reward or point to the game. It has also been glitching every day for the past two weeks, losing any progress you’ve made if you can even open the app. I’ve no longer gotten dice from friends joining and the support team either ignores you or has so many other complaints they don’t get to it.",Not even worth being free
4,2023-10-01 19:09:27,"The game is amazing, but I don’t like the way the stickers are handled. Why give a duplicate gold card, if we are unable to trade/gift the card? Plus it is rare to get new card. Repeated duplicate cards is nonproductive. The way the sticker packs are handled is very toxic. Please increase new cards.",Stickers
5,2023-09-30 16:37:26,I was worried about this being the same as other games on the App Store but i definitely enjoy this more than others that i currently have downloaded,Great game
2,2023-09-30 18:05:09,Myself and a few friends thought cool we can play monopoly all the time now!! Definitely not how this works but I still play! The game needs a mode where you can actually play the original board game with friends and not just go around the board taking money from other players that they don’t even have,Not what I thought
5,2023-09-29 02:10:55,I don’t know if you guys saw my review but the exact request I made was answered. Thank you for getting monopoly back on track today and giving us a bonus for the delay! I love this game.,Thank you!
5,2023-09-28 17:22:00,Last night I spent $50 to get a bunch of dice and this morning I cannot get into my game. Is there anyone that can help me or give me a link to get in touch with someone I’m not very happy about this.,Can’t get in the game
2,2023-09-28 19:16:30,"Would be fun if it didn’t glitch so much. Won’t fill up my invite bar for free dice, even though I’m inviting and they’re accepting my invite. Today the game won’t even open right in the middle of a tournament. Almost impossible to get gold cards with higher stars without spending money on more dice. Last you only get 8 free dice every hour.",So many glitches
2,2023-09-28 19:12:17,"This was a lot of fun until it stopped working. It won’t open on my phone or my iPad, my son in another state says it doesn’t work anymore for him either.  Also, the packages to buy dice are way too expensive and pretty chintzy in what you get for the money. I’ll go back to playing Klondike. It’s just as much fun and cheaper to play.",Don’t work any more
5,2023-09-28 16:25:34,Ever since the update I can’t get into my Monoply Go.  Has an update been sent to accommodate the update of IOS?  So disappointed.  If I delete and reinstall will I lose everything?,IOS update
5,2023-09-28 16:15:52,I love this game and play it all day long but I really think the time for dice should be like 30 mins if not 15mins waiting an hour for dice is a little much and will make players not want to play the game any more,Dice
4,2023-09-24 13:46:21,Board 127 and 131 is the same board The Old West I don’t like that and the game is giving out less rewards than when I first started Playing months ago especially on the albums I’ve spent an undisclosed amount of money on this game so let’s be fair MONOPOLY,Repeat
3,2023-09-22 03:34:20,I absolutely love this game and I’m totally addicted. However I feel as if waiting an hour and getting 8 rolls is absurd. The stickers and all the du-locates is also insane. We should have a fair chance at stickers we need. We should also be able to gift rolls to people as well. Fixing to quit all together.,Rolls and stickers
2,2023-09-20 11:47:25,This game is definitely designed to make you pay serious money. The algorithms used do not give you the card you need. Definitely do not give you the rolls you need. You can’t trade gold cards by they give you multiple duplicates that are useless. They don’t give you the cards you actually need. I’m so fed up with this game,Designed to make you pay $
2,2023-09-17 15:04:53,I like the game the only downfall is when the bots start taking the money and it don’t be no one from my friend-list it be people that are not in the game  (you can tell by the pictures). Like the developers need to fix that issues because when they do a bank heist they take majority or even all of your money.,The bots are annoying
1,2023-09-19 22:10:42,"First off- capped dice? Cmon ridiculous. We should be able to get dice how ever we want. 2nd we should get more than 50 dice per map that we finish, I feel like it’s a way to tug us to play more. But how can we play more when we run out of dice? 3rd- why can we only trade 5 stickers a day? Nah we should be allowed up to 10 trades a day! This update is horrible. Please change it back to the way it was before this.",Crappy update
5,2023-09-09 15:50:02,If you like addicting games this is one but one problem it will be annoying and you can’t stop it,Please read before getting

1,2023-09-14 01:19:37,"All of the animations slow the game down WAY too much! And the amount of ads/sales that pop up before you can even play the game is ridiculous. If we want to buy more rolls, the store icon and all of the sale icons are literally right there for us to click on. We don’t need 5 of them to pop up in full screen before we even see where we are at in the game! Sheesh!",WAY too many animations
2,2023-09-12 06:47:59,"I’ve played this game and really like it until I realized there’s so many things that need fixed. I also have had too many rewards not given to me, mega heists turn out to only be regular heists, and losing spins on the wheel because of an “error” which takes my spin and finished color set from me. Super disappointed and sad to say I’m done with this app.",Scam
4,2023-09-10 15:23:26,I enjoy playing this game a lot! However I’m not giving it 5 stars for the simple fact that there’s only 5 trades a day. Honestly there should be a increase in trades. Maybe 10/15? Cause I’m assuming unlimited would defeat the purpose of some of the game play.,"I love it, but.."
4,2023-09-10 13:00:15,"I love playing this game. It is very therapeutic, however, the ads pop up too much, it’s too many that’s displayed on the screen as to where you can’t see the board, I don’t receive all my dice or money most times. Fix these bugs.",MG
5,2023-09-06 18:32:01,"My board is frozen unable to open stickers, roll dice, receive rewards, work on my cake. I have turn my phone off and closed out app many times.",Board frozen
1,2023-09-08 14:25:57,"I loved this game and am quickly hating it… I am back and forth with removing it, but hoping things will be fixed because I do enjoy it. Customer support is a complete joke. I have spent SO much money in this app and the amount of unresolved issues I have is absurd. It’s clear that the company is only in it for the money and have no actual regard to it’s customers, which is a complete shame. Such a disappointment.",Disappointment
1,2023-09-08 12:10:59,This person who isn’t even a friend on my game has hit my board over 20 times in less than two days. I’ve never had this problem. Support keeps ignoring me and I’m tired of it. A random player shouldn’t be able to hit me multiple times. It also won’t give me the option to hit her board or anything and I’m tired of it. I have pictures of how many times she’s hit my board too.,Over This Game
1,2023-09-07 21:03:09,"BOT FILLED, nothing left to chance. The entire game is rigged to get you just close enough to an award but either wait 7 to 10 business days to get the reward (that expired in 6 days) or pay money now to get it. If you try and save up money for a daily event. All of a sudden a brand new (not even anyone on your friends list!) comes in and just so happens to swipe away ALL of your saved up money. SCAMMERS",Greedy game. PAY TO WIN 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
4,2023-09-01 02:31:18,Overall I love this game. But now there is a gold card in every set. That cannot be traded. How often will we be able to get these cards???!!! Also what about these duplicates already? Don't give out duplicate gold cards if we can't use em!!!,Gold cards.
1,2023-09-04 17:44:03,This game is horrible you guys are giving us less payout for the new album. You put a gold sticker in every set! You have to wait a whole hour for 8 dice ! What are we going to do with 8 dice ! We spend billions trillions even and thousands of dice to finish a board and the payout is 50 dice and a few million !? Oh and let’s not forget our gold cards aren’t even tradable still !! 0/10 don’t recommend,Horrible
3,2023-09-03 02:12:38,"This is a truly addicting game, and really enjoyed it. But it’s clear that they are getting greedy and want people to pay to play with micro transactions.   Now I get that they are a company that needs to make money. But they tweaked it so much that it’s almost worthless to play with spending money.   Also, the rewards were massively lowered. So hitting a goal = less dice. Less dice = less playing time without paying.   Unless some changes are made to make it playable for people that would rather not spend money to get anywhere, I will be uninstalling the game.",Update is killing it for me
1,2023-09-01 15:24:04,"The game can be fun, but you are constantly bombarded with pop ups and adds trying to get you to buy dice and sticker packs. It ruins the experience. I wish you could turn those off. Also the game rewards players for spending money, so if you don’t buy the packs then you’re not going to win the in the daily tournaments or finish all the challenges. It feels very pay to win.",Paid content ruining the game.
4,2023-08-31 23:24:32,"I’ve been addicted to this game for a couple months now and while that’s probably not great, I do love it! I wish the prizes were consistent though, the last sticker album was way better than the one that is going on now.",Very fun!
4,2023-08-31 00:24:20,The game will is fun but every time you roll out of dice all the ads appears to buy more dice that’s is very unnecessary because if we wanted to buy some we could go the corner where the special offers are or the shop also,Dice gone
3,2023-08-31 12:23:50,Ok the game was very fun when the prizes seemed obtainable. It seems like the game begins to stall out when the players are close to winning to force them to make purchases to win. I don’t like that part. I also don’t think that ppl who haven’t built up their boards should be able to attack other players.,Hmmm
3,2023-08-31 02:18:05,Really hard to get stickers .. and it’s hard to go on the Facebook app and ask for them people try to make you pay money for them to buy . It hard to get help for the stickers that you need is too much money involved for freaking family games but it’s a fun game,To much money
2,2023-08-30 14:26:54,I the game starts off as very fun and exciting but the more you play the harder it is for you to get the cards you need. It’s set up where you can trade you friends and other for cards but a lot of times you get scammed for your card. I wish they would make it where you could trade the gold cards that would make it a lil better.,The thrill is gone!!
1,2023-08-28 18:55:17,"It’s hard to get dice because even when you level up and complete boards at higher levels, you still only get 50 dice. I have needed the same gold card for weeks and have had no opportunity to get it. You should be able to trade gold cards at least once throughout the event. It’s hard to complete the event for some, while others complete it multiple times.",Cards/dice
5,2023-08-26 01:05:25,This game is great although there is a few frustrating things like I went to jail seven times in a row this is annoying but that is not that important I think you guys did great,Awesome job developer
4,2023-08-26 13:11:56,"I love this game and play it a lot, but its annoying that you only have about 30 minutes of playtime until you are out of rolls and have to wait until the next day to get more. Overall though, its a fun game!",The wait is long
3,2023-08-26 01:46:24,"I love this game but I just bought a dice pack and it said I was supposed to get 40% more dice as well and I never received it so I don’t think I’m going to buy anything on this game anymore if ur not going to give the items ur offering especially for dice, little disappointing",Don’t know how to feel bout the game right now
5,2023-08-12 13:44:35,Making lots of fake money is fun. Challenges are fairly easy. Don’t like having to destroy others property. Seems counterproductive. Rather partner with friends and build together. But it’s great fun either way.,A lot of fun
3,2023-08-24 16:47:32,"Monopoly Go! Will give you thousands of duplicate stickers. Especially when you buy some of the package deals. If you’re purchasing some of the deals, you should be getting at least one card you don’t have if not in every pack then every other pack.",Sticker Albums
4,2023-08-22 19:28:24,Its a great game so far but if we going in this direction with it then it needs a few more features like multiplayer with friends and maybe a few game modes that friends can play together and stuff,Needs a few things
3,2023-08-21 00:04:06,Game is great. Addicting to play just the one thing that pisses me off is how many pop ups there are to buy stuff. Sometimes I just want to go straight to playing but have to close 5 pop ups to purchase stuff. One right after the other. Really annoying.,To many pop ups
1,2023-08-14 07:41:09,They make it seem all good til you need something it’s hard to win people are scamming when it comes to trades you barely get dice and or stickers you need the events are hard this game is crap I hate it and will be deleting after the sticker event is over never again I’m telling all the people who I invited to join to delete the game erase the data cause it’s a waste of space and time at this point,Don’t waste your time

3,2023-08-05 18:45:32,"I wish we got more dice. Waiting an hour for only 7 is really annoying. It’s fun to play, but also hard to get stickers because they never give out the ones you need.

3,2023-07-26 16:10:06,Hello I personally love this monopoly game on this app but the huge problem is that when you roll the dice it doesn’t count the exact number of rolls you do. I’ve counted each space I’ve moved and it’s either 1 less or 1 more then what I actually roll. This absolutely shouldn’t happen and needs to be fixed!,DICE

1,2023-06-30 20:53:51,Five stars I would write 10 stars but it’s so fun I just got it today. It’s like when you’re bored you can play in like once you finish the New York like your mat for New York to go to London and bananas and like you could like different like cities and countries and it’s like really fun when you’re really bored and you can also play with your friends. You can invite your friend to the game when I can download the game it’s really fun I really suggest.,So fun!
1,2023-06-29 15:47:53,I and many others in the original Monopoly Go trading group have found that we have been getting charged huge amounts of “in game” purchases.

1,2023-05-18 21:59:52,The game is definitely pay to win. I feel like you have to make purchases to be able to complete the album. Also for the tournament’s/races people spend hundreds of dollars on this game just to win. They get well over 15k points on those making it impossible to catch up without paying.

4,2023-05-03 00:14:20,"I’ve been enjoying the game these past few days, but I am tired of the constant pop-ups to buy more rounds every time I run out of rolls. I wish there was an option to turn it off. It’s annoying and ruins the fun.","Addicting Game, Hate The Pop-ups"
5,2023-11-09 21:04:11,this is the dumbest game since temple run do not get it nor spend the money. i hate how every game now has to have a rainbow flag somewhere in it like leave that crap out not everyone supports that stupid mess,DO NOT GET
2,2023-04-19 08:17:54,"The graphics are great, but don’t like that it says things like, let’s knock down so and so’s landmark- don’t feel bad, how do you think she got so rich? Or let’s steal from so and so’s bank vault. And when you steal it says you won the earnings you stole. Terrible language lacking morals and teaching our kids to cheat, steal , and destroy. Hasbro you can do better than this.",Not feeling the negative messaging
5,2023-10-22 00:52:29,I have not played a game that really excites me in a long time. I love going to the rail road for a bank heist. I have become so addicted to this game. It has been fun. I just wish my friends would accept my invites.,Sooo much fun
3,2023-11-08 20:59:24,The games addicting but we keep the same stickers give us new stickers already and fill the dice every 15 minutes to 30 not every hour by then people are shutting us down or keep targeting us and we can’t even target them,Give us more new stickers and more dice!!

4,2023-11-05 17:08:46,Love the game I just wish it have you more new cards and dice. I will say that the last few days the game has not been giving people the mega heist money when they win. Please fix this issue cause I really do enjoy the game.,Love and Issues
4,2023-11-02 22:03:17,"Game promotions are truly the best, which makes buying properties manageable, because as you progress, things get really expensive!

3,2023-10-31 16:00:42,Every few seconds there are multiple pop ups about spending money and more money you spend the more rewards you get and you can just fly threw the game. That being said someone who is just chillin passing time then the game is fine.,This game is pay to win!
1,2023-10-30 21:28:26,Don’t waste your time and money. Monopoly used to be my favorite game and now the developers have just gotten greedy. I understand the goal is to make money but they have made it impossible to advance in the game even when you do buy their ridiculously priced in-app purchases. I didn’t even participate in the current event because they raised the threshold to complete it. Deleting the app now. I’m done.,Lost a player
2,2023-10-30 01:39:53,This game is fun at first but as you level up it becomes harder. Every update has become harder and events have been difficult to complete without spending cash! If you want to spend money.. this is a game for you! Otherwise I would not bother! I’m disappointed how greedy the company has become.,If you want to spend money!
3,2023-10-27 20:25:39,"Wish some how u could win some type of actual money… percentage back or something. We have to spend actual money and it’s fun.

1,2023-10-24 19:18:25,"This game was great at first, but you find yourself at a halt when you finally start collecting items and progressing.

I get you have to get some profit but still we need more unpaid rolls. Other than that I really like this game!",Pretty good
4,2023-10-22 04:06:50,I think the game should have it so you can trade cards with other people instead of only being able to send cards I feel it would be more helpful :) But overall this is a really fun (but addictive) game!,"Super fun , but"
5,2023-10-09 22:41:30,When I first even thought of downloading I was like “ heck yes”. But I never did. Eventually I saw tick tocks about it. And fell in love.(btw:don’t tell you boyfriend/husband that you fell in love),I could not have wished I did not hit download button

They do it purposely to make you spend WAY TO MUCH MONEY",UGH!
4,2023-10-19 16:48:25,"Good game, but extremely annoying. Every time you run out of dice rolls you get 17 pop ups telling you you’re out of dice and how to get more. News flash….we are ALL aware we are out of dice. If I wanted to buy 50 dice for 70$ I will. Quit reminding me every time.",Annoying
1,2023-10-15 18:41:38,This game is frustrating. Always waiting around for stickers you can’t get. The number of dice per hour is horrible. The ability to trade stickers has turned into a nightmare because most players are scammers. There are so many links promising dice or stickers and they are SCAMS! Sure wish it had been a better play experience. However- like so many- I am walking away.,Boring and frustrating
3,2023-10-12 20:21:24,"Seems like when you get low on dice rolls it’s impossible to build them up. Some people have 20-30 thousand dice but many struggle, and you use the same multiplier.

1,2023-10-03 20:37:30,"The app was good but now it’s not. It’s stealing our progress in events and not giving awards as earned. The current partner game is resetting every time you exit the app. I have lost 1000s in dice. The customer service isn’t just horrible, it’s nonexistent. Further more, customer service promised compensation on other known issues and to date nothing. Apple needs to investigate this because ppl losing money.",The app is crashing and stealing

2,2023-09-28 18:01:14,"These people have no idea how to maintain an application. It often crashes and cannot reload after a basic update. Customer support is nonexistent. There’s no way to contact the developer about problems because they require your Game ID, which you cannot get because the game will not load. How pathetic!",Very buggy and terrible support
2,2023-09-28 17:19:06,I’ve been playing for a while and it normally takes seconds for the game to pop up. Right now I’m checking my internet and my phone and the game is loading like a dialup connection. Not sure if anyone else is having the issue but it’s not my internet or my phone. Technical difficulties on your end?,Game not loading
1,2023-09-27 17:02:10,We are losing interest in the game. At first we had to get one or two gold cards. Then when we started sharing cards (the point of the game) you made more stickers gold (non shareable). After most of spent money to complete our first album. You came out with this new album. Each set have a gold card. Really? The rewards dice (the most important) you lowered. Like please get it together.,We the People!

They stop making an easy way for you to receive dice. The stickers to complete an album (for more dice) is non existent. I have not received a new card in 2 weeks gold or otherwise. Just find another game to play I assure you this will be a waste of time,Greedy Game Developers
2,2023-09-22 15:08:12,It’s starts out fun but jumps fast into not making it accessible to move forward in the game without spending money. They dnt give you the stickers necessary to beat challenges and start making every contest unattainable without spending money. Cost almost a billion to beat the landmarks and they raise your earnings as they raise costs of everything,Gradually losing interest
2,2023-09-19 23:22:18,For the love of all things holy why did they make it even harder to get stickers than they did before. I haven’t gotten a new sticker in days and I’m still trying to complete 1 star albums.   Baking the cake was fun in concept but it’s nearly impossible to get cookies unless you roll by 50 which will deplet your dice and you again can’t collect any cookies.,Stickers

3,2023-09-17 20:48:32,I like this game a lot as it is entertaining but with the dog challenge that just ended it was not fair that I had to get 2500 to get token and lots of people got it at 1600. I was up to 2100 with no dice and no way of getting token. I should have got it at 1600 like the majority of people. I’m thinking of uninstalling if things continue to be so unfair.,Complaint

4,2023-09-11 16:08:54,Super fun game! I feel like it would be a lot better if we were able to communicate with friends to try to get sticker packs filled via trading. Or maybe if we could see what our friends need.,Pretty fun! A few adjustments might be nice
1,2023-09-09 03:28:03,"This game is so rigged. It glitches so much and doesn’t give you what you won, and when you email them, they don’t fix it. It’s basically play to win and ITS A FREE GAME.

2,2023-08-02 16:08:13,You just do the same thing over and over again. Doesn’t seem like there’s any “real” objective to the game besides watching your character just run around the board and then move to the next board and do the same thing.

However, after the recent update, the multipluer gets reset every time you log off, which defeats the purpose of having the multiplier. It's really silly and not thought through at all and takes away the joy of the game.","Love the game, but the latest update resets the multiplier"
4,2023-07-24 04:10:19,I love the game. My whole family is playing. I just wish rolls came faster than an hour. Most game you can get cards/rolls/turns every like 20ish minutes. I wish this was that way. It take all day to get enough rolls to make it worth playing.,Great Game!
5,2023-07-12 18:51:46,I really enjoy the game! My dice have been disappearing the last few days though! It’s hard to figure out how you message customer support. 15k and counting dice disappeared so far 😢,Fun game! Been eating my dice though.
5,2023-07-11 07:52:29,At first I thought it was overrated and a old grandma game that would be gon after a month but getting on it might myself changed my mind lol. It’s really addicting and fun to play especially when I rob people I know🤣,Amazing‼️
5,2023-07-11 02:01:16,"Honestly SO ADDICTING. I can't help myself doing anything I can to get more dice because I can't. Stop. Rolling..... make sure you have more friends than I do tho bc if you invite them all you get MORE DICEEEEE. Seriously, download it and you will see!",Loveeeee
5,2023-07-10 02:34:10,That is all DO NOT spend money on it just a fun little time waster when kids are asleep there’s plenty of ways to earn rolls and keep going you do not need to spend money on this,Great for a time killer
5,2023-07-06 22:44:36,The game is super fun and have no problems loading also you can play against friends and get revenge on the one that my have broken your build lol it’s just fun get it,My personal feelings
4,2023-07-07 02:37:14,I love this game but I gave it 4 stars because during the bug I won some dice and never got them (it was more than what y’all gave us for the bug) then I dislike the fact we only get 5🎲 a hour. That’s ridiculous.,Why I only gave 4 stars
4,2023-07-06 02:04:30,I don’t appreciate the good time I was having them this new cake level came out and my game keep crashing now I feel like I’m having withdrawal symptoms fix it please so I can continue to wreck people property and take their money! Sincerely a real monopoly player,Sad and hurt
3,2023-07-06 20:17:57,"Please fix all of these bugs, I just rolled 50x for 3 rolls and didn’t receive the event point nor rewards. I’ll have to wait until tomorrow to receive more rolls. This is very inconvenient to the people who love this game! Overall awesome game, just please stop putting some much on all for it to come glitching down✌🏾",New Update
4,2023-07-05 20:30:07,"This is a really good game but when I wanted to re-start but it won’t let me play the game and even google works and my other apps that need lost of Wi-Fi and they worked so now I want to play but it won’t let me me, and I just want to play monopoly go.",I really like this game but
4,2023-07-05 19:32:27,I have been playing for awhile built up pretty good and it crashed today and is not working. I’ve troubleshooted every way I could. My phone died during a shutdown and now it’s stuck on that won’t let me finish the shutdown,App crashed.

But when I tried to open all day, it will not go pass 30% Loading… I’m getting irritated because I like the game but this needs to be fixed!!! The update, that was done today made the app worse!!!",After I spent money/updates
1,2023-07-05 20:04:20,I normally do not write reviews but I hope this one is loud and clear I’m ashamed to say I actually spent money on this app and was having a good time until today with the update and not being able to get on I would have happily kept playing but with this recent event y’all lost me with this no I’m sorry here’s some rolls or money for y’all’s screw up I hope y’all keep losing good loyal players because that is messed up screw yall im goin home !!!!,COUNT YOUR DAYS SCOPLY!!

3,2023-07-05 18:51:17,I love this game. I would’ve given a five star but the app keeps getting an error message and then I can’t get back in. I deleted and reinstalled but it only worked about 10 minutes before kicking me out again. Super frustrating after I spent $20 to get extra rolls.,App keeps glitching
5,2023-05-31 15:17:38,I really do not enjoy monopoly the board game lol but I am having a great time with this new mobile version I’d recommend it for anyone looking for a game that doesn’t require purchases to play/enjoy the game,It’s actually fun
1,2023-06-23 18:39:10,I have no idea how this game has any good reviews. I don’t even know how it’s called a game. You really don’t do anything but push a button. Everything else is done automatically you don’t get to choose anything there’s no strategy. The only thing it has in common with monopoly is the same game board and then there are all the pop-ups to purchase more dice rolls. What a waste of time and money if anyone actually pays money.,No skill
4,2023-06-13 18:56:21,"I made a purchase and with in 2 min the prompted there was an error and needed to restart. Now the game will not load past 32% and restart 😔 I have closed the app, restarted my phone, and reinstalled the app. Nothing worked to fix the issue! PLEASE HELP!",Game stopped loading past 32%
3,2023-06-07 06:04:35,"It’s a very addictive game, but the only downside is that the dice refill takes forever just for 6 rolls that’s not enough, 60 + rolls but you only get 6 an hr, by the time is full , your already bankrupt and building are attacked , top of that you have to fix your destroyed property with your own money",Needs a little more work
5,2023-05-30 13:25:33,"It has all nostalgia without the family drama, i play it and always love the fact that it has actual almost game mechanics like the regular monopoly games do, i would recommend to anyone.",This game is so amazing
4,2023-05-30 23:45:24,I love playing monopoly on a real board so much that I am glad there is an option to play digitally. I do wish there was an option to play with other people in between rolls on the board.  This would make the game more interesting. Overall this is a great game!,Awesome game!
5,2023-05-12 23:57:34,I just had spinal surgery so after doing my walking and exercises I get to take medication and relax. I actually enjoy playing this very much. It gives me something to do. I’m very grateful come on everybody let’s Play,Enjoyment
4,2023-05-13 14:28:43,"I got a mega heist with my dice rolling multiplier of 5x. So the heist would be $750,000 for the three rings. But then because it was mega heist and it gave me a whopping x20, it should have been 15 million, but it only showed 5.5 million for the three golden bars. That’s wrong and unfair to say times 20 and it not even be truly x20.",Fun but the math is wrong
5,2023-11-07 11:49:41,It’s a wonderful game even though it’s an illusion. But it shows to be rich we should be really patient for what we earn and expense. Thanks for creating this wonderful app for everyone to enjoy!,Mechanical Designer
4,2023-11-03 00:13:52,"I enjoy Monipoly Fo however even when I purchase rolls I still can’t get a new sticker nor a Golden sticker, WHY?…. And I don’t always get my rewards….big disappointment! I’m so rethinking this game because I spend way too much on it",Where’s my rewards?
4,2023-11-01 17:17:06,Hello I’m trying to make someone aware the app continues to glitch and restart. It won’t allow me to buy off the board without restarting. I would hope this is fixed before the competition ends,Glitching now
1,2023-11-01 22:28:39,Game is literally rigged. You land on spaces all the time until the events come up then magically you never land on them. The game seems to glitch every time an event is going on and you LOSE ton of your stuff and they do not replace it. Customer service doesn’t respond. Do not spend real money it’s not worth it. You’ll just get repeats and not even good ones that you can trade for. Idea of game is great but just isn’t worth it.,Rigged
1,2023-11-01 18:43:54,Lost all my money when someone heisted me after I kept trying to build my properties. I kept getting an error message and my properties would not build. Had to exit the game and then all my money gets stolen this is a joke. I’m so sick of the glitches and losing out on my stuff. I also am tired of people not building and you can’t get revenge. I’m done with this app and the money I spent.,Lost money
3,2023-11-01 17:55:30,"Game keeps crashing. Meanwhile people are able to steal my money knock down my buildings. I’m loosing dice. I realize that sometimes games glitch, but maybe shut it down so those of us who are having glitches don’t loose out when it out of our control.",Keeps crashing
3,2023-11-01 17:31:07,"love the game. but i constantly get the same stickers over and over. even in the 5 star, 3 star, and any gold packs. i literally need one star gold cards to finish sets and i keep getting cards i already have.   i also keep getting low numbers every single time i spin for the car game for halloween. every single time.   everytime i tried to build something, the game crashes and reloads and it continues to do the same thing. i’ve updated it, restarted my phone, closed out the game and reopened it multiple times. please fix it",needs fixing
3,2023-11-01 17:30:54,"It’s a great game that sort of requires you to play daily to make good progress, but it’s so buggy after the update, the game might as well not work.   I’ve tried 5X to upgrade my properties and it keeps telling me there’s an error and the game needs to restart.","Great, but extremely buggy after update"
4,2023-11-01 17:01:59,"Not sure if there was a recent update, but today I keep getting errors and some of my rewards have been taken away. I love playing this game, love the animations of each board, but super annoyed at the cute t situation of errors!!!",Update?
2,2023-11-01 16:55:56,My game has been acting up lately. It cuts off after a minute and says error we have to restart the game. I hit ok then it reloads and then continues to say error after a minute or two. I lose any progress I made. I try to report it to customer service and after I send the report it freezes.,Can’t get ahold of customer service
5,2023-10-31 13:04:03,Love playing this game. The only thing that they should upgrade/change is the availability to get new tokens and shields. I’m on board 57 and only have the original shield and haven’t earned a new token in ages.,Love this game but…
4,2023-11-01 16:49:32,"The update that came out today has made the game unplayable. It gives an error, have to reboot message every 10-15 seconds and keeps restarting the game. Great game to play, just fix the newest patch.",Game is unplayable after latest update
3,2023-11-01 16:36:12,"Again there are issues with the game giving error message and shutting down. When this happens progress is not saved but dice counts are reduced. There isn’t a place to report a problem, the site redirects to articles and known issues.",Buggy
4,2023-11-01 16:24:22,Man…y’all need to patch it up some more…the app always crashes when someone get over a trillion dollars on there and it leaves people take a free shot at my board till it gets back down to a certain amount,Crashes
3,2023-11-01 16:08:27,"I love this game.   What I’m not loving about this game is the most recent update causes it to crash every 30 seconds to minute, which resets me back to where it was prior to the crash.

5,2023-10-28 01:05:44,This game is so fun you can add friends and go to different places. I highly recommend this game it is free and for all ages. You can also add friends from different social medias.  This game is AMAZING and I hope you play it.,5\5 stars
3,2023-10-30 17:28:08,This game was so much fun to play in the beginning but now it’s getting boring and y’all make it hard to get rewarded and don’t give out enough dice and as far stickers we get the same ones over and over only gave 3 stars because of the fact that I like the game,Not fun anymore
1,2023-10-30 00:01:02,"If you want to enjoy the game and everything they have to offer, open up your wallet and spend your savings! The best decision I ever made was taking out a personal loan so I could buy all of the $100 packs they come out with every week so I could get the same duplicate stickers instead of the stickers I need. I’m working on taking out a second loan just to keep on going because it’s so fun!",Money Hungry App

They can keep it, the cards and everything else!",Money Grab!!
3,2023-10-26 00:59:41,Seems the only way you can get completed albums is to spend money. Have went over 3 weeks without any new cards. Each season completing albums give less rolls. Game is starting be a scam. Change the algorithms to balance out better!!!!,Could be better
3,2023-10-24 18:32:30,This game is addicting but there’s no way to win without spending lots of $$$$$$. It’s nearly impossible to get 4 and 5 star stickers unless you buy expensive packs. Play Monopoly Tycoon instead. The AI on this game is designed to make you spend money so don’t even start this game.,Can’t win without spending
5,2023-10-13 22:05:48,My favorite Bored game is monopoly and this monopoly you can take with you anywhere with only your cellphone! It’s fun and has more accessories that real monopoly. You should download it today!! The best part is it’s free! For a good game that’s free this is the best!!!,I love it
3,2023-10-17 05:10:59,"Start the game and get three payments to buy dice. You get close to running out and those three offers appear again. As you level up, items needed show ip less and less. Will delete from phone. Nothing like the real game.",To many ads too but more dice..
3,2023-10-14 17:59:40,For the past few weeks the game has been extremely glitchy: taking hours to load and as of recent not accepting dice links. It comes up to say collect and then it doesn’t add the dice to your board. And pleeeaaasseee do better on the way that stickers are distributed!!,Glitchy
4,2023-10-03 16:05:12,"The game has these weird glitches. Won’t give you all your rolls you’ve earned and will move you back a board. It’s an unfair game. Still fun. However, I have noticed this weird setback on my board. I see you MonopolyGO! And I’m not happy.",Half way satisfied
3,2023-10-07 18:11:00,I give it 3 stars I wanna give it 5 but it takes about 7 hrs just to get 70 dice get your free present is 7 hrs too why so long to get people to buy 🤔another thing fix the glitches slow rolling freezing taking away people dices and prizes and not returning or even acknowledging the problem,Monopoly go
3,2023-10-03 18:02:34,Great game. Really enjoyed it. Once I hit level 43 is issues. It no longer saves. I will make it all the way to 50 and then the next time it reopens it starts me back at board 43. After three times I realized it was no fluke and not worth replaying the same levels over and over,Great game until level 43
3,2023-10-02 04:00:39,"This game is fun, especially if you are competing with friends.  My only gripe is how much it costs to play in game and in real life.

3,2023-09-28 14:23:03,Great game. Extremely slow to open up. Constant errors when loading and playing. Kicks me out during the game and gives me an error. Graphics are good and the game is fun. It just the constant errors loading makes me not want to keep the game.,Great game but too many errors

1,2023-09-21 00:47:21,I really feel this game is hacked. I never seem to get dice or any new sticker cards. It’s ridiculous to be able to collect 15 of a single card. Why not switch it up ?

1,2023-09-19 16:27:33,I use to love monopoly when it first came but as you getting playing more they start to cheat you out of stuff more.

Prices they ask for a small amount of dice is an electric bill😂 trying get stickers is out of the question unless you want numerous duplicate! Can’t trade gold stickers!

They also want you to trade with other people to get what you need but people are greedy and will scam you and/or want money for the specific cards. While it’s a fun game one it’s own the frustration of trying to finish sticker sets kills that fun.,Don’t waste your money.

1,2023-08-28 13:13:55,There is no gameplay here. The only thing you can do is roll dice and have the game play itself. You can literally just tap the dice to progress through the game. There is no strategy and no thought put into it.  The positive reviews for this game are written by AI. None of it is real. It’s scary how long this game has remained at the top of the AppStore despite all the reviews having been faked since launch.,This “game” uses bots to write fake reviews

5,2023-08-25 14:47:19,My game keeps freezing. I once enjoyed playing. It gets aggravating. It takes my stress away but can’t even get through sometimes 😫😫😫 send help,Freezing up
5,2023-08-07 14:17:30,I love this game…it keep my daughter is always trying to compete with me lol I do have a concern tho. When I have a multiplier on and land on Chance I don’t get the payout + the multiplier…is it supposed to multiply my reward?,My childhood and adulthood just fell in love!!
3,2023-08-15 21:01:07,If you have specials where you work as a team to build things then you need to be able to delete the friend if they don’t help you build and be able to add a different friend!  This has cost me on two events. I deleted the game.. it’s set up to wheee you have to buy dice…,Fox the issue
1,2023-08-12 13:32:22,Do NOT play this game.  Good reviews are probably fake. This game is a scam. How you may ask??   I loved the game at first (great concept) but the reality is they don’t give you the proper amount of rolls. 1 example is I was getting all my family and friends to join up for the rolls they never gave me rolls for the last 2 people so I quit telling people to join (I have proof).   Then they make it so hard to obtain sticker that people are LITERALLY scamming other in the FB “Trading group” they do nothing about it.   One guy asked a girl for NUDES for a STICKER. He clearly should not be allowed to play this game with CHILDREN on here. Do you think they care?   Great Concept absolutely terrible execution. Disgusting Scammers go unchecked.,Worst Possible User Experience
2,2023-08-09 17:19:19,Though I love playing. This app cheats. I’ll roll 11 and it’ll move my piece only 10 times. And numerous times I don’t get the reward. Customer service is unavailable/ doesn’t respond. It is very irritating to roll a number and have it cut short by 1. And often not get my reward.   Please fix this. Over hundreds of people have this issue.,This app cheats
5,2023-08-04 21:08:56,On the peg e game the goal For the pink pack stickers was 4600 yesterday ! Today it’s 8000?! Cheating ! Already difficult enough to get 5 star stickers now the finish is misleading and keeps moving further away !,Goal change
1,2023-08-07 02:48:27,"Game can be fun, but there’s 4 pop-ups pushing you downs real money in the game for extra rolls before you can even play. Urges you to use multipliers which burns through your rolls and again makes you need to wait an hour for 5 rolls or spend money to get more. It’s an okay time waster, but could really do without all of the pop ups. I don’t recommend.",So many pop-ups and always wanting money
4,2023-08-02 23:41:27,"Love the game! However, there needs to be a better efficient way we can trade cards. Very confusing using the Facebook group. Many scams when trying to trade. Once this is fixed this could be a super addicting game!",Trading Cards Not Efficient

3,2023-07-31 02:03:56,"Love playing this game with the family but it’s impossible to get new cards. I’ve traded in cards at 100 and 500 and you just get more duplicates.

2,2023-07-27 18:04:44,You’d think when you trade in all your duplicates they’d give you at least one 5 star card or a card that you don’t have. Plus when you finish a board giving you more than 50 rolls! This game got old real quick. Deleting it. Tired of playing it after a week. Can’t even get new cards when I purchase something,Bogus!
4,2023-07-27 14:52:40,They want you to spend money too much. Like I don’t need 4 pop ups every time I go to play. It’s very annoying. Otherwise pretty fun. I like that you can play with randoms and your friends.,Fun game but too many pop ups when you launch app.

1,2023-07-12 20:43:49,The game was great until the game kept glitching on the cake/baking event to where my partners scores were not registering on my game which kept me from finishing. It wasn’t possible for me to finish 4 with no help. I know it wasn’t registering because they showed me their boards and their scores didn’t match mine. I would leave 5 stars if not for that. I thought maybe the devs would have fixed the issue but nothing happened.,Great game!
2,2023-07-11 20:44:48,The game is kinda fun … but the fact that people that aren’t on my friends list rob me For half of my worth and I never get the same opportunity enrages me. I only get to “heist” my friends list. I’ve never ended up on a strangers board to do a heist. Technically there should be a way to protect at least a portion of your cash.  I deleted the game that feels like a ploy to make me buy things.,Big No

1,2023-11-04 14:25:07,"It seems like the game on different aspects rigged the game to provoke you to play more. For example, the building events, when you spin the wheel, it’s extremely difficult land on a yellow portion, the dial purposefully avoids it, but on the last day, you can land on it easily. This is done intentionally. When it comes to earning dice, it’s real difficult especially if you are low on dice. This game is addicting and rigged. Stay away",Rigged

I’ve never seen such a greedy game company. Way to make a game not fun losers.,Game could be fun if the company wasn’t terrible
5,2023-09-04 10:28:16,I love it you can play with your friends and bff and you can play with your siblings but 1 thing you have to pay so much and people can rec your homes and that stel the money but it is the beast ❤️‍🩹🤗🤗  From. Abigail,I love it
1,2023-09-08 10:34:45,"The game use to be fun before the creators decided to get greedy with making money. People spend money on the game anyways, but they’re making it to where everyone has to spend money.

1,2023-09-04 12:40:22,"The game initially was really fun, almost addictive. Then after a fresh album was introduced they changed the algorithms up and it’s virtually impossible to get any dice to roll. Definitely set up to make you spend money on.

3,2023-09-01 01:30:58,Love the game but won’t be playing anymore due to the fact the only way to win the sticker game is to buy stickers in the end due to the fact you can’t trade in the end and it’s impossible to get them any other way. I won’t play where I have to pay.,Monopoly go
3,2023-09-01 01:09:25,"The game itself is decent not real demanding and no matter what others are saying, it is not pay to play.

5,2023-10-05 00:52:33,I love monopoly it is a fun game you can get your son level really fast so my opinion you should always buy monopoly and it’s very fun and don’t play too much because it’s very addicting,About monopoly
5,2023-10-03 14:22:59,I keep having to close and open the game today. It’s loading slow and it’s not giving me the rewards. I’m earning. Please fix this glitch!,Glitching
3,2023-10-03 20:19:09,I lost all my progress. The game is fun and I have been playing for a long time but the support team will not get back to me. Especially because the toy event is on right now and I can’t help my partners. I lost everything. I even had in game purchases. Support team has not got back to me at all.,LOST ALL MY PROGRESS
5,2023-10-02 02:05:05,This game is so much fun! I play it everyday.🤩 I wish there was a way to request cards from your friend list without having to connect to facebook 😩,Obsessed!!
4,2023-10-02 16:48:40,We should do more team games like this all the time and I think you should up the dices once we get on new boards maybe’s like 150 dices  different ways to get different times of shields,Nothing bad to say at all
5,2023-09-28 13:55:39,Recently been having issues with it loading up but overall I really enjoy the game ❤️,Overall
1,2023-10-01 13:11:22,"This game is easily the most frustrating game I play. I’ve actually stop playing as much as I have because I see that the owner of this game is just money hungry. The point of the game is to play and win but now it’s more of a pay to play and win. If you don’t spend $100+ in the game, you most certainly will not win. So Unless you want to spend your whole paycheck, don’t download this game.",Don’t do it.

4,2023-09-28 15:36:54,I have not been able to open app since last night. It loads to 51% then error message pops up. I know my landmarks are damaged. Please fix and stop giving low amounts of dice and the same stickers.,Not working

5,2023-09-24 16:32:24,It is sooo fun playing but it is a little hard collecting tokens and each Time you get a new board the places cost a lot but I would recommend playing it i love it,Monopoly
4,2023-09-28 13:22:50,Listen .. I’ve had my fair share of games to play but this one .. it’s awesome hands down .. when they made this game they took their time .. even down to the sounds and colors. I love it .. just play it for yourself to find out.,Amazing game

2,2023-09-28 03:22:37,A couple problems is you get nothing but duplicate stickers. I’ve been playing for a couple weeks with my family and they have gotten good stickers and closed packs. I’ve closed a few but not many. Also when you complete a build out you only get 50 dice not enough to do anything.,Stickers
1,2023-09-28 00:26:34,The game used to be fun now it’s just a way to get you to spend money. Played almost 3 week in last round needing 1 sticker to complete all cards. Bought dice packages and never received…all duplicates. This round I’ve had six card waiting on 1 gold since it started. Bought packages and even came in1st in tournament. Everything received is duplicates. I’m not gong to keep dumping money in this game😔,Don’t like it anymore
3,2023-09-27 15:00:34,"Love the game! Only issue I have is there should be more opportunities to earn dice. You can use the monopoly money that you earn to build landmarks but there should be an option to purchase dice as well. Instead of spending money each time I run out, I just hop on another game.",Love the game…. except…
5,2023-09-19 12:02:55,"I think you guys should fix the dice problem, I run out of dice so fast and it’s so frustrating when you’re tryna do something and you run out dice and can’t finish an event.",Love it but..
1,2023-09-19 16:52:41,"I love to play the game, but the more and more I play I can tell it’s rigged for people to lose and spend money. I went through 800 dice to land on a utility, and only landed on it maybe a good 5 times. I only needed 100 points to when the game. You do the math. 800 dice to get 100 points and still didn’t get it.  Soon as that game ended, I landed on it every roll Smdh! So beware this game is more about spending money then actually having fun. 👎🏻",Beware
3,2023-09-14 06:49:55,"it’s a very fun and addicting game, i find myself playing it constantly throughout the day and i’ve spent a little bit of money here and there for dice and sticker packs. but recently my game has been pretty glitchy. it starts freezing while i’m trying to roll my dice or it freezes while my piece is going to a new spot in the board. i’ve had times where i’m getting my reward from completely daily challenges or the events and the game freezes, i’ve started playing less since this started as i’m afraid to lose my rewards","love the game, but…"
5,2023-09-07 00:32:52,I love this game so much. I just wish they had an in game chat room to talk to your friends to trade stickers. I’ve just about given up on the Facebook group.,Highly recommend this game!
3,2023-09-13 21:29:05,Sad when you are getting somewhere in the game and overnight fake/bot accounts still more than half your money or leave you bankrupt in a bank heist that is supposed to be only available to your friends!!  Game is decent other than that,Disappointing
1,2023-09-13 19:44:24,I absolutely loved this game. Got a ton of friends hooked but now the makers are just money hungry. You can’t finish anything without spending your own money. There’s way to many people scamming to get cards cause the 4-5 star cards are rare and they’ve ruined it for everyone. I’ve spent so much money on this game and I can’t afford it anymore. A free game shouldn’t cost so much to just finish! I will be deleting this game,Don’t bother
3,2023-09-13 04:07:30,Can only your friend Rob you in a heist? Because I’m trying to build the money and then some random person keeps stealing it. They aren’t my friends and I didn’t know ransoms can rob you. It kinda feels like a scam the game runs to make you have to do the work and spend more real money.,How do heist work?
2,2023-09-11 21:04:28,"The game is for sure addictive but I don’t like how when you complain to customer service, don’t nothing happen. I have been missing so much dice that I am suppose to be winning but never receive and when the cake challenge was happening I was missing out on so many cookies I landed on. I keep getting repeatedly the same stickers 😒",Upsetting
1,2023-09-08 09:48:18,And the game stalls  They give you 15 min mega heist and never allow you to land on it  The game stalls at every roll so the time will run out before you can roll During the 15 min mega heist you only land on shut downs as soon as it is over it gives you a regular heist  They give too many multiple stickers including gold that you can’t change  Right now I have over 500 multiple stickers and 149 in the sets  Gold are the most difficult to get but they realize they can try get you to buy them so they won’t give them to you  One thing they definitely put a lot of thought into making money off of this popular board game that everyone loves,False advertising
2,2023-09-08 00:12:40,"it was alright but could be better, is fun when your rich. It’s pretty much a loop of building more towns and making money to upgrade and the upgrades get bigger. So they cost more, which means more rolling the dice and waiting, and waiting for money. It just takes up storage that I could use for pictures or apps that are actually fun",Monopoly Go Moblie
1,2023-09-07 22:12:16,this game use to be so much fun and now the game glitches so much you lose all your stuff 🙄 and good luck hearing back from support and if you do you get a measly few dice and some money. yeah the game is pay to play but man it use to actually be fun to play without spending STUPID amounts of money. and now it’s impossible to win and finish things without paying. i’m done back to candy crush i go 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻,this game use to be fun
5,2023-09-02 06:04:56,I love the game. I do wish they had a chance card that gave you unlimited dice for an hour or something. A different way to get album cards too.,Update
1,2023-09-06 15:48:13,I got all the way to board 140 and my game was deleted. Customer service won’t even reply to messages to fix the issue. I started the game completely over because I enjoy playing it. Now when friends send me sticker none of them are coming through. Customer service won’t reply to messages about this issue either.,Poor customer service.
2,2023-09-06 15:16:34,I have purchased a few offer and only received half or bare minimum of my orders. This is beginning to become very frustrating for someone who enjoys playing MonopolyGO with friends. Even when they say it’s fixed it still does the same thing I tried customer service and everything.,NOT RECEIVING ALL OF MY Purchased offers
5,2023-08-31 14:37:50,I love the game the only thing is that you can maybe add a search to search people and maybe you can add a thing where you can play with your friend on the game,Good and bad
4,2023-09-01 21:43:05,"This is a really fun twist on Monopoly, very enjoyable! My only issue is I just completed a board and appear to have lost rolls instead of earning 50. Would report this some other way but can’t seem to find a way to contact Scopely about it.",Great fun!!

3,2023-08-27 15:01:16,I think I’m the next update y’all should allow us to trade gold stickers as well at least one per day or something cause why we got all these extras and can’t do nothing with them but wait to finish the sets it’s pointless to give extra gold stickers,Trade gold stickers

Told me they’re aware of the problem and that’s it. But what about my money??? This is unacceptable. Apple said this is not eligible for a refund.

3,2023-08-25 16:34:24,The game is a lot of fun and u enjoy playing it. I tried to make a couple of purchases and never received my purchases but my card was charged. This wasn’t a problem until recently. Hopefully the game fixes soon.,Fun but watch out making purchases.

3,2023-08-24 05:17:55,The game is fun but it has major downfalls. They want you to pay ridiculous amounts to get any advancements. You can only trade 5 stickers in 24 hrs. Then there is the probability of receiving the stickers you need in the events (slim to none). Not being able to trade gold stickers is ridiculous.,Fun but ridiculous
2,2023-08-25 01:42:54,"Been playing this for a while now. Have even spent money on it. And yet no matter what I can’t get a new card to complete a set, it gets frustrating because all these apps what you to spend money, but don’t  want to give you anything. No new cards. Unless you go on Facebook and trade.. I am not doing that.","Fun Game, But There greedy with cards"

2,2023-10-23 19:42:32,"A good majority of when errors occur nothing ever comes from it, there are times I’ll hit collect for the free 25 dice and it’ll never be added to my actual amount of dice I can roll. The further you get the more frustrating it is and I’m just about ready to delete this game . Used to be fun now it’s more like 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼",Not sure why it goes downhill fast
1,2023-10-23 00:11:24,At first I thought it was something I was doing wrong. Until I seen posts from others about not getting correct rewards for mini games. I’ve been cheated out of dice and money. As well as rewards. The games fun but not reasonably priced for buying things. I’ve finished several (over 4) tournaments and not gotten the correct rewards for them. It’s frustrating.,Not getting rewards
1,2023-10-22 18:46:00,"This game constantly “glitches” and makes you lose progress and awards. They have also stopped giving notifications for free dice on their menu “shop” section. They also stopped distributing dice on their Instagram application which they would give daily. When you purchase dice, they never land on any awards all the stickers they give you are duplicates. This game is ridiculous and a scam!",Scam
5,2023-10-13 22:55:45,I just downloaded this about 1 day ago and I have been nonstop playing this. I think this is a well built game and I like how the different boards are from around the world🌎! MUST HAVE!!!!!!,So good!!
5,2023-10-10 11:36:37,Love that you can connect with family and friends and you don’t have to buy it if you don’t want it using real cash,Easy game to play
5,2023-10-10 01:15:47,"We shouldn’t be getting gold dups! If they’re ineligible for trade and sharing. Also, the spin wheel safe box with the glittery background, what’s the point when it’s nothing but 1 star dups in it every single time",DUPLICATE GOLD STICKERS
4,2023-10-04 15:10:26,The game is a lot of fun. I like to play with family and friends with events and attack each others boards. But I’ve been having the game eat the dice and money. Which means I’m not getting any one it especially for jail breaks.,.
2,2023-10-09 23:47:50,"I thought the gameplay would be similar to the physical shorter Monopoly games available (like Monopoly Deal and Diced). It’s not at all. The concept is roll dice to collect money and click buttons to build monuments in a city. It reminds me of a slot machine more than anything and it mindless, requiring absolutely no thoughts, real decision making, and no strategy. Not for me.",Nothing New
2,2023-10-06 12:24:58,I tried to make a in-app purchase for two different packages. My purchase was declined but I was still charged. I was forced to pay the amount by Apple. I did not even receive the packages that I paid for. I am also frustrated by them not replenishing my dice rolls every hour. This app/company is ripping people off.,Give my money or what I paid for
2,2023-10-05 01:59:11,"I started out enjoying this game. As I played monopoly go, I noticed the game cheats us out our money. It is rigged to collect money with no results. It is hard to get gold cards, 5 and 4 star cards, and the same cards are won and repeated. The boards you play starts over and over as you complete them. I think I’m done with the game.",Scopely is not right
4,2023-10-04 01:08:04,"My main complaint about the game is that it is very seldom that you get new cards once you get to a certain point… and it’s usually the golden cards, ones that can’t be exchanged, that you hardly ever get.",New Stickers
1,2023-10-01 11:46:06,The game was great in the beginning but once you get over level 100 it’s too hard to progress because the little amounts of dice the game allows doesn’t cut it anymore. So you play for days just to upgrade 1 landmark. On top of that. The Gold cards are scarce to NONE and when you do finally get one it’s a dupe. The game makes to nearly impossible to win and that is ridiculous.,No fun anymore.
5,2023-09-28 19:42:35,I love this game for when I’m bored but the only problem is the ads every time I open the app and every time I run out of rolls! 4 stars overall.,Great game but only problem is….
1,2023-09-28 20:51:10,I can not stand that this app even with updates goes hours without being able to sign on and then every time it is down when I get back in all my stuff is destroyed and I have to waste dice and money in the game to get it back up and going when if it had been working it wouldn’t have been that bad. About to just delete and forget about it!,Rip off
2,2023-09-28 19:58:32,"Unless you put hundreds of your money on this game you will not have fun at all. Stickers are so hard to get, only 8 dice per hour, golden stickers that can’t be share and you get multiple of repeated stickers. Everybody end up needing the same card that you will be only able to get if you pay for it.",Frustrating game
3,2023-09-28 19:46:04,"When you roll the dice the thing shorts you out of a move. If you roll 10 it will stop on 9.   I am also having trouble getting the app to load, it says that I am not connected to WiFi, when in fact I am. Please fix this, I enjoy playing the game.",Dice shortage

4,2023-09-28 18:33:17,Game now won’t load today. The opening load screen won’t get to 100% then give error and reboots . I have full service so internet is not the issue. Please fix ASAP,Game won’t load. Says internet issue
1,2023-09-28 17:16:46,I’d give the game 5 stars because of how good it is but now it is no longer playable. I have good Wi-Fi yet it stops at 30% and tells me that there is no internet connection available. I closed app and tested it with other games and apps and my internet works perfectly fine. I’m still getting notifications about my landmarks being damaged or my money being stolen but it’s not letting me play.,Unplayable
4,2023-09-28 13:36:51,Mine keeps telling me there is an error and it has to restart but doesn’t work. Tried to write a issue report but it won’t let me since I haven’t purchased anything,Some issues

But now, all of a sudden it’s been crashing every few minutes. I can’t even get the game to turn on. I updated it and all that jazz… and now it’s just a waste of space.   Suggestion: do not download. Not worth it. Go play something else.",Crashing
1,2023-09-27 03:38:35,"It’s a scam. If you don’t spend actual money, you don’t get anywhere. They give you duplicate stickers so the big win is unreachable. You can’t trade gold cards which you never get in the packs. The max dice you can earn (without winning events and finishing sticker decks) is 80 which is insane because when you get farther in the game, you can’t do ANYTHING with 80 dice on a x5 multiplier.",You have to pay to win.
5,2023-09-12 15:57:11,I love monopoly go i think it’s so fun. It’s really addicting once i start i cant stop until i run out of rolls. The only thing is you barely get any rolls. Like 8 rolls an hour?!?? be real that won’t do anything.,I love it!
1,2023-09-20 14:44:28,The game was fun at first but now the golf packs are only dupes they added shield covers for what? When everyone is saying stuff about how we only get 8 rolls and hour and only 50 from completing a board. Like I said it was fun at first but I WILL NOT BE paying 100$ for a gold guarantee. “This album will be easier” only if you spend money and if you ask me that’s so stupid it’s a free game why would I pay for stuff on it???,Banana
3,2023-09-17 11:20:18,This round it’s almost impossible to get any gold stickers which is a bummer because then there’s no point to trade since you can’t trade gold cards and cannot seem to get them in the game either. And of course you need them to complete any set.,Few Gold Cards
4,2023-09-16 13:21:13,The gold star stickers shouldn’t be so hard to get because people can’t close out a set unless they get the gold sticker. You should be able to trade at least one gold star sticker though out the game.,Stickers
4,2023-09-13 19:00:30,Please remove the feature once we get low on dice that says buy and share. That’s annoying to see that every-time when we run after dice. Other than I love the game. I play it everyday.,Please read
4,2023-09-12 23:25:32,Talk about addictive? My boyfriend made me download this and considering how much I hate him I didn’t want to because I knew he was just using me for more points. So I downloaded it just to get better than him at it. And sure enough. I did.,Just wow
4,2023-09-12 15:42:17,There definitely needs to be new boards! it does start getting very old after get so high up you just repeat the same boards for a more expensive price😒 it’s getting boring because of that.,NEW BOARDS!!!
4,2023-09-08 01:02:54,I don’t like when I exit the game people and take my all money. I don’t think that everyone who is playing continuously play the game 24/7. There should be a lock down when you leave the game,Leaving the game
2,2023-09-08 16:45:31,Yesterday and today when I land on the cookies the game glitches and I am unable to collect my cookies for the baking event. I’ve reported this numerous times to scopely in the game chat and nothing. Just talked to the bot on the app with no results. Looking on Facebook I am not the only one that this is happening to and I am very disappointed.,Cookie glitch has me madder than a worm on a fish line
3,2023-09-08 04:08:36,I have played this game awhile now but now I barely play due to Monopoly Go just being money hungry! The game makes it dang near impossible to do anything other than getting aggravated! Change your ways Monopoly Go or your going keep getting bad reviews and lose players!!,One star reason!
5,2023-08-27 07:39:19,i'm not even a gamer type of girl but honeyyyy this game will have you playing all day and dont let you be out of dice you gone keep coming back checking the game its a coo came ! no sponsorship lol download it,TIME PASSER!!
1,2023-09-06 12:31:39,I’ve spent a lot of money and time on this game and when the new album came out I gathered over 100 new cards including 5 stars and golds! Then my game suddenly restarted and all my cards were gone! I’ve been trying to get in contact for almost a week now with no luck!   It’s not just about the cards lost but the dice I lost to get those cards! Tens of thousands gone!,Game glitched and took all my cards!
1,2023-09-05 16:58:19,"I have been overcharged 2 different times when purchasing packs on this game, and haven’t received any sort of response through their customer service chat bot 😤 Seems almost impossible to speak to a real person when you have any sort of issue. Be very careful when buying anything through this app, and always check your statements",Frustrated
4,2023-09-05 14:29:39,"This game is really fun, my only issue is when i win like 50 shields 2 people attack me and they’re all gone and my buildings need fixed, also my rolls will say i move like 8 spots and it’ll only move like 5 or something random lol",confused lol but it’s fun
3,2023-09-05 00:57:24,Fun and  addicting game while you have dice but way too hard to get them. Completing boards should have bigger rewards the higher you get! Also more for completing sticker sets especially with a gold in each set and less duplicate stickers!,Wish I could play more!
1,2023-09-04 12:41:17,"Game is cool until you run into game issues that can’t be resolved by the player, this makes the experience pretty trash finding I can’t complaint or get help with the many problems and bugs this game has , I wish I could give you guys no stars for that fact that I wasted my time writing this",No customer service or anything to fix or report bugs
4,2023-09-02 09:17:34,Love the game my only feedback is that when you have a multiplier on and pick a card it does not actually use the multiplier in rewarding the prize despite the multiplier appears at the bottom of the card.,Almost perfect
3,2023-08-31 22:29:18,"But you don’t get many dice - if you have none to start with takes 12 hours for my “bar” to be filled. You can only trade 5 stickers a day. If we could get more dice in fewer hours, trade more stickers, or even use Monopoly money to buy dice it would be way more fun and exciting",Addicting
2,2023-08-30 11:41:26,"You can only get so far on this game without having to pay money. The big event to get thousands of dice? I’ve opened many many sticker packs and not gotten the one gold card I need to complete it, so after the event is over; I’m deleting this game. I won’t spend money on a game that’s for fun and also lacks customer service.",Addictive BUT Useless
1,2023-08-27 16:58:26,I purchased an in game pack and did not receive it. Thinking it didn’t actually go through I tried the purchase again and again nothing. Checked my bank account it came out twice. I have messaged and messaged the customer support and still no resolution and barely a response. 🙄 I love playing this game but this has put a horrible taste in my mouth about continuing on,Purchases
2,2023-08-27 14:53:10,"I’m on board 135 and the most annoying thing is trading cards. The game needs a system within the game to trade cards and not Facebook. Also it’s dumb that you can’t trade gold cards, yet will receive multiple. Then when you trade in your duplicates you just receive more duplicates. It’s definitely a money grabber.",It could be better
5,2023-08-27 00:21:39,Fun to play  while  u are bored or have nothing to do. U can play  with friends and attack  them and steal  money. You use money  to level up and u wait a hour to get 5 more dice,Good  app
2,2023-08-27 04:11:03,"This game is fun and a great way to pass the time. However, like other reviews have mentioned having to wait an hour for dice and repeatedly getting duplicate stickers is why I gave it 2 stars.

5,2023-08-24 03:09:47,"I have a blast in some of my spare time playing this game. It is challenging and some of my friends have a blast and are quite competitive, which makes it more enjoyable.",Really fun
3,2023-08-26 03:23:13,"I honestly love this game don’t get me wrong, but it’s absolutely so difficult to get 4 star or 5 star stickers to complete the album. Even after trading in cards or even paying to get sticker packs I still get the exact same stickers I already had! It’s really frustrating!",Love the game.. but..
3,2023-08-24 03:59:07,Monopoly Go needs to do away with Gold stickers if they aren’t going to be tradable. You compete in daily competitions only to get awarded with gold 5 star cards you already have and can’t do anything with outside of putting it in a predetermined vault . Fix this and the game would be a 5 star.,Game is fun with exceptions
5,2023-08-22 23:51:33,We need more sticker sends! And the gold card trade restrictions are insane as it’s already so hard to get the normal ones! Otherwise the game is amazing and I love it two much the whole fam plays!,"Amazing, BUT"

2,2023-08-21 14:05:29,"Game freezes, lags and reboot too much! It restarted the quick play when I had 2 days remaining to get the purple pack and would had received on the next play.

In 43 days I have gotten numerous pink packs and won numerous challenges and I have yet to get either of these 2 stickers, one of them being a 4 star.

4,2023-05-21 09:22:46,"I really do like this game but I wish I didn’t have to wait just an hour for 5 rolls. If I want to get all 50 dice/rolls that’s 10 hours before I can play again. I also think I’d there was mini games within it, that would be cool",I like it but…
4,2023-04-13 22:41:30,"Very entertaining game, but wish there were ads in the app. Having ads to watch and receive more dice would keep me playing! Otherwise I need to stop playing every few hours once I run out of dice rolls.",A new twist to a classic game
2,2023-04-25 01:27:44,you got more dice rolls and not only 5 every hour. It literally takes like seconds to run out of rolls and I refuse to spend money on more The amount of time it takes to run out of rolls you’d be spending a crazy amount of $ for more. It’s absolutely ridiculous and I’ll get bored with it soon enough and end up deleting the app.,Would be worth it if…
5,2023-04-12 04:43:59,"I do enjoy this game, it took me a second to get at first because it’s slightly different than the traditional one, but it’s exactly like the ad! And it’s enjoyable when you catch on!",Monopoly
5,2023-11-09 22:25:55,"I love the game, but been scammed trading stickers too often. There’s gotta be a way that you can have like an escrow in the app so that both sides know that they’re getting what they agreed to trade.",Make safe way to TRADE

4,2023-11-08 13:12:31,It is way too easy to hide friends and then you can unhide them later if you hide them by mistake. The rest of the game is great so far but i’ve hidden a few of my friends and i can’t add them again.,hiding

We also receive repetitive stickers, we don’t get enough options for gold stickers or 4 & 5 star. It’s making it hard to ever win and that’s quiet unfair.

4,2023-11-02 15:19:01,Love this game and enjoy playing with friends. Odd how ALL of us are missing the SAME stickers!  A few friends said the game was rigged and left the game.  The fun of it is playing with friends and trading cards. Wish it was more diverse.,Stickers just aren’t right.

The boys that are in the game will be able to shut down and steal everything from you but you can’t play the game. My friends and I ALL have this happen, every event.

1,2023-10-29 12:34:23,"I have to reasons it’s unfair, 1. I never get any cards that are new I always get old cards but when I’m next to someone they always get new cards in packs, and second people won’t stop attacking me for no reason and they get a lot of dice and I play more than them and they get way more dice. Also one thing you could do is make it so we can change who we are bank heisting.",Unfair
1,2023-10-27 16:35:06,"Starting out is ok, but it only gets worse from there.  The events have gotten way too difficult - now they require 80k for the partner events when it used to be 60k. Unless you’re hardcore on the game constantly or getting carried, you will not make that much progress.  Secondly, it’s not random. You get a predetermined set of numbers that most of the time is bad. I rolled x1 multiplier 500 times and only landed on the corner tiles 4 times when the corner tiles are the current event tile. Are you kidding me?? At least make it so that the non random rolls are balanced and not some money hogging cash grab.  Terrible game, will only save to play with friends if they ask.",Dumpster Fire Cash Grab.
5,2023-10-14 19:06:25,There are no problems with this game other than how you advertise it. You make the game hard when in reality it is easy.,No Problem
2,2023-10-25 19:17:40,The safe are scams at this point. You get 3 sticker packs for 2500 stickers and only one sticker is new. Like what was the point. I still need stickers and no longer have stickers to trade because the safe gave me nothing. I think after this album I will not play as much because this is ridiculous,The safe for the Albums are scams
2,2023-10-25 16:58:24,"Very Expensive game, can’t believe Hasbro has its name on it.  Hasbro always made me think of games playing with the family, now with scopely all I think about is the people spending their whole paychecks on this game.  I guess now its breaking up families.  Also bugs, no matter what you say they don’t fix or respond.",Hasbro not family oriented anymore
3,2023-10-25 04:49:45,Although I love to play the game I play with my cousins and friends we get a kick out of it and have our very own trading group. I received 3 different new gold cards and they did not reflect in my game. Very upsetting I would like to receive some type of reconciliation for this.,Gold cards
1,2023-10-23 11:49:44,Great concept of a game of it wasn’t such a “pay to have a good time” Throwing $50-$100 “deals” in your face every time you open the app. Just make the game playable without having to spend a fortune to enjoy it. If you enjoy a very slow pace game and don’t mind saving up dice for about a week doing the daily quick wins and daily prizes you might enjoy this game. Definitely not for me,Pay to win
3,2023-10-22 01:25:32,Fun game very exciting but having to buy dice just to keep rolling is ridiculous. Yes you can win some but not enough! Takes way too long and once you get dice it goes very fast. Maybe they will change things up in the future hopefully.,Fun but Frustrating
1,2023-10-16 14:28:09,"Everything is over priced and stickers shouldn’t be this hard to get, if I completed a set why am I still getting the same one star stickers? Game needs some real updating. Waiting an hour for dice to reload is stupid when it’s only 8 dice.. hour wait on dice reload should be the whole entire amount. Completing tasks to upgrade things is ridiculous as well",Terrible
5,2023-10-13 06:30:20,I used to play the board game with my family when they would come here from different states but now I get to play with them online!!!!! I highly recommend this game!,VERY FUN I RECOMMEND
1,2023-10-14 05:53:49,Game maker is greedy!! They make it impossible to play and enjoy the game without having to spend real $$.. and the prices are outrageous. This last update made it impossible to earn free dice by inviting new people to play the game. Totally rigged and unfair. I hope they know there is a whole community on social media outraged and ready to stop playing this game unless something changes!,The makers of this game are just greedy!!
5,2023-10-09 22:32:00,It’s a good game but it needs to be fixed I tried getting on and all it keeps doing to me Is freezing I lost my 2nd place and the tournament because of it,Please fix it
5,2023-10-06 18:51:57,I love this game. I never realized how your competitive I was until I unlocked my other Facebook friends. The games changed so much that you will play for hours,Monopoly

4,2023-10-04 10:12:58,7 rolls a hour is over kill. that isn’t a reasonable amount of rolls to even wait for. don’t get me wrong the app is very fun but i feel you guys should at least give more free rolls if we have to wait an hour.,Only 7 rolls and hour!🥴

Go big or go home 💀",Error
1,2023-10-03 17:04:26,countless money hungry ads pop up every five seconds which is honestly just sad. Game has you beat boards just to be pulled back cause there servers are anything but decent so you’ll get 30-40 minutes of progress just to have to do the same thing all over again when the game loads you back. Honestly not even worth playing anymore,Game is anything but polished
1,2023-09-30 14:38:23,"This game is a joke.. you need dice to play you give 8 dice an hour. That don’t do anything and when you do get lucky with some dice you make it impossible to play.

3,2023-09-28 08:23:55,"The game is pretty fun and I enjoy playing it, but constantly having the game crash and saying it needs to restart is very annoying. If they fix that problem then it would get 5/5 stars instead of 3",Could be better if fixed

It’s impossible to get other cards if they only thing you give us is those same cards … what about gold cards or even dice to play … The higher the board the more money so why give only 50 dice when the boards are tripled as you get further in the game … it’s not fair,These cards

1,2023-11-09 23:54:50,It’s sad when you can’t afford to buy dice but have to wait an whole hour for say if i have max 80 rolls and you only get 8 rolls an hour. It should be 50 dice an hour or something. Even with the free gifts have to wait an hour. I miss out on so many special items cause my rolls are empty.

4,2023-10-22 14:56:11,I play this to breakup boredom and to shut my brain down before bed.  Compared to the Yahtzee game this is much better.  If Scopely would change Yahtzee to be more basic like this it would be so much better.  This fills the void and is fun.,Passes the boredom
2,2023-10-21 22:26:28,I love this game but it is getting so hard to get the 4* and 5* stickers without paying an arm and a leg. It is becoming apparent that this is all about getting rich quick.

1,2023-10-03 17:37:21,This game is fun however it cheats you drastically at times when you roll the dice the token doesn’t move the appropriate spaces that correwith the number thrown on the dice.

4,2023-08-19 23:12:40,I love the game couldn’t be more addicting to something Lol but When will we be able to start gifting the gold cards ? It’s hard to get cards you need and we get extras of the gold ones but can’t send them,Gifting stickers

1,2023-08-15 09:59:29,"I don’t ever drop reviews honestly but this one got me fuming. This is the SECOND time y’all let sum random FB account take ALL OF MY MONEY from a bank heist and bankrupt me, that’s not fair at all like how is this even happening? I’m done with this game. There is no way for me to progress when u have a bot account coming thru like a thief in the night and take all my earnings, and it’s happen in the middle of the night both times",RIGGED ACCOUNTS
2,2023-08-14 09:31:04,I played for 2 weeks they take extra dice unnecessarily 1 roll somehow equals 3 dice I managed to get my bank to $16 mill and someone was able to completely steal the whole thing it’s really not worth playing it’s fun but there’s things that should definitely be fixed! It’s truly not worth wasting ur time just pull out the monopoly board,Extreme waste of time!
4,2023-08-13 18:47:10,"I love Monopoly Go but, it would be way better. If you could add another version to where in the game you can just play regular monopoly, the same rules and with people or even robots on the game that’s just my opinion you do you!",I love it but…

1,2023-08-01 16:02:52,They make it so you HAVE to spend money to win the game. You can trade cards to try and complete it but they aren’t releasing the cards needed to trade and have cards you can’t trade and have to try and collect that they also aren’t releasing. Been playing for a month and have not gotten new cards in 2 weeks. Also so hard to complete or do good in the challenges.,Game is good but impossible to win
4,2023-07-30 16:53:27,"I love this game I just wish that it would allow you to get more rolls in less time every hour it’s just ridiculous also, I think the free prize should be every six hours instead of every eight hours.",Love it

2,2023-07-17 22:40:34,I like playing the game! But now I am getting annoyed cause I keep on getting the same card over and over again.  And also I wish we could trade gold cards and wish there was like an event were we can grab as many stickers (gold) as we can. If you could let us trade gold cards for one day that would be nice 👍,❤️
5,2023-07-13 18:58:09,Round the rocks the ragged rascal runs.   I’ve never made so much fake money in my life. In a mere 13 seconds I made over 300k in Monopoly money.   I forgot to brush my teeth and I haven’t stood up from the toilet.,Never be board…again!

4,2023-07-10 12:59:22,I personally love this so far. But I do think the higher up the level you should get more dice then just 50. And color wheel should also add more stuff each higher level. Other than that I’m hooked. Thanks,Winner
5,2023-07-07 03:36:49,I love monopoly go because I got lots of money and finished two boards in one day I’m on London now and the more money I spend the more money I get so you should share it two everyone🤩🤩🤩,I love Monopoly go comment
5,2023-06-26 11:51:56,Very fun game.. just wish it was more ways to win dice and not sure the purpose of the stickers bc the stars could be obstinate by actually buying the properties you land on but I’m enjoying it non the less.,Fun
2,2023-07-06 05:12:11,Was really enjoying the game but now it’s frozen and no matter what I do it won’t work. I open the app and it goes straight into the hit on another player and then it freezes. I can’t get out of it. I’ve closed the app and restarted my phone and neither help. If I have to delete and lose my levels then I won’t be redownloading,Frozen

5,2023-05-13 03:36:28,This is one of those games that pulls you into paying for things because it’s so addicting.  But they also have ways for you to get free stuff by trading “cards”.   So that’s pretty cool.,It’s addicting

2,2023-10-30 02:07:32,The Halloween car event they held they made impossible to win. You are able to have four separate partners to build a car but they made it impossible to complete one car. Also the stickers you keep getting the same stickers over and over.,Impossible to win

2,2023-09-26 13:04:45,I’ve had so many issues with my game since the last update that were not a problem before.  #1 landing on a mega heist and it changes to a regular heist. #2 Landing on a wheel boost and then my game closes out.  #3 Getting cards and it doesn’t show me if they’re new or duplicates.

5,2023-09-17 01:39:30,Every time I have dice it’s a low amount like I wish they made those disappear the amount of times I can roll it’s fun but pls fix it,One problem

It was fun while it lasted",It was a good game
2,2023-09-22 18:29:04,I love the game but now that I’m at the higher levels I feel like they are cheating me . They give crappy daily gifts and give you the SAME cards over and over ! The only my time they give me anything good is when I  Spending OVER $20. I’d say it’s worth playing in the begging. I will be deleting soon!,Better to play for a bit then delete
1,2023-09-20 22:35:55,"This game used to be fun, until the creators have made it nearly impossible to play without spending actual money.

2,2023-09-20 17:11:56,Please consider raising the bar for the amount of dice we get every hour. Or make it 30 minute intervals. Cause how can we play if we have no dice?  The limit should be raised to at least 300. We can’t do anything. Also the dice limit should be raised for board completions too. 50 dice after completing a board? Is crazy .,Limited dice is ridiculous

At least they are fair about how you win.",Why not increase dice and other prizes the father you get on the board
1,2023-09-03 22:28:36,This game is ridiculous. They give you goals that can only be made if you spend money.

3,2023-08-14 03:50:20,I think where it’s losing me is dice are so expensive and no matter what you keep getting the same cards it’s an app if I trade in my cards I would think I would get at least one new one but no then the tournaments make it ridiculous for people to finish,Love the game
1,2023-08-24 15:37:44,"It’s a fun game to play. I just wish it would offer more ways to get dice other than paying for them. And even when you get dice, it seems like the system eats all your dice up to make you buy more. Having to pay for dice, to me, really looses the fun out of it. I don’t like that fact that it makes it so hard to get the cards you need. This is what make people stop playing.",Fun game

3,2023-08-06 17:27:00,The higher we reach a level the harder it is to progress in the game. It becomes slow and dull. Gaining dice needs to be equated to the level the person is at. And I have now reached the level where the basic rewards can’t even buy me one house.,Money and dice and stickers
3,2023-07-31 14:05:15,8 rolls an hour is way to long. It takes half a day to get a full 80 rolls. That higher you get in levels the the more you need to complete your builds. It leaves waiting if you don’t win dice as rewards. Other than that excellent game all around,One complaint

5,2023-07-19 12:57:26,The game is pretty addictive but when you run out of dice it gets you kinda sad so I recommend connecting your face book and your phone number so you get free dice at the start,Good game
3,2023-07-19 20:42:46,It’s a good game but gets old really fast. You repeatedly get the same stickers and the wait time for dice is just way too long. It’s impossible to get anywhere in the game without spending a lot of money. Overall it’s fun to start but gets old quickly.,Stickers and dice
5,2023-07-17 20:46:24,I like it it has no ads except if you watch one for a free item but 1 problem you runout of dice so quick even without the multiplier but good game,My experience
5,2023-07-15 00:55:50,It is very interesting and it is no ads the only thing is it keep trying to make you buy stuff,This is my opinion
5,2023-07-14 17:19:17,This game is super fun to play! I just wish there was a easier way to get dice instead of waiting an hour for five. it has no adds so i think that’s a bonus.,Super Fun! No adds!

4,2023-07-13 15:38:40,Amazing game just the fact you have to wait an hour just for 5 rolls I think you should get the dice that your dice bar can hold like say you can hold 40 you should get 40 out 40 dice in like 15 minutes,Dice wait time
2,2023-07-11 09:20:51,I get you’re trying to make money. I spend money on this game myself. But to have to click out of FIVE ads as soon as I open the game is ridiculous.

1,2023-04-15 18:54:26,I seriously question if this is even a game. I have seen idle games with more interaction. All you do is roll dice and get money by landing on properties. If you hit a railroad you can steal someone’s money in a random lottery mini game or click on one of the landmarks they have used their money to build and get some money.   That is literally all you do. Roll dice and get money. Got boring after 2 minutes.,What is this?

3,2023-10-05 16:30:08,Very addicting but they try hard to get you to spend money which I will not do. Why do we get 8 copies of cards and can’t get the ones to finish. It’s fun though. I’ll add this. It’s a mind wasting game. No strategy involved. You roll to win dice to roll to win dice to roll to win dice.,Addictive yet manipulative

Last time this happened I lost progress. They gave 200 dice as an I’m sorry.  NOW I’m  sorry I spent money on this game and I want my money back.

1,2023-09-20 10:41:11,The system sends a bot to steal half of your bank every so often or when you don’t use it. It’s insane. The game is already purposely rigged and just adding a bot to steal is so infuriating that I don’t want to play anymore. They charge somewhere around $2-5 dollars for a million in game currency and just took 333 million with their own in game designed bot. And they keep doing it every 2-4 days. Why?!,Steals money
1,2023-09-17 07:49:02,The game used to be fun and a great way to pass time or relax. But it’s been so difficult to get cards for albums and the rate of dice replenishing is so slow that it’s become irritating. My friends were having fun trading cards and competing but we all need the same cards and none of us have any gold cards. We are all over it and most of us aren’t even playing anymore.,Used To Be Fun
3,2023-09-13 11:10:55,The odds in the game are horrible. And with the new season they lowered the rewards of all the sticker albums. Everyone always needs the same stickers so rarely anyone gets certain stickers. The game has also been random all stealing players resources like dice,Fun game horrible odds horrible changes
1,2023-09-12 03:32:34,I LOVED this game when I first started playing. I made all my family and friends Download it because I enjoyed it so much. I dislike the fact that you get Waaaayyy less dice/rewards with this new album and it’s harder to complete the sets. Even the pink vault is more than it was in the previous Album. It like you have to nonstop spend to get anywhere in the game. It’s no longer fun.,Loss Love

1,2023-09-01 12:50:01,Lemme start by saying I like the game. A semi competitive game with some fun mini games. What I don’t like is how the game is being changed for the worse. Requirements for rewards like the largest sticker crate have been almost tripled.  My other major issue is that the game looks and moves slower for some reason. I think the FPS was capped and we haven’t been given the option to uncap it.,Changing the game for worse
1,2023-08-30 11:36:55,The fact that I have spent a large amount of real money on this game and still can’t get the last gold card I need to finish the set is beyond ridiculous. Then you have the audacity to offer a pack that is $60 with a guaranteed card that I need. You must be crazy. I’m not spending another dime on this crappy game. If I could give this card zero stars I would bc it’s not worth it!,Lame
2,2023-08-27 15:30:36,This game is a masterful waste of time. You legitimately just roll and roll and roll hoping the monopoly gods bless you with a new sticker. Then there’s the Facebook group filled with people who are so into it that they’re scamming other people with bogus trades. Unless of course you have money to waste then you can just keep buying more rolls.,Addicting Time Waster
3,2023-08-24 18:48:27,Give us new stickers!! This is ridiculous. And better board rush amounts and better prizes for the little side competitions things.

2,2023-08-17 12:55:23,Decent game but what turns me off and has me about to delete game is that every time you open the app or roll your last dice the game has like 5 pop ups asking you to buy more stuff and I mean EVERY TIME!. I have a couple friends that play also and they all feel the same way it’s a turn off and hella annoying. STOP BEGGING!,Begging
4,2023-08-12 20:52:55,Wish there was a way to send your friends or other people dice as a gift. It’s fun. Once you get further along you need the ability to have more dice or the prizes are almost impossible to achieve.,Fun but…

2,2023-07-05 16:58:53,My community chest keeps telling me to pick 1 more friend and I can’t even click on anyone’s name game worked fine until this morning when they did “bug fixes and improvements” I’m in 2nd place right now to get like 750 dice 13 mil and a sticker pack and am gonna be really upset if I lose because of this,Game stuck on community chest
5,2023-06-30 22:50:33,It’s so fun!!!! The game is extremely fair and I might even say it is better than the actual board game 😍I promise you won’t regret downloading this and I promise I’m not gaslighting anyone this is amazing,Favorite online board game💕
5,2023-06-29 15:14:40,The game is cool the only thing is it takes a hour to get dice lol or they keep popping up about spending money to get dice that needs to be fixed hour for dice and the pop ups,Ok
5,2023-06-25 15:33:28,"I absolutely love the game, are you able to change: 1: the number of shares a day 2: allow us to share rolls with friends 3: make it easier to share 5star cards!! The game is really fun addicting!!",Coolest Game
5,2023-06-08 20:10:39,I feel like we should be able to send our rolls to our friends because I have so many and don’t need that many.,Rolls
5,2023-04-29 16:26:53,"Very rarely do I, (20 year old female) , find tycoon games that keep my attention like this one does! It’s hard to put down, and everything runs smoothly!",This game is amazing!
4,2023-06-07 23:51:54,"When you land on “go to jail”, the game acts as if that square is the jail.  When you roll doubles to be released, it starts you at the “go to jail” instead of from the actual jail.  The actual jail square has no purpose in the game whatsoever.  Get it TOGETHER",My only complaint.
1,2023-05-28 02:33:24,"After playing multiple hours I have come to realize the game purposefully targets you for negative actions if you are doing “too” well. After multiple weeks of 4-5 people per day attack my board, I had a successful day for once. I had 14, yes 14 people attack me in 4 hours. Quite literally setting me back hours. So disappointed and makes me not want to continue to play.",Disappointed
3,2023-05-20 17:16:51,Every time you open the app there’s like 4 pop up’s you have to close. Every time you run out of rolls there’s 2 or 3 pop ups asking you to buy more. Very annoying. But the gameplay is fun enough,Fun app but the pop ups are incredibly annoying and very frequent
3,2023-05-15 21:25:54,How do you unfriend someone? This guy targets me EVERY time. I can’t get anything done. I don’t want him as a friend so he won’t be able to target me unless I target him. There has to be a way after your have accepted a friend request to then delete the person. Other than that I love this game.,Removing People
5,2023-04-26 14:01:47,I’m a huge fan of the board game Monopoly but now that I’ve found out that I can play MonopolyGO on my phone I’m even more in love! Thank you for making it so you can play it on your devices now! It’s Awesome!!!,MonopolyGO

1,2023-11-10 07:26:07,The game started out fun but now not so much! 8 rolls every hour is ridiculous. You get more shutdowns than bank heist & epic myths is a JOKE!!! Literally been getting the same stickers over & over for a month now… i feel like the game is rigged to get people to spend money. Even the prices for dice are high! $9.99 for 250 rolls $4.99 for 95 rolls… just isnt fun anymore nor worth playing at this point.,Waste of time
1,2023-11-06 23:04:55,They shouldn’t allow people who aren’t your friend access to your money for bank heist and they need to cut the wait time down for dice and stop trying to force people to buy dice and stickers it makes no sense to keep giving out the same stickers knowing people are trying to finish their sticker challenge,Things they need to make the app better
5,2023-11-02 14:46:08,I’m not one to be playing games because of how busy my schedule is. I find myself playing this game in between job sites and at doctors while waiting.,Cool Game
3,2023-11-02 15:07:58,The game is fun don’t get me wrong but it’s so hard to get the cards you need I keep getting the same cards every time. Which is frustrating as heck. In all honesty that’s really the only thing that needs to change,Things need to change
5,2023-10-30 23:15:56,Can I get an idea when gold cards will become available? Not duplicates but those I can actually use or trade. Thank you,Gold
3,2023-11-01 22:31:30,"So since the update with the shields I haven’t been able to get any, I’m still with the orange ones and kinda makes me mad. But overall fun concept of a game. Basically pay to win at this point because it takes too long to get dice.",No new shields?
2,2023-11-01 17:41:11,"For the past two months I feel as if this game crashes a lot….always losing progress and never really getting compensated properly, it is kinda fun at first but it is expensive, repetitive cards, and you can lose all your progress like I did if it crashes mid game play :/",This game crashes ALOT
4,2023-11-01 17:22:55,I love the app but now it keeps glitching when I buy property earn dice and tolls for events an error occurred message appears and the game restarts but the issue continues to happen. I reached out online with no help or answer.,Issues

2,2023-11-01 16:04:30,There is a bug that everytime I get a color set.  It tells there is a errors and it needs to restart the game.   Guess what?

2,2023-10-30 12:18:29,"Honestly, this tournament was just a bust. It was the worst one yet. How do you expect someone to get double the points that  already we’re expected  and with the same amount of time and the same amount of prizes not to mention, there are less wheels I just can’t with this game. It’s really giving very much greedy.",Spooky tournament
1,2023-10-29 17:37:46,"I really have enjoyed playing this game and have gotten several family members and friends involved; however, we are all done after this event. Monopoly keeps raising the bar of what’s required to participate and has made it virtually impossible to be competitive and finish events without spending significant amounts of money.   Super disappointed. Monopoly do better.",Disappointing
4,2023-10-28 20:37:36,I feel like there should not be a limited amount of rolls for your turn. It is a good game and that is just my opinion so other people might have different ones.,I love it but there is one flaw

4,2023-10-21 05:03:53,Good game but needs better rewarding system for stickers and dice for paying players.  Like maybe a monthly membership where members would get extra dice and exclusive stickers also trade 4 star stickers.  I love monopoly and I really enjoy the game.,Good game
5,2023-10-16 10:04:18,My games is stuck on daily rewards. The daily reward is blank and when I try to collect it doesn’t let me. 😩😩😩,Stuck
3,2023-10-20 05:50:43,It's a very fun and entertaining game but once you have a certain amount of dice and your a fairly new player It will take all your dice back down to 0.. this has happened to me twice since I've been playing this game but overall it's a good game.,Fun game but...
3,2023-10-19 00:08:10,"I’ve been at a stand still for about a month , no new stickers, can’t get enough dice to make progress on any event to get more dice or better stickers. Can’t finish an album because I can’t score enough to get the higher cards….what gives…🤨",Annoyed

This makes me not want to play this anymore. If you are having problems with servers then the game should be able to save locally so it can sync later.,Not saving progress

1,2023-09-20 04:01:07,This game g bc as become such a joke it’s all about you all making money. You can’t get any new card even non god but gold even harder it’s ridiculous trying to keep dice.  They need to go back to the way it was before they forced the update on us.  I. Probably gonna remove the fame and quit playing because I’m not going to be spending money on play this game it’s a joke,Complaint
5,2023-09-17 10:58:39,Been playing this game for a month or two now. I don’t think there has been a single day between that I haven’t played. It is addicting!,Great game

2,2023-09-11 04:30:54,Really fun addictive game but if you play long enough you realize the creators only care about money. I think it’s like 3$ for 30 rolls which is just an outrageous price to start at  I personally haven’t spent any money on the game but I think if people are spending their hard earned money it should account for something.,Great Game… At First
2,2023-09-11 04:20:27,At first I liked the update because the game went faster but it keeps not giving me dice that I earn and not giving me cookies I land on.

Like come on.",Gold cards
3,2023-08-27 14:35:11,this game is fun and all but the amount of ads/pop ups for the “deals” is ridiculous. Everytime you’re out of dice you have 3+ pop ups of the game trying to have you buy the packs on the game for more dice or special items. The ads need to go!,TOO MANY ADS/POP UPS

3,2023-08-19 01:43:00,The game is overall really great. The main issue is with trading cards. You are really susceptible to scams with no way to get your card back. It would be nice if they implemented a way to actually trade versus gifting cards and just hoping the other person sends their card as well.,Trading Scams
4,2023-08-18 01:36:56,I love this game I just feel that everything we move on to another board the more dice we should be getting being that the price of property jumps up as well but other than that it’s cool,It’s addictive

Build structures with money to move to a new board to build structures with money to move to a new board while just clicking a button to collect money the entire time. Why is this entertaining? What is the appeal? I’m truly at a loss… and I love monopoly.",What even is the point of this?
5,2023-07-16 01:20:04,There should be an easier way to report  people selling the cards!,Where can we report people selling the cards ?
3,2023-07-21 20:43:03,It would be nice if dice rolls were set at 30 per hr it would keep people play. 7 rolls an hr just isn’t worth it and I’m definitely not gonna check back in every hr give us a chance to advance instead of being stuck just money hungry is all this game is about,Dice roles

I’m sick of the lack of awareness on your end for your players instead you fill your pockets and don’t even update the games properly. All you care about is money and it’s sick, someone needs to figure out a way to stop you. This type of gaming needs to end","Scopley you’ve outdone yourself, congratulations"

4,2023-07-15 17:05:36,I love this game but I’m irritated at this point because this is the second time I haven’t received my rewards. The event just ended at I was #1 on my leaderboard but yet I received no type of rewards. This needs to be fixed I’m missing 2500 rolls,..
5,2023-07-09 15:50:28,This game is great ..wish you could chat with your friends. I think that would be easier to trade stickers but the game itself is awesome!!!,Chat feature
1,2023-07-12 16:04:23,I enjoyed playing this game until you needed certain cards. You try to trade and people need the same one or only have one. You can’t trade golds but they give you more than one of that same card. Then if you spend money you don’t get any of the cards you need and it’s like the game makes you roll crap to waste the rolls you have so you would buy more.,Feels like a scam
4,2023-07-09 23:11:28,"I absolutely love this game, but why does it not give you the points for chance when you land on it and it tells you to go to railroad? It should give you the hats for both chance and railroad but doesn’t?",Love this game but…
5,2023-07-07 14:44:19,Monopoly go is fun for long car rides and at home I can play this in the car I think it uses No Wifi! Thanks for making this game! It helps me when I’m bored😁,Why monopoly go is Fun!
5,2023-07-05 22:58:29,Love this game. Just downloaded yesterday and it so fun!  It has been crashing a lot during events which is frustrating.,Crashing

1,2023-07-06 21:58:01,It’s a good game. To play  and it’s very enjoyable until you get stock.. there is a glitch that’s need to be fixed. Once the game freezes no matter what you do it won’t you play.. soo please maintenance team work on that glitch..  to have to reset the whole Game when you already getting so far.  I don’t want to keep resetting it and startig all over again ..,Fix the glitches
3,2023-07-06 08:13:41,Personally I love the game I just feel like it’s not worth it because you only get 5 rolls then here comes the purchase options to stay In the game at this point I don’t mind looking at a few ads to get some free rolls I just joined today and I’ve spent to much for a app 😭,Crashing
2,2023-07-05 23:39:06,I’ve enjoyed this app other than the fact that I can’t play it. I’ll have a solid 15 minutes of play and it’ll restart. Closing out and going back in takes several attempts where it doesn’t load past 30% before crashing and restarting.,Too many app crashes
4,2023-07-05 21:45:14,The game froze on the same screen for 5 minutes. Each time I opened the app the game displayed an error message and reset 6 times before it even let me sign up. Definitely not worth the glitching.,Nope

4,2023-07-05 18:09:59,I’ve been playing this game a little over a month and now since the update won’t allow my app to load past 30% someone please fix this,Monopoly go not working
3,2023-07-05 15:57:06,As of today with the new Baking Partner event the game has been crashing non stop. It either won’t log in or crashes during play of the game. Not good. Not good at all. Please tell me this is being addressed. I’m going to require plenty of roll dice to make up for the lost time in this event.,Game crashing
3,2023-07-05 13:51:29,I was having fun until it would not work I would be playing it then it would say errors and I would have to reset the game and it still wouldn't work so I am extremely mad at the creators of this app and they need to fix it😡😡😡😡,Download but be careful
5,2023-07-03 00:52:43,The electric version is wonderful. I wouldn’t liked to see more opportunities for dice or  longer play it’s not like you can win money  as a prize to play.,All time favorite
5,2023-06-30 02:30:42,I just wish there were more mini games ! The token game with robot is fun. I feel like the stickers are getting more complicated to collect and people might get bored with it.,Love this game !
5,2023-06-22 20:29:37,Love the game but can you up the trading cards to 10-15 a day? Just doing 5 cards a day and trying to complete the sets and help others will take too long,Game
2,2023-06-23 20:17:11,"super disappointed. i’ve had this game for over a month and genuinely enjoyed it. i like the side games and quests but i updated it as it requested me to do, and wouldn’t let me roll or show the complete board. i restarted everything and still. nothing. just deleted it cuz it’s not worth the battle. usually fun but bugging",Disappointed
5,2023-06-11 20:27:42,Great game! My friends and I are hooked. I just wish I could see my milestone progress for the main events. Right now it’s “wildlife tales”. I want to know how close I am to the final milestone.,"Great game, just one complaint"
5,2023-06-05 11:43:03,"This is a really fun and addicting game! I would definitely recommend it. Also, I love that MonopolyGO embraces diversity. Good riddance to all the triggered snowflakes writing bad reviews. Don’t worry, I’ve purchased enough packs for all of you.",Great Game
4,2023-06-11 13:53:48,"I love this game it’s very addictive and nice with no ads. Although I’d like to watch ads for free dice at times. ALSO after the new update, my free gift won’t load even when the 18 hrs is done so pls fix that bug :) other than that amazing",Good But!
5,2023-05-04 00:54:39,I wasn’t sure how I felt about it at first but I do love it now. The game walks you through everything you need to know in an understandable way. It’s entertaining and has great graphics.,Fun
3,2023-06-05 11:37:55,Fun game especially if you want to kill some time. The only downside I have are the excessive popups trying to get you to spend money on more dice. Would be nice to have a “do not show today” button option vs me having to exit out of the popups every time I’m low or out of dice.,Fun
3,2023-05-31 15:30:28,"I had over 7M to my name and in less than 12 hours, I only had 250K left???

It was fun while it lasted tho!",What happened to all my money??

1,2023-05-12 22:40:46,Everything was goin okay and when I went to play today the game didn't load all I got was black screen. Deleted the game 2 times and reinstalled it and I'm still getting the same issue. Went on my wife's phone and my friend phone who also play the game and they have no issue.    At this point im just goin to uninstall and no longer play. It was fun while it lasted,Not fun anymore
1,2023-05-10 01:21:34,I have had several friends I have added the game Does not give credit it shows i have added (2) when in fact it has been over 10. I also have not received credit for the daily  log in yesterday it did not add my rolls nor the money it said I won. I  reached out to customer service over 10 days ago with no response  .,Game does not give credit

4,2023-05-03 14:49:08,This game is very fun but I wish their were more aspects to it that would be challenging for the players. Like if we could actually play with each other online,Wish it was more challenging
5,2023-04-27 20:38:18,It’s a masterpiece if you’re looking for a game like the board game you’re not gonna get what you’re expecting but it’s gonna be so fun and it’s gonna take a whole new turn for monopoly,Perfect
5,2023-04-24 08:09:23,The game is so amazing for when your board and have nothing to do so if you see this please play because the game is amazing for playing!  You can play with friends,Amazing!
5,2023-04-20 19:13:40,This game is cute and different then the regular monopoly. I just recently downloaded it but it seems pretty fun so far. I will probably update once I play the game a little bit more.,Cute game
5,2023-11-10 00:49:10,The game is rigged for the people willing to spend money. If you don’t waste your $$$you get bad rolls and can’t land on good places or get stickers you need. Started out good now it just wants $$$.,Jim

2,2023-11-05 20:40:39,You should put the name of friend or who we sent a sticker to so that it shows up on our end and we can have list of the names we sent cards to. It’ll be a good idea because at least it’ll show how much cards and how helpful we are by helping others 👍👍just a thought,Card review
4,2023-11-05 02:23:41,"When the app first starts up, the player has to exit out of a bunch of windows trying to make them spend money.",Too pushy with the pay to win.
3,2023-11-03 15:06:28,"I love this game but to have any real success its expensive. I have spent 100s of dollars and have never once completed all the sticker albums. For your sanity, dont use your own money. Also the “deals” are priced differently for each player.",Expensive/Addictive
2,2023-11-03 13:48:55,"I’m so obsessed with this game, but it’s such a money grab. The game will glitch so much, everyone looses a ton of in game resources, only for them to give a tiny compensation to act like it’s fine.

4,2023-11-01 23:25:26,The game is really fun but during technical issues it took over 400 dice causing me to get behind in some of the games which is extremely frustrating. Overall fun game though.,When it’s good… it’s good….

1,2023-11-01 15:31:02,"This game has taken the fun out of it by their greed.   There used to be a decent amount of ways to get dice and the needed cards for events. Now they have upped the number of items required to win events, and made it so you can’t win unless you spend real money. And even then it feels that the dice rolls are rigged. I used to love this game but now it more stress then it’s worth.",Frustrating

3,2023-10-23 06:30:31,Absolutely love the game only problem with it is when you run out of rolls even if it’s because the multiplier is too high you get a pop up for to buy rolls and to invite friends. Really gets annoying after awhile…,Pop ups
5,2023-10-08 23:56:05,Would be great if you could exchange gold stickers for ones you actually need instead of having numerous duplicates,Stickers
1,2023-10-18 01:05:51,There bots that play the game so you spend money 😡and you keep getting repeat card that are like one star and it’s like puff god and stuff 👶 and the game is very addictive so you spend tons of money 💸💲💳 but you send the link to your friends and then they spend a lot of money too💸💰TIP when somebody has one person destroyed then it’s most likely they have shields 🛡️ so one star⭐️😬,A rip off

2,2023-10-13 21:49:39,When you finish 1st in the events. They don’t give you your rewards which is upsetting. Rolls take way to long to get. Not enough events to invite friends too. Takes forever to get the album done since you constantly get the same card over and over,Winning an event

4,2023-10-01 07:10:56,Stickers program is terrible! Takes way too long to get a album or star stickers. And should be much more than 50 dice to go to a new city. That is ridiculous. Thank you!,Stickers
2,2023-10-04 17:27:58,First when you complete a pack they don’t give that many rolls. It’s to hard to get stickers. It makes you not want to play. Every time you get on the game you only got a little bit of rolls so you really can’t do anything. Everybody is not in the position to spend money on this game.,Starting not to like it

1,2023-09-09 02:38:03,This game has repeatedly cheated me out of items that I won and progress made. I have made multiple reports and have had nothing fixed. As soon as this Choco tournament is over. I am deleting the stupid game. The only reason I’m not deleting it right now. It’s because I have other people depending on me to help them build their cakes. Do better!!!,Game cheats players out of items

5,2023-08-27 00:11:12,My niece had convinced me to download a silly monopoly game and oml. I play this morning to night. It’s so addicting and easy to play. I absolutely love the game and would recommend to anyone tbh. I cannot express how much I love it haha. Sweet game!,My Fav Game
5,2023-08-17 18:48:33,It’s fun u can play with friends and you can choose the people u want to destroy there land but you have to watch out for  Shield. It’s also kid friendly,What I like about this game
1,2023-08-26 15:13:46,The game is a fun game to play however they need to fix the way the stickers are given for albums after so long the game will continue to give you the same sticker over and over so you are unable to complete any albums I’ve been receiving the same stickers for 3 months so now its boring cause Im unable to complete anymore albums,Receiving stickers
1,2023-08-26 13:43:43,It has been 3 times I’ve completeled my quick wins and do not get my pink cards rewarded to me. Instead I just start all over like I never completed anything. It’s become frustrating and I am soon to complete another set and I’m SURE I will not get that set of pink cards again. I have contacted support and can’t even speak to a real person about my issue.,Not so happy.
4,2023-08-24 03:39:19,This game is great overall!  There are just a few recommendations to make it have MORE to it!  Add more mini games and addition of things you can do other than just landmarks and heists. I did like the car remodel event!,Awesome and interesting game!
1,2023-08-22 13:32:32,"This game is actually a rip off. The in game prizes aren’t enough to keep up fun game play. I have spent easily $200 on this game and have yet to finish any of my albums that you get a big reward for. I am very seriously thinking about deleting it. You can’t trade gold cards, you can’t win enough dice to keep playing, they just want you to spend money.",Don’t even waste your time
4,2023-08-21 14:37:07,I love monopoly go but the adds are all fake and just seem weird. The add should have a recorded video of an actual person playing the actual game. People may disagree but you will have to agree about updating the add.,The add
1,2023-08-19 01:39:17,The game is good but they don’t have a solid trading system and you will get scammed from folks on the monopoly go FB page.   Pay to play   You can’t send gold cards.  Pay to play   You only get 8 dice an hour to roll to get what you cards you can.   Pay to play   The game seems rigged.  Pay to play   No way you can play this game without spending money.   Pay to play   There’s no in game messaging system.   PAY TO PLAY   I’m definitely gonna delete this and come back down the line once they figure it all out. Like I said it has the potential to be a great game but times are hard and I’m not spending real money for make believe money.,Has potential
5,2023-08-16 23:57:45,"Dear Sirs,        I am enjoying the game and so are many members of my friends & family,  but one thing way always discuses is the fact the regeneration of the dice is unbelievable.   We all think it should be faster and more available.   Also we think the wheel spin after the hotels are cashed-in is such a weak move and the prizes are so low considering the effort it takes to get there.   The prizes should be increased",Dice regeneration
5,2023-08-16 03:03:39,You guys should do a neon light theme.   You guys should also put the car show back on there it was so much fun.   And you guys should make it where you can share your dice and money with your friends it will make the game more active   Also you guys should make it easier to collect dice because sometimes when I run out I go days without having dices   But the game is amazing it keeps busy,New updates suggesting
1,2023-08-16 22:00:57,"I love this game so much. But I’m so tired of all the glitching. During the event I couldn’t even get in for a hour, Shockingly I was able to finish it. When I made it to level 4,000 I never got my 2000 rolls. This is ridiculous that this happens every single big event and the lagging last for 2 weeks after. And then NOTHING for the issues we’ve been having. I’m just about to quit the game.",Bro.
5,2023-08-12 19:47:08,Monopoly is the greatest board game eve because I get too roll dices and earn them also I get a lot of money and move too different city’s and states,Monopoly is the greatest mobile board game ever
1,2023-08-15 04:17:56,The background images won’t load and the game isn’t working at all. I can’t go to settings and report this problem properly either. So I’m here giving your game a 1 star after enjoying it for a while no problems at all. It can’t be my phone because I’ve tried all other games on my phone and they work just fine,Broken
5,2023-08-12 15:02:12,I had over at least 500 shields and when my friend attacked my landmark I was down to 3 shields but I was only supposed to lose one shield since it was 1 attack.,Shields
5,2023-08-08 01:04:33,Wish there was a party mode or something to play on the side like an actual game of monopoly or side games of some sort but me and the guys at work are all downloading it,This is fun
3,2023-08-08 01:13:52,It’s a funny game an all but having to wait a whole hour for like 7 dice is crazy if we have to wait a whole hr we should get more dice an the cards are ridiculous to get like come one now you want ppl to play then make it worth it,Funny game but needs work
5,2023-08-04 02:49:31,I would like it if it was able to be played without internet,My one problem
4,2023-08-05 14:01:23,Only friend should be able to get each other cares because it’s teaching information to other people I’m serious😡,Reporting for personal information
1,2023-08-04 04:50:54,It’s too hard to find cards . They made it wayy too hard to get new cards you just get duplicates over and over so you can’t really level up or move foward in the game . Trading cards does not work that trading group is pointless. Starting to get bored with the game because I’m at a stand still and keep getting the same cards. Might delete soon .,Needs changes
5,2023-07-31 12:03:59,"It’s Very fun and addictive. These past few days that I had monopoly go I have been playing it all the time and you need a bit of fun in your life, Right? So download Monopoly GO!",5 Star Deserved Game
3,2023-08-03 23:31:37,Honestly I would’ve rated the game 5 it’s a quick daily game to play  but the addition of cash flow is annoying I’m not a child at chucky cheese and just waste my time when I’m trying to use my dice wish I had the option to not have it pop up,Cash flow
5,2023-07-28 15:13:54,For kids playing the group and to play with friends is all on Facebook so most kids can’t be included in some parts of the game,"I love this game but,"
1,2023-07-29 17:55:11,This games would be a little better if we wasn’t giving the same stickers and if we could have traded/share the gold stickers. Also the higher up we go in the levels we should be given more then 50 dice how can we play and move up more by just having that little bit of dice somethings need to change with the game,Stickers
4,2023-07-29 06:30:39,It’s not bad at all. I just feel that it should be a bit less complicated to find stuff . But besides that this game is awesome!! And there should definitely be different modes or versions.!! 👍🏾,Just one tinny problem 🫶🏽
5,2023-07-24 04:02:38,It’s a great game but missing rewards I messaged customer service about 15 days ago and still no response. So hopefully they read this and actually get back to me .,Great game …
3,2023-07-26 22:27:28,I got to level 4 and after all the stuff pops up it won’t let me click out of the screen. I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled and it still isn’t working even after the bug fix update. Please fix your game I am prematurely addicted,HELP
3,2023-07-26 09:21:24,"Way too many pop ups. I get tired of clicking past 10 pop ups every time I start the game or run out of dice, etc. They are far too aggressive trying to get you to purchase things from their incredibly overpriced store.","Fun, but…"
4,2023-07-24 21:32:34,Pretty good game overall. But at some point you completely stop getting new stickers and receive duplicates over and over even when trading back to the game,Pretty good overall
5,2023-07-11 23:52:01,The game is fun to play but it’s even better with friends. I wish we can pick and choose who we get to shutdown and and steal from. I be trying to get back at my friends 😂,GOOD GAME
3,2023-07-21 23:08:47,I really like the gameplay of monopoly but I have an issues like how come I get 2-8 stickers very often & not yet have I finished Wildlife tales it’s so frustrating that I spend money on this game & still don’t get anything good . So far I still play the game but it’s hard to even get dice .,Great Game
3,2023-07-21 13:08:39,"The game is very fun and good, but it keeps crashing on me and won’t even start at this point. It always says error. I was about to be awarded 3 check marks and some money so I hope when it finally works it will still give me my rewards",Crashing
1,2023-07-19 22:16:36,There is no way people should be receiving the same stickers over and over that they already have. This is the main reason I will not give you a high rating! Plus why aren’t gold stickers tradable? Why can’t you trade more than five stickers it shouldn’t be a limit! Also waiting an hour to get more dice is stupid. All these doggone ads to buy dice is redundant!!!,This game is rigged
3,2023-07-17 22:54:39,"I would give 5 stars but I find this game highly stressful, I think they should add the ability to pay for rolls with in game money, so you don’t have to wait an hour for 5+, I think this would be highly beneficial for gameplay",We need ways to earn rolls
1,2023-07-13 14:39:33,my app has had bug problems since the baking update event happened to the point where i have not been able to play and ive reached out to customer support several times a day every day for the last week with no response or assistance. used to be my favourite game but if you cant even care to help out the people whk WANT to play it then whatever i guess,support
2,2023-07-12 13:21:17,I really liked this game at first and it was fun leveling up and even trading with others for cards but once you reach a certain point it is nearly impossible to get new things without spending money. I’d avoid if possible as you’ll just end up frustrated at the end.,Good up to a certain point
5,2023-07-09 06:50:37,I was just on Facebook and noticed an ad by piggy go- clash of coins who is marking their game with monopoly go’s screen play basically!! I have a screenshot because I couldn’t tag anybody important in the comments!!,"Love the game, PIGGY GO IS STEALING YOUR CONTENT"

3,2023-07-10 16:05:52,They need to bring baking with partners back for good but the cake bar status should fill up easier or give us more time for four cakes and now we need more to do than shut down and bank heist. I been playing since it really first came out.,Monopoly go

5,2023-07-05 23:19:10,I LOVE THIS GAME!!! But today the game is not connected. It’s saying that there is an error and it has to restart. I sure hope and pray nothing is lost and everything is as I won it!!!!,You
5,2023-06-19 14:56:09,Lots of fun super addictive just wish that as someone who doesn’t use Facebook I could change my profile pic aside from that it’s great though,Great game
2,2023-07-05 22:02:10,Kinda hard to play when my game is constantly being interrupted by “We’re sorry and error occurred requiring the game to start” and then not being able to get back into the game 🤷🏼‍♂️  Otherwise gameplay is fun. Just really annoying to get constantly booted out of the game.,Big fix? Server overload? Who knows.
3,2023-07-05 20:51:07,It’s a fun game but there is always something going wrong and”if they see the problem they will fix it” today… games been down all day. Ppl have paid money and we are losing money when the game steals dice when crashing.,"It’s fun, but always an issue"
4,2023-07-01 15:23:38,What I like about when it comes to upgrading land marks it raises prices just a bit each board to keep The playing the player does not go to fast but not too slow either,Good playability
2,2023-06-21 17:03:47,"There was a mini game or contest of sorts running where if you placed high enough, you’d win rolls and cash. I was in the game when the countdown went to zero and I was in tenth place which would’ve given me 200 rolls and over $1 M in cash. The time run out and it just disappeared. Very disappointing. Please fix!!!!",Mini game disappeared no reward given

5,2023-06-14 15:21:16,Good game for long car rides and a great game to play with friends anytime and You can’t get that with any other games and really gives you the monopoly board game feeling and it’s a great game for people with adhd,Good game

4,2023-05-29 14:27:47,"Great game, but the only downside is that there are so many pop ups after running out of rolls. 2 minimum, and this is when you open the app for the first time in the day as well. Very frustrating","Great Game,,but"
4,2023-05-11 20:29:01,Love the game! Please update so friends are able to search each other to connect. It’s difficult to find friends without connecting through Facebook.,Can’t find friends
4,2023-05-08 13:13:37,"Yes, it is a fun game but there are some bugs… Recently I’ve had a friend join though my link and never revived my rewards from it. Maybe I did somthing wrong or they did but I feel as if I was cheated out of my rewards.",Bugs
3,2023-04-15 03:41:12,"This game is super fun and actually really enjoyable except for one thing.. you run out of rolls super fast and have to wait an hour for 5 moves. But even when you have over 100 moves, you get about 10 minutes of playtime if you are lucky.",Not very playable
1,2023-11-10 01:28:54,This game is fun in the beginning but the higher the level you lose interest in it because it’s too hard to accomplish anything without purchasing dice. Everything costs way more money to build but you get capped at 80 dice and 8 per hour which will get you no where. I find it to just be a money hungry app and it’s just not fun anymore.,Not fun anymore
1,2023-11-07 19:19:30,"The game makes it unrealistic to win unless you spend hundreds of dollars playing. It’s difficult to obtain dice, the the price of dice are ridiculously high. The algorithm for the board makes it impossible for you to capitalize on any dice you purchase. The boards are recycled but it costs more and more to complete them. When you do complete a board you only get 50 dice.",Money Pit

3,2023-10-30 20:55:13,I honestly believe this game is meant to make you fail this game can be fun but if your not paying then your not doing any good. Even spending money on this game I still get nothing good. It’s really starting to make me not like it.,If your not paying your not going to enjoy
1,2023-10-30 19:29:34,"Same cards all the time and I don’t need duplicates like 20 times of the same ones over and over.  I need boarding and the gold ones.

2,2023-10-29 02:41:13,The game started out fun…But the further you get into  the game you can not complete anything or the games or challenges because you don’t have enough dice. And 80  dice what is that the higher you go the more dice you should receive.  Game just not any more fun. They want you to keep spending money to get dice,Not fun anymore

I wouldn’t buy anything from this game because if you have any issues you probably won’t get any real help.,No customer service
3,2023-10-25 19:59:14,I’ve been in the top three of several tournaments and still only get the same stickers I already have when I get the 5 star blue pack of stickers 🤔 it’s annoying and makes the game irritating and pointless,Where’s the stickers
3,2023-10-24 00:35:03,I don’t understand why you keep giving these duplicates from the first few albums. Why make it so dang hard and when you only give 8 dice an hour. It’s really frustrating to keep playing,Gold and duplicate stickers

1,2023-10-18 16:38:45,I got second place on a tournament and did not receive my rewards! There isnt a good place to communicate with them! This game is a waste of time! And it’s rigged the double charge you when you by rolls and sometimes you have to wait 24 hours for your rolls you buy nut they charge you immediately! Wouldn’t recommend this game to nobody!,Disappointed and feel cheated!
5,2023-10-14 01:06:02,I love this game but all I get are duplicate stickers. It makes completing the sets more difficult. It would be nice if more new stickers were available in the packs,Love it but….
1,2023-10-15 18:05:17,Y’all sent me cash & 70 dice and no 4 star sticker in a event I won I spend money on this game y’all need to do better or I want spend any of my hard earned money on this game ever again!! Y’all need to stop being unfair y’all don’t want people cheating but y’all cheat the people make it make sense please!!!I would really like my four star card or a pink shield I seen y’all gave a lady on Facebook today 01:51 PM,Not Fair!!
2,2023-10-12 16:10:15,Tired of getting one star packets when 5 and still stars is what’s needed. As  the prices of landmarks increase so should the amount of dice we get when we complete each board. Why are we still only getting 8 dice an hour when we have 2 days to complete events ????,Frustrating
1,2023-10-13 20:38:13,I played on my daughters iPad and stole $6000 from my own bank and I logged in on my account and it said she stole 18.3 million and they took that from my bank. This game is lying and stealing big money from your balance. I knew they was making up numbers to steal from your balance. Not cool to take more money than what was actually stolen in a bank heist,Making up amounts to steal from balance

3,2023-10-06 17:41:19,I love the game but an hour just to receive 8 dice is crazy. Y’all could at least do 30 minutes. & the higher the level & you still only get 50 dice for moving on. This is why most people can’t finish the tournaments. We need more dice.,More Dice

1,2023-09-30 20:07:12,You can Trade your duplicate stickers in and they will just give you more duplicates but it’s takes 100 duplicate stickers just for them to turn around and give you 4 duplicate stickers back I consider this stealing…. Also the wheel spin always lands on either the 35 dice or the green safe that gives you cards you’ve already got… game makers are greedy individuals.,Game is a Scam
1,2023-09-30 14:57:18,"The developers give you good “beginners luck” but once that is done man they make it difficult to continue enjoying the game. 8 dice an hour is a joke, boards become so expensive to build you get stuck, getting out if jail continues to rise in price, becoming ridiculously expensive.

1,2023-09-28 16:51:39,Don’t download is game is rig. They don’t give Yu enough dice and they give yu the same card over and over making it impossible for yu to finish. And the milestones shouldn’t be 40/48 to complete just to get 6500 dice which is impossible to get because they only yu 80 dice. every 45 mins. And if yu already have the 80 dice they don’t not give yu more. So don’t download it’s not fun anymore,Don’t waste your time

3,2023-09-27 15:17:08,Really loved the game till you get stuck on simple cards an can’t build any more boards so you get bored with the game because it dosent give you anything to help anymore so it makes it hard then everyone destroys your stuff an you get no dice,I loved it

1,2023-09-20 13:53:13,It’s stupid I’m having to write a review here bc I can’t get a live human only a bot and ignored by said bot when I message support. I missed an entire wheel boost bc of an error that won’t let me progress to the next board I saved my money for this wheel boost and can’t even get passed board 146. So kindly please tell me how I’m supposed to enjoy a game when I can’t play the dang thing in the first place,Stupid

4,2023-09-04 17:56:48,Loved the game until they basically made it to where you have to spend money to get farther now it’s not as fun cause I almost never have dice and can’t get a gold card to finish my sets.,Monopoly go!
4,2023-09-04 01:38:24,"This game would be the greatest of all time IF: you got your maximum roll capacity regenerated, instead of the 5,6,7, etc, rolls/hour.  Fix that, then there isn’t a single thing to complain about!",Fun but let’s get real…

Why is it that we need to pay for the good but if we don’t pay (I don’t) then we get a base amount of dice and if you manage to hit something big then maybe you get a streak going and have fun for 15 mins.

3,2023-07-25 14:38:40,The game started out fun but waiting all that time for a little dice is insane and constantly getting the same stickers is boring completing boards and only getting 50 rolls is not enough I’m really thinking about deleting the app because it’s not fun anymore,Getting boring

2,2023-06-13 19:29:38,The game is fun. Except when you up your multiplier on the dice. When it’s x10 or more the game doesn’t pay out 10x on chances or on dice. They want you to buy the dice. Which is not fair and very deceptive. Currently the game won’t even load past 32%. I’m probably going to lose all my progress.,Chasing money. Multiplier doesn’t fully multiply chances or dice.

3,2023-10-20 17:36:47,If I spend money on buying packages in the game then all packs of cards should give out a new card. This is getting crappy for not giving new cards out anymore. The game is getting less & less of my time.,It’s getting worse!

1,2023-10-01 16:07:42,This game is very fun and addicting at first but I have never played a more rigged game. The algorithm doesn’t allow you to land where you need and it is set up for you to waste your dice and then push you to buy more. Without a change to the algorithm I fully believe these dice rolls are predetermined and not “random” there is no way. Just a warning.,Don’t waste your time and money
1,2023-09-29 06:37:43,I feel like this game needs to be voice over accessible so blind people can play it as well but it’s not which I think it’s kind of stupid because someone sent me a link to play with them last night so this ain’t voiceover accessible it needs to be because I’m sure blind people want to try it too so I like the music of it so I wanted to try it out as well,Vision

1,2023-09-27 05:30:17,I have no idea how this game has good reviews either they delete all the terrible ones or use bots to make good ones.

2,2023-09-06 23:12:42,The amount of dice you win has gotten lower and you keep getting the same stickers you already have.

1,2023-09-04 00:25:03,One of the worst games I’ve played on my phone. You never get what you want always rolling one or two spaces away from what would actually make a difference. It happens far too often to be a coincidence. Hitting go to jail 4 or 5 times in a row around the board. Landing on tax and squares that do nothing wasting rolls. When it’s not boring it’s frustrating. Shameless cash grab.,Terrible

5,2023-08-27 23:39:19,I love this game but I don’t like how people can change their revenge because then they go after one person all the time and it’s not fair.,Monopoly
3,2023-08-28 20:50:06,It would be nice if there was a way to ask your friends directly on the app for stickers. You won’t run into people trying to sell high value stickers for money as they currently are on several of the Facebook pages.,Gifts

3,2023-08-27 02:14:18,It doesn’t make sense that everyone needs the same cards throughout the game. We play long and hard enough and invest enough to get the cards needed. Try giving some cards we actually can use!,Too many duplicates!
2,2023-08-26 23:14:27,The trading system still needs an update. Players need to be required to approve a trade before a trade goes though. I have been scammed. I shouldn’t send a card to someone and HOPE they send me a card as a trade. It should be a sure thing when sending 5* and customer service didn’t help me at all.,Trading system

3,2023-08-24 06:41:33,I like the game but it keeps giving you the same stickers. It needs to be a limited on how many of the same stickers you get. The gold frame stickers are really hard to get and you can’t even share them.,Stickers
1,2023-08-18 20:44:00,I have gotten an abundance of stickers over the past week and not one new one. It’s very frustrating to continue to get duplicate stickers when reaching milestones. When trading out stickers I continue to get the same stickers back as more duplicates. Everyone I know is missing the same exact stickers as if the game is not sending those out at all.,No new stickers
5,2023-08-16 20:23:12,This game has no bugs or anything one thing is though you should make it so you can buy dice with the money you get like 100 dice should cost 500 or something like that!,THE FUNNEST GAME EVER
1,2023-08-16 23:27:57,All this game does is give u plenty of money but not enough dice. The only way is to complete a set which u cant do when u are down to the last 10 or buy dice. Lately if u pay attention u mostly land on the same stuff it just repeats so u dont get the prizes and makes u buy more dice.  All this game is now is a scam. It was fun at first but now its rigged to get nothing most of the time,Game not good

4,2023-06-18 19:25:18,i am absolutely obsessed with this game right now. i’ve been playing against my cousins and it’s real intense. i keep trying to demolish their cities but run out of rolls quickly. i think there should be an option where you get to watch ads for free dice. i would sit there and watch every ad just to keep robbing my cousins. not only would it keep me playing your game but it would also make you guys more money by sponsoring ads,overall a solid game
5,2023-06-15 08:11:46,"Monopoly go has been a very good experience so far and I hope it will get even better. I love this game, I just started this game a couple days ago and I’m now in m industries",Good

3,2023-06-11 06:29:21,I loved this game before I had to do the update.  I was supposed to get 1200 dice for updating the game and now it won’t do anything when I push roll and it keeps freezing.  I just want to uninstall the update so I can go back to the way it was.,Fun before update

2,2023-05-22 18:32:37,"this game doesn’t resemble or play like the real board game. Thats why i even got it in the first places to to have a board game monopoly where i could chose what to buy, what to sell, etc. But here is literally none of that it’s just hold the button to make the dice auto roll and the game plays itself 😐. it’s boring",disappointing
3,2023-05-02 22:11:02,This game is really fun but once you spend all the dice it makes it really hard to build back up unless you spend money I think it is pay to win the timer should be adjust to like 10 minutes gives you 5 dice,Mid
5,2023-11-10 13:50:04,Give more dice for each level you go up and every hour. And stop giving so many duplicate stickers,Dice

3,2023-11-03 18:08:02,The game itself is fine. I like the twist on the classic game but it wouldn’t be a Scopely game if it wasn’t for a ton of paywalls. I don’t need to see 3-4 advertisements every time I run out of rolls. Scopely is a huge reason I stopped playing Marvel Strike Force and it seems like they’re at it again.,Meh

Like today for instance every 3rd roll and it pops up an error message and restarts the game and takes me backwards. And the sticker collections I do t feel as if I should have to buy over priced packages to obtain stickers with higher values.,Too many glitches and sticker frustration
2,2023-11-01 17:02:40,The game restarts and glitches so much when you finally come up on dice and wheels. I even screen recorded what it does because this game gladly takes my money and wants to work but once I stop paying then I have so many issues. And sometimes it steals what I earn when it restarts the app. So unfair.,They cheat

I find it quite funny I landed on those corners multiple times in a row or almost every few rolls I land on the corner. Now we have a mission that involves them and all the sudden I’m not landing on any of the corners. But I bet once this mission ends i will land on go or jail numerous times again. Stupid,Missions
1,2023-10-27 23:01:36,Partner event was always fun to do and obtainable. They have now increased how many points you need for each partner. I was barely finishing the last events. Also new cards from the final packs are about impossible to obtain unless you win tournaments. If you want to be able to get stuff in this game you must spend a lot of money to get things.,Money grab to the extreme
1,2023-10-26 00:35:40,I started out really enjoying this game. I saved up my stickers to open the largest safe with 2500 stickers….I earned 2 new stickers…TWO NEW STICKERS FOR 2500. I’m done with the game. The stickers it gave me weren’t even the golden ones that are like impossible to get.

5,2023-08-03 01:53:10,I love this game so much you should totally download it it’s very fun although it’s a couple things I don’t really like but other than that this is actually a very good game,Great game!!!
1,2023-08-12 08:15:37,There needs to be a cap on how much money people can steal from you. I had 988m now I have 10. I can’t do anything anymore because it’s so hard to pay for the buildings and it’s impossible to earn dice because we can’t get the stickers we need or win challenges because ordinary people like me can’t afford to waste real money on this game. So done.,So done with this game
1,2023-08-04 04:01:20,No matter how much time you play you will not be able to get good or to a really good point unless you spend money into this game and even after you spend money it doesn’t get you too much. This game should be better in many different ways and it’s very repetitive. Yeah monopoly is fun but this is nothing like the original game.,Not worth the time or money
4,2023-08-03 21:44:49,This is a horrible app and I do not recommend it to anyone they make you pay for things that you don’t want to pay for it’s just bad all around.,Never get this app
3,2023-08-03 15:51:15,"I really love the game but the issue with the cards and the groups it’s crazy! I can play for days and no new card even if I pay nothing comes good, you need to keep the people happy and playing if not we get frustrated.",It’s fun but frustrating
5,2023-07-26 03:06:44,This is highly addicting I started playing three hours ago at work and haven’t stopped yet,Can’t get enough
4,2023-07-29 15:19:38,I love the game but my only problem is every time I have to update the game I can’t play it for about 2-3 days or even longer. I have uninstalled the game and reinstalled it and I still can’t play,Monopoly go
5,2023-07-26 01:34:39,MonopolyGO is such a fun game Shout out to the creator of MonopolyGO! I am only 9 years old and I play this game my cousins and aunt are my friends even though I don’t have Facebook I still love it!! #CreatorCreation #MonopolyGo #Big Money🥰💎👑✅💰💵🤑🎲,MonopolyGO is so awesome!!!
5,2023-07-25 08:42:37,It’s a great game when your bored. Slightly addicted but it’s okay it’s worth the try. It’s even better when you play with your friends. 10/10 🫶🏽,Great game
5,2023-07-22 13:31:56,This game is fun but can y’all make it so we can get the stickers we need. Also we need a better system of adding friends so we can trade,Addicting
5,2023-07-16 03:33:40,I love this game it gives me something to do when I’m bored and in love it it gets me so excited to play and this game is definitely a 5 star game this game definitely needs more hype,Best game ever
4,2023-07-21 13:05:18,"This is my first time playing, my daughter downloaded it to my phone and I love it; the time passes so quickly when you’re playing. It’s relaxing and so much fun very enjoyable.",First time Playing
1,2023-07-19 13:35:35,"All the game does is go around and around in circles. No skill is required outside of spending money for more rolls, which is required because you can’t make progress in this game without spending money. And then other people are allowed to steal what you have: monopoly bucks and destroying your buildings. There are other games that are actually fun to play. Deleting the “game”.",Repetitive
4,2023-07-19 05:42:20,Fun game but they real want your money. Just to start the game you have to exit out 5 things trying to sell you in game purchases. It makes me not want to even open the game.,To much of a money grab
5,2023-07-14 21:55:26,I have always loved Monopoly. Can’t get others to play with me without them cheating - I win anyway! Love Monopoly Go. I uploaded on my computer but it never worked right.,Monopoly Addict
5,2023-07-10 05:04:25,And another thing you guys should boost the trading amount to at least 10. Overall great game 10/10,Needs a little tweaking 2.0
1,2023-07-11 18:03:41,"Anytime the game is loaded and/or you are low on dice rolls you get 4-5 offers to purchase more, one after the other. It’s annoying honestly! If you do make a purchase you may/may not receive what you purchased. Should you contact customer service about it good luck getting a response. 2-4 day response time is not accurate.",Purchase Offers & Poor CS
3,2023-07-11 13:17:35,The game is entertaining overall but I don’t like that I spend my hard earned money trying to get the lil bit of spins they give in those packages save my money only to have every single dollar stolen. The heist are apart of the game and fun and all but stealing 200m leaving you with 0 is beyond me COIN MASTER WOULD NEVER,Ok but…..
5,2023-07-10 02:01:48,This game is literally so fun to play but sometimes it has bugs but you get rewards after a bug so it makes up for it anyway super fun to play with friends.,MONOPOLY GO

3,2023-07-08 14:45:12,It’s fun but after a while it’s really not. Everything costs real money and it’s not fun anymore. Then you have to wait five hours just to get 40 more rolls which isn’t even that much. I recommend the game only if you are patient. :),Fun until it’s not..
1,2023-07-07 21:58:31,"I’ve been stuck in the same bank heist since Monday. It’s now Friday. I can’t contact support bc they want a user ID that is generated by them, numbers only, and I can’t access it bc I’m stuck in a heist.

2,2023-07-07 00:12:09,I’ve lost progress with the game. I was kicked out and I was about to get 1500 dice on creative accounting. I re open the game and I have to start from the beginning. I still had a day left and some hours. There’s no way I’ll be able to make it back to the same spot now. Really disappointing.,Glitching a lot
5,2023-07-05 17:20:19,I love love monopoly and invest so much time in there. But after the new banking even started my gane is not working at all.. just keeps loading,Game is just loading!!
3,2023-07-05 23:14:48,I love this game but now I feel like I’m being cheated. I am currently getting money stolen from me and I can’t get into the game because it keeps restarting. I want what is being taken from me back because I don’t keep that much money in my bank on any day.,Making me mad
3,2023-07-05 22:55:46,"Latest update brings lots of crashing, and pop ups that there is an error and the game must restart. Would be nice if it would work when it does restart, but instead we just repeat the process.",Errors!!!
3,2023-07-05 20:51:23,Love this game! But it’s been bugging out on me saying to restart the app cause of an error. Then I had to delete it and redownload it and it’s still doing the same thing. It won’t load last 30% and it’s frustrating :/,Love the game but has some bugs
1,2023-07-05 20:30:52,Game doesn’t load in pass 30% then says error has occurred game needs to restart only to do the same exact thing again. Basically I’ve downloaded this game on multiple devices and still haven’t got a chance to enjoy it. Really wanted to try it out but looks like I won’t be able to after all 😟,Game doesn’t load pass 30%
3,2023-07-05 19:12:13,I love playing Monopoly but they need daily updates. I keep getting kicked out the game and sometimes when I upgrade my addition houses won’t be on my board. Fix the minor problems and this would be a 5-star game.,Great game but too many problems
5,2023-07-01 01:01:21,Transferred all my apps and photos etc to new iPhone.  Well I got pretty far and spent some money on this game.  Just to go back to the beginning.  It’s not good.,New phone
5,2023-06-24 17:13:12,I love the game I have so much fun playing monopoly go than the board game and I can play this on my phone at anytime instead of getting the board game out and set it all up,Love the game
5,2023-06-23 23:46:48,Fun to play and expensive properties as you go through the boards. Thank goodness it is pretend money!  Wish there was an easy way to access the community chest,Fun to play!
5,2023-06-17 16:48:46,Literally just started playing because I got a invite from a friend mind you I’m not a big phone game player but I’m really enjoying it!,I’m liking it!
4,2023-06-13 20:24:57,"The time for rolls to recharge needs to be halved at least. There are also people you add as friends who target you repetitively, that should be reported or frowned upon. Not much reward in waiting an hour for 6 rolls.",Pay to play
4,2023-06-05 21:51:27,"I think it’s a very fun game and if people like the board game then I think they will really like Monopoly go. The reason why I put four stars is, it keeps giving me the same person over and over",My review on monopoly go

5,2023-05-04 01:32:33,Love the graphics and game play. Nice easy take on a classic board game. So far so good but I know my progress will slow down. ‘Twas ever thus! The building a city and “attacking” others is interesting. Good game.,"Fun, fast and noisy"

5,2023-10-30 14:40:26,I love the game it’s just the further into the game you get the harder it is to get stickers you need unless you spend a bunch of money !!,Monopoly ago
3,2023-11-10 22:07:19,"The game seems to be set to only give repeat cards for 1-3⭐️ and nothing higher, count yourself extremely lucky if you ever get a 5⭐️ or a gold card, which makes the game no fun. Speaking for myself, I will not spend any more money on this game.",Ridiculousness
2,2023-11-10 19:20:32,I love the game but I’ve been saving dice and playing the tournaments in order to get the gold star packs. I’ve been needing this one gold sticker happiness from the nessi pack and it just will not do it. It’s frustrating it’s one of the last packs I need to finish and it’s making me want to delete the game at this point.,Great game
4,2023-11-08 16:51:05,bruh takes like 3 minutes after i open the app i finally get to spin i don’t care about your in app purchases let me throw the dice,Too many pop ups
3,2023-11-06 16:56:21,I love the game but ever since I’ve updated and it keeps saying error when I go into the game and then it restart. Also when you suppose get rewards they don’t always give you the rewards your suppose get,Monopoly go
1,2023-11-05 13:37:27,Twice now I have bought extra dice and I have been over charged. The last time was supposed to be $20 and I was charged $50. I like the game but I will not be doing this again. I understand tax but $30 is not just tax!  Edit: I tried to contact customer support on the game and was told there was nothing they can do about it,Overcharging
3,2023-11-04 18:54:36,I’m on level 280 and All they give me is 1 and 2 star card packs not only that how is it I still only get 50 rolls for finishing a level and it cost 10 as much then someone just starting out ??? This is crazy!!,Something’s not right
4,2023-11-03 16:21:22,"This game is addicting it’s definitely for the competitive, but beware you’re going to lose friends or make people mad by winning 🤣🫶🏻",You’re going to have fun but lose friends 🤣
1,2023-11-01 17:11:25,Cant even play without it crashing every 3 minutes to achieve my ranking . Stickers are hard to obtain it's been 30 days and i still receive the same ones.  You're not going to achieve anything if you don't have a friend gifting you stickers. A few friends quit because of this and I'm about to join them.,Crashing
1,2023-10-30 18:48:34,"For almost a week this game has froze for long periods of times. I’ve lost out on rewards, dice and events. It is a all day thing and only a small period of time I can play!

1,2023-10-30 04:48:55,Scam scam scam!! Everyone is struggling with the partner event because yall wanted to be greedy! Ruined the only excitement the game had which is partnering. From 60K to 80K per car is insane! And you’re only offering a crumb of dice and a pink 3 star pack for completing one car that takes about 5K dice each! Cant wait until people start deleting and this app fails. Customer service is trash!,Don’t download
3,2023-10-29 20:08:03,It’s fun and I’ve been playing it for a minute now but when the tournaments are over sometimes u don’t get what u won I don’t know if it’s a bug or if it’s just the game but it doesn’t give me nothing at all other then that the game is fun and entertaining but YALL NEED TO FIX THAT‼️,Idk
3,2023-10-25 15:30:49,It’s fun. It can be addicting. It’s mainly pay to win. In my experience (although there’s plenty of luck involved) I’m not able to complete events or win them if I don’t pay to keep up with other people that are paying. 🤷🏻‍♂️.,It can be fun
5,2023-10-23 14:46:02,This is an all around great game.  But I hate how hard it is to trade with honest people. I tarde stickers with someone and never get what I need In return. It’s very sad I hop you can fix this,Scammers
5,2023-10-22 22:46:19,People think this game is a scam like normal adds and begging for money and just roll dice but actually it’s so much more than that so I recommend this have fun😜🤘🏽✌🏽,I 💖this game

1,2023-10-22 16:21:57,I have tried to contact customer service and just keep getting the runaround and excuses. I was supposed to win dice plus a sticker pack   I got the dice but not the sticker pack and their answer was some rewards run out of time. They were supposed to be rewarded together so how can one run out of time and not the other. Customer service is a joke.,Rewards rip off
5,2023-10-20 13:46:57,Monopoly goes such a fun game you can is like real monopoly in real life but on your phone or on your tablet on your computer it is so fun I really want other people to get this game😍😁,Monopoly go
4,2023-10-20 18:10:47,I love this game and the only reason I gave it four stars is because I play it so much I run out of dice real fast. So there’s nothing wrong with this game that’s just one of my pet peeves. And I do highly recommend this game!,Loved
5,2023-10-08 03:13:59,"It’s so addictive and fun. I literally play it everyday and I love targeting my friends, it’s hilarious. However, I’ve spent like real money to buy more dice and I need to stop doing that lol 😂😂. But i love this game!!",I love it
3,2023-10-16 12:14:21,"I love the game but it’s also extremely aggravating. You never get enough dice to actually play for very long. I’m not paying to play so I’ll probably delete it. Also, you give the same stickers over and over.",Fun but aggravating
4,2023-10-15 17:22:25,"Hi! So I got this game thinking it would be like the real board game, it’s not. I was really disappointed and also it cost kinda a lot of money. I did not understand how the game worked at all and doesn’t really make sense.",PLEASE READ BEFORE GETTING APP!

2,2023-10-06 19:21:16,Want to get stickers? Have fun getting the same ones 1000 times and not being able to get different ones even if you pay for them. What’s to point of playing if you can’t complete the boards? It’s a fun game but it sets you up to not pass or get prizes to get more dice!,Not Fair
5,2023-10-01 18:10:13,This game is so fun and addicting and i love that theres other people on here but it would be so fun if u could invite someone to play a round of monopoly with you,good game should add things
1,2023-10-03 15:47:35,This game has a lot of technical issues frequently. You pay money to buy dice and packs and make progress and then the system crashes and you lose all of your progress only to receive an apology and a couple hundred dice and random duplicate stickers which are useless! This is getting out of hand!,Technical issues
5,2023-09-29 02:40:05,"This became one of my favorite games, is easy to use and to understand but at the same e time is challenging of how to maintain your money and keep expanding but in a fun way.",Amazing game

1,2023-09-17 04:02:46,This game is fun with the exception of having to spend your money to succeed. Made it to the Old West level without spending personal money but suddenly the game has taken a dramatic turn. I refuse to spend money on a game and will keep to arcade from now on. It’s a shame because I love monopoly deal as a card game and hoped this would be similar. Hard no!,Worth it if you spend money
1,2023-09-11 20:24:43,They’re not giving the stickers as need. They constantly send the same stickers and when you trade them they send more back of the same stickers. Be careful they’re making it to were you have to pay to receive the stickers you need. Read what people are saying on other sites before paying.,Stickers

3,2023-09-04 03:46:59,Monopoly is a fun game but the loops we have to jump through to complete albums isn’t worth the prizes. The prize to complete a album should not start at 130 rolls! Be foreal. We have potential to win that daily. The album prizes should be much more elite. Please fix this.,Bigger rewards
5,2023-08-27 18:08:39,I started playing this game and before I knew it everyone I know is playing it. Sharing phone#’s and stories. Not just a game to play by yourself it’s a group game.,Awesome Fun!!!

I have needed 5 gold cards for over 3 weeks and wont be able to finish the album. Yall need to make it to where we can trade gold cards, or make it to where we cant get a duplicate of a gold card we have.",Hmmmm.
1,2023-08-30 18:04:18,You guys have us plenty of time to finish this album but made it incredibly difficult not giving us the cards we need not giving us new cards for weeks and not being able to trade gold cards. I’be been 9 cards away from completing this alum for a while month that’s ridiculous.,Stickers/ album completion
5,2023-08-27 00:32:26,"It’s great at taking your money! Anytime I have spare money, money that I could use to help the local homeless - this game takes it without an issue. Flawless!",This game is great!
4,2023-08-27 14:40:25,Like I said I love how much faster it is but I still wish there were less pop ups or at least an option to disable them.,Love how much faster it is
5,2023-08-23 08:35:06,You guys should really make it available to us at some point to be able to trade the gold cards.,Trading cards
4,2023-08-26 15:32:06,I gave it 4 stars because of the cards. It’s ridiculous how hard it is to get the golden cards and that they can’t be gifted or traded. Majority of the card packs have the duplicates of the same card.,Only 4 stars
3,2023-08-26 01:35:27,"I just feel like if we can’t trade gold cards then we shouldn’t be getting duped of gold cards Also why do I have 27 multiple of one card and a lot of multiples to where it’s like 11, 12 , 13 of the same cards but I get one new card like once a week  And if we can multiply our dice rolls , why do y’all think that 8 rolls an hour is reasonable?  I roll by the 20 so that’s not even one roll  I get y’all want us to pay but do y’all honestly think 4.99 for not even 100 dice is okay ? I really like the game but BE FAIR",Cards
3,2023-08-25 22:55:25,The game was great at first. Then we you get close to completing albums the algorithms are against you. They get you close then won’t let you get what need without spending. You have to be a scammer on Facebook to get there. I’m not giving this game another dime.,Stickers
4,2023-08-24 03:58:55,We should be able to send gold star stickers if we are same to send the other stickers. Also we should be able to gift dice.,Gold star stickers
5,2023-08-15 20:11:00,You don’t have to buy at the store and waste money and you don’t need to lose your pieces and  you don’t need to get people to play with you,Best game
1,2023-08-22 15:16:17,The game is fine but if you feel like purchasing something don’t I’ve purchased 4 bundles and did not get one. Yet I payed for it. When you contact customer service which it’s like no one’s time is free or have the time out of there day they just keep wanting more info on top of waiting 2-4 business days to chat with a bot and not a real person. DONT DO IT!!!!,Ccc
4,2023-08-22 01:24:02,"It’s addicting, but sometimes you are run out of dice rolls weight when you’re at the time when you’re like really into it so it’s kind of annoying",Addicting and not addicting
1,2023-08-20 03:04:44,This game is like one of the worse games like I’ve u guys give out the same stickers back to back because you want people to pay $20 for bundles and only get two new stickers. Otherwise you just clicking go and circling the board for days to weeks hoping to get one sticker that you actually need to complete an album,Starting to hate game
5,2023-08-15 01:44:17,"I didn’t think I would like it at first, but after finally trying it, I can’t seem to put it down!",Addictive and fun!
3,2023-08-14 21:26:05,"We have a large group playing and sharing stickers, working on cars and it’s fun. But it’s still too hard to get dice. Without dice you can’t play so it’s frustrating and now everyone wants to quit. It’s not going to be fun playing by myself",Monopoly
3,2023-08-13 22:03:51,I have been playing this game for almost 86 days and I still have not got all the cards there is only 17 days felt why are some of those cards so hard not happy about to just stop playing,Needs more work
5,2023-08-05 11:33:06,Best mobile game I’ve played in a while. I wish we can view our completed boards. The details in this game is immaculate!,Highly Addicting!!
3,2023-08-05 18:17:10,This game is fun overall the whole concept is great . It is hard to get spins in the game & impossible to get stickers . They need to make it where you can buy sticker packs like every other game does. Other than those things it’s a great game!,Fun overall
5,2023-07-23 13:59:38,It’s been so long since I’ve had fun playing a game on my phone. Love the fact that you play with people you know as well as random people. Love this game!,Love it!!!
4,2023-07-28 18:02:59,The game is great however I do feel like we’re being cheated if I have 10x the shields why do I lose a shield as soon as I get hit once that’s very misleading I should be able tk get hit 10x before I’m missing one shield,The game is great
3,2023-07-27 13:32:28,"I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. Here recently my screen has been filled up and cluttered with ads. In my honest opinion, if the ads went away, and more of the screen was revealed, the game would be even more enjoyable.",Descent game… too many ads
3,2023-07-27 11:37:56,I want to give 5 stars but it shouldn’t take an hr for the dices to refill. Then I keep getting the same cards when I’m only missing 3. It’s like it’s made for you to lose. It’s very repetitive even after the update. Please fix,The amount of time
4,2023-07-27 07:31:39,I love the game overall it’s the best but you need to work on with sticker cards since everybody are fed up with scams card trade and people refuse to give away or trade them. We rarely get any new ones,Stickers issues
1,2023-07-25 17:05:12,"I’m not usually one to complain, but I won 1st place on the s’mores challenge. I literally was on my game until the last second, and it said I was 1st place. When I get my reward, I get the 2nd place reward. That’s not right. I spent actual money trying to stay in 1st place. I’m a little bit perturbed and would love either my money back I spent or the correct reward.",S’mores challenge

5,2023-07-22 04:55:46,I am now addicted and I’m in fb groups trading stickers 🤣 it’s a fun and way different experience to the original Monopoly!,Downloaded originally to see what the hype was about
5,2023-07-21 23:04:20,I think it’s really fun and it is very easy to play and they make the game fun by giving you lots of free stuff so you can continue having fun,My experience in Monopoly Go
5,2023-07-20 19:26:56,They need to up the amount of dives given after finishing a board 50 isn’t cutting it would be nice to have more dices as you level up.,Dice
5,2023-07-17 10:23:39,Love playing the game! Like landing on the railroads spaces! Reminded me how it made me excited when I was a young tyke!!! You’ll love the memories it brings back when you were a kid too😁,A new “ROLL” on an old classic!!
2,2023-07-20 01:59:32,It’s a great board game but however I’m starting to think the game is hacked. Due to one individual whom isn’t added on my friend list is able to attempts to shut down my property more the 4 times. As well as when I revenged back the game errors and kicks me out. Can this issue be fixed?.,Shut Down Attempts
5,2023-07-09 23:33:08,I don’t know why but I LOVE this game!!! Me and my friends be up for HOURSSSS rolling these darn dice 🤣🤣🤣! I can say though…. with each city we unlock we should get more rolls back because 50 don’t do nothing lol.,Shook!
3,2023-07-15 17:01:55,"Either let us trade gold stickers or stop giving them in duplicates, another thing I feel like the further you move in the game the completion of set wheel should be better not the same lame prizes and bring the baking cake back please!",Please fix!!
2,2023-07-11 14:43:31,"If you want a Monopoly game with no downside, this is your game.   Money is too easy to obtain and the downside is virtually nonexistent.

You’re all special - just like everyone else.  Good job sport.  LOL!",Just a time killer… not much more
3,2023-07-11 01:14:59,"Very Fun Game Very Enjoyable!! An being that it’s online gaming is pretty Amazing Too!!

1,2023-07-09 03:18:50,"This game is a total scam. From ongoing “bugs” which prevent the game from working properly, to the software “glitches” that wipe out all your accumulated money and dice rolls, the only real purpose of this game is to get users to purchase additional money and dice rolls. After multiple complaints and attempts to get some resolution from Scopely and Monopoly GO, I’ve given up and I am spreading the word about this game.",Scam!
5,2023-07-07 07:58:55,The only thing I don’t like is this game doesn’t keep giving me my free ones every hour even when I bought some rolls and that’s not cool,Great game
5,2023-07-03 18:16:18,It’s a game where you can play monopoly online so you can play in the car is the best you should get it if you don’t have it,It’s perfect and I love it
1,2023-07-07 00:13:49,"The game has been crashing a lot recently. It was better this morning and I got a lot of accomplishments. Later in the day it crashed again and I lost all the progress I had gotten (which was a lot). The issue still hasn’t been fixed. I was about to earn 1,500 rolls and it completely erased that.

4,2023-07-04 21:27:48,I like the monopoly ascetic and the way the game works. The games free so if you want it but are a little low on cash it’s a good game for you. The game isn’t like online Monopoly but the game still works in a fun way. I openly recommend you try it!,Great little toon game
5,2023-06-29 16:45:13,"Honestly, I was never a fan of the board game but this is a game changer for me. I love it. Love everything about it. Can’t get enough of it. There’s not one thing I dislike about it.",Game changer! 🎲

4,2023-06-27 20:49:16,I love monopoly!  The game is great. I like the fact that you don’t have to look at 10 different options to buy when you’re low on coins. People trading are very nice although I haven’t gotten a trade yet.,Monopoly Rules!!
4,2023-06-27 16:34:28,I love this game but I think they should let us gift rolls to friends and at least be able to gift one Gold Sticker a day.  Another recommendation is that we be able to just purchase sticker packs.,Best Game Ever!!
4,2023-06-20 02:38:33,I just started playing this game last week and it’s good but I haven’t figured out everything. So this review could be useless for other people. This game overall is fun just like the real game.,I like it!

3,2023-05-30 00:10:10,You have to wait like an hour to get 5 rolls making it unplayable to just sit down and play you are forced to keep coming back or spend a ridiculous  amount of money daily. Other than that it’s a pretty good gam though.,Almost good
5,2023-05-06 17:16:02,"Super awesome. I thought it was gonna be lame but I’m constantly craving more rolls. With me knowing the actual strategy when it comes to dice probabilities, it becomes an actual addictive strategy game. I love it.",Awesome monopoly go

1,2023-09-27 01:45:44,The amount of dice you get is so little. The albums are harder to close because they all have a gold card and the amount of dice given for each sticker album closed is a joke. They want you to buy the packs to get dice. You get so many duplicate cards even gold ones that can not be traded. They do not care about the users at all.,Super Money hungry

Customer service said they have to confirm my identity before deleting my account and who knows how long that is going to take.,Fun to irritating

1,2023-09-21 22:35:34,This game was fun to start with.  I broke my number one rule and spent money on this game.  I enjoy playing but it has become boring and you cannot get ahead in the game unless you spend money for dice.  I have only been playing for a boy 2 months but now I am leaving.  Players beware.  There are plenty of apps and games that do not cost like this one,Refuse to spend more money
2,2023-09-20 16:14:26,"Monopoly has all these people playing and wants us to pay all that money for dice.. it’s getting hard to get a lot of dice and the prizes are starting to get hard to get unless you spend money. Also, it should not take this long to get GOLD stickers! It’s not like the prizes are big.",Not fun anymore
1,2023-09-20 05:09:49,Devs don’t care about the casual player. No chance at beating challenges unless you play all day everyday (and then you still don’t win). Also you can spend days  saving up some money and have one player take it all in one go. I could go into detail but the devs dont care as evidenced by their updates that make it worse.,Better Be Hardcore
4,2023-09-20 01:51:08,i looooooove this game but there’s some strangers and you and others might get hacked by hackers in this game that’s why i don’t even play this one time but you guys should play this its really fun 🤩 and cool 😎  By: peanut butter cutie😍🥜,There are many strangers in this game🫣
1,2023-09-19 11:58:33,"I’m slightly irritated! This entire game plus customer support is a JOKE. I’ve spent numerous amounts of money on this game just for them to strip me of ALL my tokens & instead of rightfully returning them, they gave me 70 dice and a little bit of money on my Monopoly account! Get real. I’m deactivating this app! Oh & customer service takes WEEKS to get back to you. Do not waste your time nor money! Good riddance.",What a JOKE!
1,2023-09-18 10:29:21,"The game is good and very addictive don’t get me wrong but the amount of money and time I’ve put in the game just for me to go from level 6,000 something to 0 and support hasn’t got back to me in a week is ridiculous.

1,2023-09-14 04:18:27,"It’s the most money hungry game I have EVER played. It’s all good at first, then you start rise in levels and you only get 50 dice NO MATTER what level you are. For ex: I am on property level 112 I need a minimum of $48 million to complete one little bubble out of over 30. After you complete one the next double in price. The invite a friend is NOT accurate either. They are very very VERY greedy.",DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT

1,2023-09-12 02:39:18,It was super fun when I stared playing. But now not so much. The dice for completing an album is lower and it’s so much harder to complete sets and get dice. I’ve noticed when I get ppl to join I don’t get the 100 dice as promised either. I’m about ready to delete the game and so are all my friends. Y’all better make it fun again or we are out !!! Quit being greedy!!!! Seriously!,Not as fun

4,2023-09-10 13:46:10,Very fun and addicting game! I recommend them adding a better in game trading system that ensures both parties can confirm or deny the cards they’re receiving so that card scamming can get under control,Fun! Trading needs work tho

3,2023-09-08 11:02:15,Coo game jus don’t like the fact that when u get a chance  or what for money or dice and u are playing a high bid they don’t multiply it by what u paying because if I’m playing x50 and I get a price of money or dice they do not xtines it by that I wish y’all would fix that,Game
1,2023-09-08 14:16:38,"I’m starting to get annoyed to the point where I will delete this game. Why is it that one person can repeatedly attack me and use me to open their community chest, but they are not on my friend’s list and I can’t retaliate. We should be able to block people like that.  Also, the amount of dice we receive for completing a set in the album is laughable.",FIX THIS GLITCH

5,2023-09-06 18:34:40,I love playing but my husband wants me to stop with the $1.99 here and $2.99 there. Wish you could get more dice free and cards too. But overall it’s a great game.,So much fun!
5,2023-09-04 23:58:43,It’s the best game I play in a while because I don’t like lots of game but this is the one u should it I have no words for it just get it and see,How much I love monopoly go
2,2023-09-06 13:16:19,-This app will “credit” you stickers that you worked for only for them to NOT go to your album. -You roll a certain a number on the dice and your piece does NOT move those number of spaces. -When you get a pick pack of stickers & it promises you a minimum of a certain sticker it LIES,This game cheats you
4,2023-09-06 02:32:38,"My only gripe is the same as many others. If we are unable to trade gold cards, we should not have the option to acquire multiples of the same gold cards.",Fun and Addictive Game

5,2023-09-01 02:45:03,Me and my son enjoy playing this version of monopoly. It has been a great work! We love it!! Definitely recommend to try out and play.,This is very fun!! 🤩
1,2023-09-01 09:30:35,The game is a bit ridiculous. You won’t get anywhere without spending money. This album has made that even more obvious. Apparently the millions they’ve already made wasn’t enough. I get the whole point is to make money. But when you can’t really play the game without spending it it’s not worth it.,It’s fun but a very obvious cash grab
5,2023-09-01 01:48:43,There are no adds so it makes it even better and you get to have heists and put people out of bisnnes,No adds
5,2023-08-27 23:11:13,Been playing this game to help stay sober and it’s working I have 15 months sober and am on level 70 and still going. Thank you MonopolyGO!,Level 70 and still loving it

With 2nd and the rest being no where even close. Seems like the creators dont really care to look into it.",Cheaters ruin the game.
1,2023-08-30 18:50:46,They make it extremely difficult to earn new stickers. They constantly will give you stickers you already have even when you earn enough stars to exchange they scam you and still give you cars you already have. They purposely aren’t letting you when probably scamming so people can pay for rolls,Stickers are a scam
2,2023-08-30 18:49:53,It’s a fun game and I have enjoyed playing it but the rewards and dice get to a point that don’t match up to your level/board. I spent over a week on the same board because of how difficult it is once you get to a certain point. A bit ridiculous,Gets pointless
1,2023-08-28 13:36:13,Since the most recent update .. The last 2 to 3 times I’ve opened the community chest it has crashed.. and literally stayed frozen until I go back in and it just goes to Home Screen.. BAD ENOUGH it’s so hard to get new stickers it loses the chances of me even having the chance to get a purple pack sticker.. I think it should be fixed asap..,Update :/
5,2023-08-27 03:21:00,I have a love/hate for this game! It can be frustrating and annoying at times but I just keep playing.,Very addictive
2,2023-08-27 21:06:50,I have been playing Go Monopoly for a while and have completed several events and received several tokens and they are no longer showing in my showroom. I had 12 and all of them are gone! It glitched out and now everything is gone.,My tokens disappeared
4,2023-08-27 13:08:12,I only have one complaint so far! Where the heck are the “Get out of jail free cards?” I mean it’s crazy expensive to get out of jail. Please put these on chance or make it an event to land on like Cash Grab! 😬😬,I have a request!
2,2023-08-26 03:51:45,"Well first i’m mad that I made a purchase in the game and it never came through.  And there is like no EASY way to get ahold of these people.

1,2023-08-26 12:07:10,I once loved this game. After having almost all my cards i was missing just one so i paid for the missing star package. I never received it.

1,2023-08-26 00:14:54,Next time I download a game I’ll make sure cards/stickers aren’t needed for it. The real problem isn’t just getting scammed out of cards but you can’t even trade the gold ones and there doesn’t seem to be enough of 4star and 5 star cards/stickers to go around. Everyone is looking for the same cards all the time. I’m over this game!!!,It’s ok. Not what I had hoped for
5,2023-08-20 13:21:03,This new version of Monopoly is fun and exciting. Definitely different but in a good way. I wish you earned more spins an hour though. I don’t pay to play.,It’s fun

3,2023-08-20 13:02:46,I count the number of spots that the piece moves on the board and it does not always match the number that you rolled on the dice.  Very frustrating when you are trying to make progress on the board to earn rewards.,Spots moved and dice rolled don’t match

So let me get this straight… we can’t choose where the houses go, we have limited dice rolls, any money earned from the board is spent on a completely pointless “city” which will totally wipe your progress once all buildings are upgraded so you can go to the next city…  So what are we working towards? As a free player, I can already see how spenders will be invincible against your attempts to…. Hurt(?) their buildings if you happen to land on the space that allows you to try and loot others.  But why are we looting others? For money? To upgrade our buildings in order to wipe it all again?  Super disappointed.",Why this?

1,2023-09-20 14:12:22,The new update is terrible I wish you guys would just go back to the way it was. Not to mention the when we get to the higher levels and complete a bored we should tart getting more than 50 rolled and more rolls as a prize the money is cool but we are making it all through the game so we have tones of money but no rolls.,The New update
1,2023-09-20 12:52:31,"They will cheat you out of rewards, not respond to customer service tickets, and barely give you dice.   The only way to succeed at this game is to buy dice and I’m not giving my hard earned money to a game that should be free to play (for more than 5 mins a day) with the OPTION to buy rewards.

They make it so you have to purchase your last remaining cards… and for me to do so it would cost $100. Are you kidding me? That’s like groceries for at least a week. For a game…   I think they prey on venerable people with addictive personalities.   Just stay away from this game. Everything about it, is to try and get money from you.",Giant scam

No thanks.   3) when you win a heist or shutdown, only a portion of the winnings actually show up in your bank.  4) I won events and had prizes that never showed up.   5) gold cards should be able to be traded  Outside of that, the game is great!",Great games but still has some bugs

3,2023-08-19 05:06:20,The app needs a few bug updates. You can rob a bank & then the money goes nowhere. You can use multipliers then nothing is multiplied when you land on other things. It is a fun game but needs improvements,Bugs
2,2023-08-18 18:40:59,I wish they would stop with POPUPS and hurry up with the cards and the money when you get it.  Really  annoying when you have to sit there and wait for it and keep tapping the screen.    Stop with the POPUPS that are wanting you to buy something every second.,Pop-ups

3,2023-07-18 04:48:05,The game itself is good. It will pass the time by and adding friends make it more fun. But the game cheats you out of your rolls. You already have to wait an hour to get five rolls. You roll one time you can go from 10 to 7 rolls left.,Monopoly go cheats out of rolls
4,2023-07-16 20:50:53,I love this game. It’s so addictive. But after putting time and money into it and get so far it’s annoying to be scammed out of cards by people. How do we or can we report them?,Love this game however

2,2023-07-05 19:45:22,My biggest issue with the game is that dice cost to much. I shouldn’t have to spend $100 real money to get 3600 dice. That’s ridiculous. Stamps are also way harder to get than they should be. At least new ones. I’ve gotten over 800 stamps this season that I’ve already gotten 1 or 2 of. That’s way ridiculous.,Game

1,2023-06-14 06:25:42,The game itself is a blast and I have zero complaints about that part.   But the thing that kills me is the amount of pop ups in this game. There are times that there will be 5-7 different things I have to close out of before I can even do things like collect the daily bonus. It’s beyond annoying.   Do better Hasbro.,So. Many.

3,2023-04-15 21:33:50,I would have given the game 5 stars except for the fact you only get 5 rolls every hour. So you play for 30 seconds wait an hour and play for 30 more seconds.,Watching the clock to play
2,2023-11-10 15:34:24,No new stickers unless you pay for a package and even then you get the same sticker. Sometimes my multiplier doesn’t work on chance anymore I haven’t gotten a new shield forever.,No new stickers unless you pay for a package you keep getting the same stickers
5,2023-11-01 17:17:18,Good game when it wants to work but it keep popping up error and have to restart game consistently,Error

1,2023-11-02 21:53:04,"It seems like the more you try to fix something, the more you guys mess it up somehow. The last tournament was full of problems, but then you decided to compensate people for the problems. Great idea. Some people: awesome compensation, some: ehhh, and some not at all. At least be consistent with it for crying out loud. Just SMDH",Seriously? Full of glitches and inconsistencies
2,2023-11-02 12:08:35,"I’ve given this app enough of my time.   There’s no way to communicate with “friends” in the app.  No nudge or reminders for people you pick up from Facebook chat.    The build it games are far too short of a time.  Especially if you try to build alone.    I know there must be some sort of strategy, but at what cost?   Developers should fix so many redundant cards.  Lose the golden cards.  Swap cards with only with people you know.    I liked this game at first, but even the boards are repeats.  Gonna leave game and go bankrupt.  😟",Wretched “game”

Literally zero and the count down clock just started. I deleted it after all of this. Plus the constant add spend it over kill.,Customer support and glitches
3,2023-10-30 14:16:49,Why do we keep getting the same stickers . Will never be able to complete if we don’t get new stickers . I went 3 weeks without a new one . I pay a lot for extra rolls and still nothing.,Stickers
2,2023-10-29 18:29:36,"After a while it becomes obviously clear that the game is just designed for you to spend money. You’re given the bare minimum dice; repetitive stickers and it feels the only way to advance is to drop serious money. It’s a fun game, but it quickly grows aggravating.",The fun coincides with your wallet.
2,2023-10-28 14:01:03,In the beginning this game was really fun. As you level up it naturally becomes increasingly harder but it’s turned into a plum joke after board 90. It’s nothing but a game that wants you to spend money and will make it almost impossible to do anything if you don’t.,Not worth it
1,2023-10-29 04:11:22,"This game is no longer fun. It’s extremely rigged and just overall full of crap. Be fair to the people who keep this game active! Let us trade gold cards regularly, stop being stingy with the dice. Why only 50 dice no matter what level you get to?! This car event going on is so rigged as well. Y’all made it twice as hard to finish it! Stop the crap scopely",Game is rigged

3,2023-10-23 19:13:59,"It’s really fun and addicting, but very frustrating that there are so many repeats with the stickers. It shouldn’t be made THAT hard to find some of them. It’s fun no matter what, but made too hard to complete certain tasks.",Fun but repetitive

1,2023-10-22 17:35:26,This game cheats you. I rolled a 5 while I was on GO!!! It landed me 1 before the railroad. If I rolled a 5 I should have landed on a railroad.  I have video and picture proof!!! If I was on boardwalk then the cowboy token would have been removed! It cheats you to make u need to spend money to get ahead and win! When in reality we all could win if the game was played fair.,This game will cheat you!!!
2,2023-10-21 12:15:26,"Started out fun but it has now become boring and frustrating to some. Acquiring stickers and dice smdh, what a task….it’s a waste to spend your money…duplication of stickers are unbelievable not to forget some players don’t have integrity when it comes to trading stickers!","Save your time, energy and money"
4,2023-10-21 02:00:50,Sometimes when I use dice links they won’t add dice to my game even though it tells me I get them. And when I click out of it I can’t use the game unless I restart.,Dice links
5,2023-10-12 05:19:24,Too many pop ups after you run out of rolls. Rather have a dice drop than a cash drop,Needs a Dice Drop
2,2023-10-19 20:41:40,"The game seems fun and innocent, at first. It spams micro transactions at you CONSTANTLY in the form of notifications and in game on your screen, and I was even willing to ignore that.  Then I figured out how the game uses bots to attack you to keep you playing, and hopefully buying. There’s also bot accounts YOU will attack with all torn up boards, that somehow ALWAYS have shields to prevent you from getting money as much without paying.   If you research the company, you’ll see this is not their first overly predatory mobile game.   All in all, still not the worst game ever.",Super predatory
1,2023-10-18 23:12:27,I am friends with this person on the game. I use to be able to switch opponents on knock downs and hit his buildings multiple times and now he’s not on my list anymore but he can still knock down all of buildings. I’m still on his board where he collect rent and do bank heist but he isn’t on mine.,Friends not showing up on my friends list
1,2023-10-13 10:14:28,Probably of the most rigged games in the world. If you don’t have a lot of money I do not recommend this game you do any kind of advancing or to complete anything or to even get a small little token you want you have to spend money to get it. Absolutely horrible learn to make a game that’s not rigged and actually based off of randomization,#1 most rigged game
5,2023-10-11 11:41:42,"I love this game and it’s perfect for the family. So I recommend you get it. Also no Ads! I’m sure your struggling to find a perfect game, but this that game",No ADS!

1,2023-10-05 06:22:30,"This game has consistent issues the creators only address about a quarter of them and even when they do the issues continue to happen later on. It will also charge you more, sometimes double, than any purchases you make in the app.","Constantly glitches, steals money"
2,2023-10-05 01:42:59,1.I did not receive my 300 puzzle pieces  2 I have also noticed that the game will bypass spaces that you need when rolling and you won’t even collect rent. It’s just going to empty spaces just to take up your dice. I love playing monopoly as a child  this game has a lot of issues,Never received puzzle pieces and dice rolls
1,2023-10-05 00:29:09,The game is hyper repetitive after the initial novelty wears off. The roll generator is not actually random so the game will land on tiles that keep you just under any achievement that nets you rolls. The sticker system is fixed so completion is impossible without spending real money. Not only is it a pay to win but also a pay to even try and enjoy,Monotonous cash grab
3,2023-10-03 16:43:46,How do I get a bug fixed? My partner tournament keeps resetting without showing progress. Each time I build and reload the app the progress is not saved and I have to keep starting over,No progress

2,2023-10-03 11:20:34,This game use to be fun. But the sticker game is horrible. You can not receive gold stars I refuse to spend money on a game let alone a free game.  The amount of dice you get daily is way to low to complete competitions.  It is def a rigged game. The glitch in the dice roll is horrible. I’m to the point I’m about to delete the game.,Overall
3,2023-10-02 16:10:21,"It doesn’t make sense to gift the same stickers all the time. You have 10gold stickers that can’t be gifted to a friend, but you never receive any new gold sticker. It’s stupid. I just play when I’m bored. It’s not fun anymore",Overall

2,2023-08-20 12:54:13,I deleted the monopoly go app It’s unplayable on the higher level without in app purchases  Constantly taking all your earn money as you wait that’s not fun. Feel like you’re being penalized because you don’t pay.,Higher levels not playable without in app purchase

4,2023-08-07 18:11:54,it get extremely hard to get the stickers you need to complete a album when you’ve gotten to the point where you’ve collected all the stickers in the albums without gold stickers so when you get stickers for albums you’ve completed it gets annoying bc i’m constantly getting stickers that i already have and very rarely do i get a card i need,stop giving sticker in completed packs
5,2023-07-31 21:39:05,Fun game in general but what makes it great is if you are competitive and have friends and family to play with however games stingy with dice so use it wisely,Great game

2,2023-07-25 03:34:02,"MonopolyGO’s gameplay structure is no different than to that of slot machine games. You roll dice to earn money, you build your town, have side quests, all with no ultimate goal.   It’s nothing but dopamine hit after dopamine hit. Eventually building your town gets so expensive that you’ll have to pay to roll dice.  Read that again. You will feel the need to pay for dice rolls for gameplay that will NEVER satisfy you.   Games like this are telling of how our society has shifted through mobile games and how companies are profiting from us.",Fun But Eventually Boring

This last event i was 1st i was supposed to get 1500 dice and over 250mil and sticker packs. When the event was over nothing happened. I also spent 20 on this game and it never paid out the dice but it took the money from my account.,Monopoly

1,2023-07-10 11:26:09,I don’t think this game is fun anyone. I’m taking my game methods elsewhere ! The higher you go the harder it is to win. It’s impossible to complete the tasks because they never give you enough dice. When it’s clearly impossible to win if you play low on dice. It’s only fun when you have more than enough dice to play big. I now rate this game a 2/10.,Rip Off

2,2023-06-27 16:10:13,The reason I gave the app a low rating is because it’s almost NOTHING alike the actual game! There are so many rules and it’s just really confusing. The graphics however are flawless! I like how you can earn new game tokens but I just wish the game was more simple and more like the original. Thanks!,🚨PLS READ🚨
3,2023-06-19 21:03:04,I very much enjoy playing this game! I play it nonstop! My only complaint is the wait time on dice! An hour for only 5 rolls is a little to much for me. I would rate this 5+ if that were not the case. Please lower the wait time! It’s a little to much!!,Long wait time

5,2023-05-07 03:48:22,It’s a fun game gives a twist to your usually monopoly game I just give it a 1 star because referrals do not work. I’ve already referred 4friends and received no rewards for doing so,Fun but
5,2023-05-06 18:45:28,This game is actually really fun. It not like the normal monopoly game where you roll and that it. You keep going and keep building things in the game. Really fun,Not what I was expecting
5,2023-04-28 12:55:48,I just left the board game and now I can play it on my phone and it's a little bit different so that's the best thing about this game. Totally five stars.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,monopoly
1,2023-05-05 14:07:32,"This game is literally trash. (Do not recommend)  It’s NOTHING like monopoly it’s just a rolling dice game that just took some monopoly items and used them at their own advantage (you can’t play with friends, you can’t buy property, literally NO SKILL required just computer automated rolls, and fake bots) don’t be fooled like me.

3,2023-10-29 11:51:59,The game would be great if it didn’t constantly skip over when you won a tournament. I have refreshed the app many times and have been rewarded and bad glitching as well. It needs to be updated again.,Eh
4,2023-10-24 19:02:54,I’d love to see it a little bit more easier to get Good Stickers and maybe 20 or even 50 dice an hour. 8 is hardly enough to get around the board even once.,Fun addictive game

4,2023-09-29 12:02:04,I can’t always see the dice.  I’d really like to but it either gets cut off or a tiny head is in the way.  Hope you all can adjust this 😊.  Does anyone ever earn money on here?,Dice

5,2023-09-26 00:46:34,Best game of all times now you can play in your phone …with others from all around the world,Monopoly
2,2023-09-28 19:10:53,After playing the game for a week it no longer loads and says that there is a connection issue when I have full service and Wi-Fi. It was a good game until you can’t play it anymore. All other games I have work just fine.,Not connecting
4,2023-09-28 18:26:38,The game will not open today and it is giving a server error. Was an update pushed and it’s having issues?,Server issues?
1,2023-09-28 18:13:39,"I understand updates and all but I’ve spent so much money on this game for it to completely not work. It was amazing but as time goes on there seems to be more problems and delays or not even loading, double charges etc… hopefully something gets fixed soon.",Not working at all today
2,2023-09-28 17:06:44,"I started playing not too long ago, everything was fine until yesterday. The app won’t move pass the loading screen and keeps timing out. Don’t know what’s going on the app is updated this needs to get fixed.",Not working
1,2023-09-28 15:58:54,I can run thru 2000 rolls and not get one gold card even a one gold star card let’s not even talk about 4 or 5 star cards ..game doesn’t even open and people are robbing and destroying landmarks and I can’t even access the game please developers make sure yall fix these issues and I refuse to buy anything it’s a waste of time,Repetitive cards
4,2023-09-28 15:12:23,very fun game but the issues it has gets annoying. there’s always something wrong and it never opens. Something needs to be done,Fun but Bad App Issues
1,2023-09-28 13:13:41,When I first started playing I feel like the prizes we worth it and finishes a sticker set you got a lot of dice for the hard work and now it’s so hard to get anything done and the rewards and prizes are so small for how much dice you have to use. Unless you wanna spend atleast 50 dollars of actual money a day it’s not worth getting into,It’s a trap
3,2023-09-28 08:13:33,I’ve loved this game but lately every time I open up my map or try to collect my quick wins an error message pops up saying that there was an unexpected error and it resets itself … it’s so annoying,Glitching
5,2023-09-25 00:11:55,It is a fun game but the gold cards should be easier to get besides having to spend your own money.,Monopoly Go
5,2023-09-22 00:28:29,I used to love this game but once I done the latest update it will not let me play it!!! So frustrating,Thumbs down
1,2023-09-24 14:37:17,This game started over fun but now it’s more of a disappointment. No matter how much time you work on your board you hardly ever get new cards. Saving up 2500 stars only to get 1 new card was a complete waste of time. 8 rolls every hour makes no sense when it takes you over 80 billion to build a new city.,Disappointed
2,2023-09-23 12:07:44,"I have 5 sets in need of GOLD stickers ONLY to complete and other sets in need of both.  Over the last few weeks, all I get are duplicates whether packs or exchange vaults.  Even wasted money in hopes of getting these stickers.  This game is becoming more and more a waste of my time.  Seems to be completely RIGGED!!",GAME IS RIGGED AND GREATLY FLAWED
5,2023-09-20 09:44:14,Going to delete it,Needs fixing not working properly
1,2023-09-21 01:25:59,Way to hard to get gold cards and even any card over 3 star. Have yet to get more than 3 4/5 star cards and when I do it’s the same one over and over. Tournaments shouldn’t allow random ppl to face you and then them cheat to get the first prize. Have had way to many issues since I started playing,Bad updates
4,2023-09-20 19:20:30,"Chance card rewards are not multiplying, no matter the dice roll. Makes it almost not worth it. A bug fix would be nice",1 MAJOR issue right now
5,2023-09-19 19:53:45,Hey. Just updated. Not getting credit for duplicate stickers.  Also. Don’t see where the shield upgrades is.,New update
1,2023-09-20 02:31:57,"It seems like scopely is intentionally killing this game. They lowered the dice for rewards, compared to last season, and the previous one. And now they have saturated the game with useless cosmetics like shield decorations. They refused to give the players what they actually want or anything near but continuously just try to grab money. Just don’t play this anymore.",They’re killing the game
1,2023-09-16 21:44:18,They give you 7 rolls per hour with unreasonable goals.   Then they max you at 80 dice you can’t continue to earn dice or build.   THIS GAME IS THE BIGGEST SCAM. You can literally spin hundreds of dollars on this game to come up empty.  May advise do not download this game unless you are willing to pay you hard earned money to play because 8 spins an hour is nothing.,Free to play is a JOKE
5,2023-09-16 13:59:14,I grew up playing monopoly and to have this on my mobile device and play as I go is just AWESOME!!! Thank you to whoever came up with the idea. It is keeping me entertained.,LOVING IT!!
5,2023-09-15 21:07:01,Get nothing but duplicates all the time even when trading the stars. Game is good other than that.,Need to Fix the stickers
5,2023-09-13 02:07:53,Excellent to play and able to invite others. Play with friends and others.,Love this app
1,2023-09-14 00:30:05,"Just a big money grab. It will be fun for about 1-2 days. After that, you’ll either need to spend money, or it will just be an extremely boring game because you will only be able to roll the dice twice every hour. Very very boring.  The app bombards you with pop ups to buy more dice, etc.  super greedy company. Could be a very fun game",Money grab
1,2023-09-13 23:57:26,Game has so Many glitches and when you land on things and you win the game doesn’t give it to you. Than you can write support a million times about all the things your missing and they still don’t assist. This game was fun when I first downloaded it but now me as well as a lot others seeing this game for what it is a SCAM!,Rigged and unfair
5,2023-09-11 02:56:59,Fun game.. but this new sticker change is wack. I can’t finish eight sets because all the sets require a gold card plus we get less dice. That’s trash.,Boooo!
1,2023-09-13 00:33:04,"I would like this game, but it rubs me the wrong way like it’s designed for you to loose or spend money instead of having fun. I been playing for some time and I was enjoying it but then it started to get ridiculous! Collecting points is harder so you barely can win point’s cause it’s almost impossible to land on and spots. 1300 for just 700 dice",Ugh
3,2023-09-11 21:21:56,"Has cheated a lot of people out of cookies and dices this tournament I believe something should be done about this, maybe a free gift for everyone too get. Some people that completed all four cakes didn’t even get their prizes!!",Please see soon
1,2023-09-11 20:50:34,"I loved this game until this Choco Partners event. It was nice of you to give everyone 400 free cookies for your mistake but that didn’t even cover the amount I should have had! If I would’ve gotten the amount I landed on I could’ve easily finished my last cake that only needed 8,300 more to be complete. This game has become more aggravating than fun anymore.",Aggravating

5,2023-09-10 22:52:07,"Soooo much fun but beware… this game is soooo much fun, I can’t stop playing! Also, knowing that there is a monetary award down the line makes it even more addictive  lol🤑",Addictive
1,2023-09-10 23:37:19,It was fun when I first started playing. Attack friends. Rob people. Complete that challenges. Now monopoly go makes it so difficult to complete any task/challenges. Unless you are spending your life savings on this game it is no fun to play. Save your time and money playing this game until they make this game fun again. THEY GOT GREEDY AND NOW YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY!!!,Monopoly made it no fun
5,2023-09-10 13:56:00,"Devs if u see this, please add this feature to the game. You know if you run it of dice it’s hard to get dice right?  I want a feature that u can gift dice in game. Sincerely Ayden",Devs please add this to the game

3,2023-09-07 19:21:35,It’s a fun game but it glitches when getting stuff for tournaments and don’t always get them. You waste so many dice trying to play and it skips over everything forcing you to buy dice to continue to play.,Fun game but……
1,2023-09-05 00:49:49,"I thought it’s gonna be better changes in this new album but NO. Less rewards and every set needs a golden card to complete. Also, golden card is still not tradeable then why give us duplicates? I will delete this app after use up those dice that I saved up from completing the last album",Disappointed
4,2023-09-04 01:13:30,"Love the game and it flows well. Only issue is when I’m playing on my 11 inch iPad Pro, the screen won’t rotate to landscape mode. Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars.",Only one problem…
1,2023-09-04 12:50:37,We get less dice with this new album. There is a gold sticker in EVERY album that you still can’t trade. You still only get 50 dice for completing a board. Not to mention only getting 8 dice an hour. This game is money hungry and ALOT of people will stop playing if things don’t change. There are ALOT of complaints out there,New album is trash
1,2023-09-02 13:37:45,"I have tried contacting their customer service a solid 6 times now about items I never got, missing rewards, my friend invites are not getting updated despite how many people I sent the link to.

3,2023-08-31 07:04:47,Very big on paying to complete the sets and games or forcing you to trade with randos who just scam cards from each other. Would be nice if it had achievable goals without the scams and without paying $20+,Pay to play
1,2023-08-29 03:47:44,This game needs a better customer service. I went to buy the 99$ bundle of dice and sticker packs and it charge me three time without even giving me the product for the first one. I’m very disappointed and would like for the game to fix. I’ve spent 3 days now trying to get ahold of them to fix it and no answer,Purchase issue

1,2023-08-27 05:15:08,"This game works against the player like a casino. There is no point to it, except to collect ‘stickers.’ There is no benefit to leveling up.

If you do purchase ‘dice,’ the algorithm puts you at a disadvantage, so that you are more likely to continue to purchase in-game items.",Game is worse than a casino
3,2023-08-27 03:30:37,I just feel like the wait time is insane to get just 5 dices like they could atleast make it 30 minutes or add more dices like 15 so atleast we could keep playing because people will just get bored of the wait time and uninstall the game.,Dices
1,2023-08-26 02:18:27,Im confused on why a set and the amount giving to the people is different on the accounts ? I pay money for this game and you telling me i get less dice when I complete a set over some who aint paid nothing !!!! I feel like every should get the same amount of dice when completing a set of card !!!!  Its a ripe off and i need my money back,Stealing dice

You can’t trade gold cards, the max dice is ridiculous, the amount of dice received after finishing a board is sad, people scamming for stickers, now they selling stickers or eBay.

3,2023-08-14 13:41:38,The only reason I gave it 3 stars because why you always have to purchase something to continue playing. Can we get a game we don’t have to make a purchase on? But I’ll gladly wait my hr to play every time,I like the game

Stop giving so many duplicates when there are stickers we actually need.  4). Every colored pack outside of green should be a guaranteed sticker that we NEED. 5). “Dice Grab” should be an option just like “Cash Grab” 6). Completing a board should be more than 50 dice after a certain point, the boards get harder so the dice should be increased.  7). Less money rewards and more dice rewards.  Thank you! 💕",User Feebback

3,2023-05-14 15:47:16,I love this game but I’m absolutely tired of having to click out of 3 ads every single time I enter and every time I run out of rolls. I would rather find out if I want to buy more because I want to. It’s so annoying,Too many ads

1,2023-04-23 23:37:27,"Not monopoly, not even a game. You just tap where it says and come back every few minutes/hours to collect currency then rinse repeat.

3,2023-11-05 20:23:19,Like the game but the amount of popups make me want to delete the game. If i wanted to buy something i know where to go and would do it on my own accord. The dice limit is kind if ridiculous too.,Limit the pop-ups!!!!
1,2023-11-05 16:31:33,It’s become very obvious to me and plenty others that monopoly go is rigged. You can clearly watch the game and it purposely gives you one more or one less than what you need to get anywhere. Just because I refuse to pay to play the game doesn’t mean I should get punished so to speak. Monopoly count your days cause a lawsuit is coming,Rigged
3,2023-11-03 23:58:35,I really want to give 5 stars however lately I have not been receiving my dive from Dot Dash nor from  Equity Extravaganza or Peg-e. I am really frustrated! I have reported this issue and nothing has been done. Can someone please please help?,Great game but-

1,2023-11-03 00:36:26,Never get any new stickers all duplicates. Never get any gold stickers this game is all about the money not the people that are trying to enjoy the game. I am done as soon as Epic is over tired of spending all my time trying to trade with others to get any completed set.   8 dice an hour is a sign they expect you to pay to play.,Horrible Rigged game
4,2023-11-02 13:57:53,"I love this game BUT, they need to add more spots on the board to accumulate dice faster. They want people to purchase rolls but that still doesn’t work unless you purchase a lot. I refuse to purchase. Update the Board.",Add to the Board

2,2023-10-29 05:22:13,Give us some dice to work with. Let us get some new stickers. I can’t even try to complete a set to get dice because I can NOT get a gold sticker that’s needed to finish it. People don’t mind spending a little $ here and there. But we’re not going to do it if the game is this unenjoyable,Becoming unbearable

1,2023-09-27 17:11:07,The game is okay but it’s selfish. You can get duplicate gold cards but you can’t trade them or you can buy money and dice but no cards this game would be so much better if you would be able to trade the gold cards.

1,2023-09-20 03:07:05,There’s barely any dice. Packs never give card you need! And free to play but pay to win. I don’t understand why they don’t give us any way of get dice.

1,2023-07-26 01:03:03,"Started off being a fun game but my complaints are pretty much the same as everyone else’s.. waiting a hour for 8 rolls, never getting the actual cards you need, & the cost it takes to build makes it feel like a chore. Unless you’re buying rolls it will not keep you entertained for long.",It has potential
2,2023-07-24 13:55:20,"You literally can play for 5 minutes and your rolls are gone. After a certain level, it’s hard to progress forward because you only get 8 rolls an hour which really isn’t enough to do anything. Imma give the game one more week and I’m done",Not enough rolls

1,2023-07-23 02:20:17,This star isn’t for the game per say. It is for the added friends I have that aren’t giving me credit.

Thank you.,No friends added for dice

1,2023-07-13 10:13:21,I would give this game a 5 star rating but even thought it’s part of the game there are players that constantly spam no matter how many times you unfriend them they add back and continue there should be a way after unfriending someone you can also block them from adding you back,Spamming players

5,2023-07-11 02:49:16,I like the game. The only con is that you have to wait 1 hr before you can earn rolls. By then  your entire board would be knocked down.,More rolls.
4,2023-07-11 03:29:00,I was actually surprised by how fun this game is. It’s not like basic monopoly which makes it 10x more fun. You get to build stuff and earn cash through playing. It’s definitely a good game.,Surprisingly awesome!

I will not spend another cent on this game!!! If things don’t change I will quit and remove the game!!! Stop being so greedy and maybe you’ll get more players instead your running the game into the ground👍👍👍,Greedy much!!!
5,2023-09-01 23:03:16,I just want to make a suggestion for this game. If you roll doubles then your next roll should not cost any dice.,Suggestion
5,2023-08-31 16:13:34,This game is addicting you won’t be able To put it down till you’re forced by having no rolls lol !!!!,Addicting!
1,2023-09-01 07:08:09,"all of the offers this game has been putting out are to expensive!  deals like $85, $90, even $100 offers. my significant other has the game too and has way better offers that are around $15 to $20. is this something that needs to be fixed? at least for me?",To Expensive!

3,2023-08-27 05:18:07,I really enjoy this game but it’s becoming very annoying that’s it’s so hard to get the stamps needed to complete boards and when you exchange your duplicate stamps you only in up with more duplicates this alone is making this game a cash cow,Fun game but…

1,2023-07-26 16:58:17,This game was fun at first but it seems like they just keep giving g the same stickers. You buy rolls and when it comes with stickler it’s duplicates. The reading group that’s linked to the app is full of scammers so you can’t even trade. It’s no longer fun. I’m thinking of deleting at this point 😏  Give more new stickers with purchases or winnings thanks,No longer fun

1,2023-05-29 14:20:51,The more money you spend on dice the further you get in the game and more rewards received.  I also don’t like the game has a revenge setting to earn rewards.

1,2023-10-06 22:56:57,"This game is fun and playable! It is very addictive with lots of progress and various fun activities including events. Don’t be fooled however, some events require partners that you can’t switch so if they bail you won’t complete the event without paying money. Other events it’s reasonable to be top five but players who pay money take the top spots.",Good game with paywalls
1,2023-10-05 00:27:47,people that you aren’t friends with constantly smacking your board and robbing you without any methods of revenge is terrible. the stickers distribution system is terrible. not being able to block people that you are not friends with is terrible. completed weekly objectives and did not receive shield.,Awful algorithm
4,2023-10-01 10:03:06,I love the game but I think they should give more dice for each level you pass. I’m spend way to much real Money cause the game is really addictive. I do love it though.,More dice to roll
4,2023-09-29 21:41:56,I really like monopoly. The only thing that I dislike is it seems that the only way you advance to get the top scores on the events is if you spend money on rolls.,Fun
4,2023-09-29 16:45:05,"I really enjoy this game for a time waster, but I’m slightly curious as to why the amounts taken for bank heists are different? Why is it taking more from me than what they got the heist for? By like 200,000?",Curiosity

5,2023-09-25 00:18:39,Monopoly Go had me hooked on the first day. Deserves more than 5 stars if I could rate it higher. Just keep on rollin 🎲,Just an overall great game
2,2023-09-27 17:12:20,Fun game but getting ANYTHING is difficult unless you pay money. Need dice? You get 80 in 10 hours. Need stickers? You can get the same 1-2 ⭐️ over and over but GOOD LUCK getting a gold star sticker to complete your album. Or any 4-5 ⭐️ in general. Wish this game wasn’t so rigged on everything.,Fun game but
1,2023-09-27 16:58:54,"This game has gone downhill with each new idea the devs introduce.  It’s pay-to-play with predetermined outcomes.   The album remains 15K, but each sheet has a reduced reward.  Getting information from Scopely is nearly impossible and if there is a glitch (many glitches), it takes weeks to be addressed and investigated. .",Major disappointment.
1,2023-09-26 20:59:09,This game used to be fun you could actually play it. Now you barely get any dice and hardly any new cards. The only way you will is if you spend money on this game. So if you are just wanting to play for fun definitely don’t do it because you won’t complete the albums and when you do there’s barely any rewards to it.,Trash
5,2023-09-23 01:04:18,Great game just gotta reward people with more dice’s instead of having to spend so much money for them,Rewards not to great

I keep getting the same cards, Including golds. My favorite it the team events although this past one I didn’t receive half of my cookies when I landed on them.",Stingy
4,2023-09-22 20:00:27,It’s an amazing game but I constantly have an issue when it comes to collecting my prizes from my tournaments winnings. It has happened at least 4 times!,Tournament prizes
1,2023-09-21 17:12:21,The game glitches. You never get the acutal cards you need. This update is worse than the original release. I have 8 of the same 1 star gold cards which means I can’t complete the pack even if I wanted to. The prizes have went to basically nothing. Don’t worry though you can always BUYY more. Trash deleting the game ✌🏾,Horrible
1,2023-09-21 14:36:16,"This is a fun game, and the sticker trading Facebook group is a fun added community experience. But the dice!! They do not give you nearly enough dice to be able to enjoy the game! It’s hard most days to be able to play for more than a minute or two at a time because you run out of dice right away with little gain!",Not enough dice!
1,2023-09-21 07:40:22,Of course they would turn monopoly into one of those games where you have limited turns that recharge over time and want to get your money. Really boring just holding a roll button and watching my icon move around over and over. No strategy or competition. I miss regular games and regular monopoly,Boring and typical
1,2023-09-20 19:46:47,Game gives you the same stickers over and over. Never get the new ones you need. This is the developers way to get you to pay to play. Even then takes you forever to win rolls and the right stickers. Game good to pass time but you’ll never win even if you pay to play.,Looking like a scam for money.
1,2023-09-20 05:37:57,The loss of stickers dice rewards stickers sent and never received rewards not received extras like higher multiplyer for 10 minutes not given and why is it so hard to get gold stickers then the 8 dice per hour be serious and 50 dice per level up like the prices to buy land don’t keep getting higher and higher,Dissatisfied
1,2023-09-19 22:14:10,This game has become nothing but greed the fact that they try to get you to purchase their stickers and money in the store and as you level up you still don’t get enough dices. The fact they took away capped dices and dice links shows how greedy they are. I hope this game burns because of their greed!,Greed
4,2023-09-19 20:59:42,I love this game but they Need to take off the medium heist I can't get anything more than that and it's getting annoying every single time so it's a really good game but they need to take it off.,Medium heist

1,2023-09-16 09:18:19,This game WAS fun till they decided to make the dice links unavailable so you HAVE to pay real money if you want dice. Same with putting gold cards in each pack this current season like as if the gold rims in a few packs weren’t a problem last season why would they add more?? Definitely a money hungry game.,Not worth playing

1,2023-09-13 16:43:45,This game requires no skill. It’s the equivalent as watching a slot machine spin over and over again. Once you run out of “dice” you’ll get endless pop up’s to spend money to get more spins. It’s just a slot machine. If your kids play this game be careful.   As for the game itself. No skill. Just watch your money grow. Nothing else.,This game has no skill and is predatory

3,2023-08-19 18:35:45,I believe the higher you get the more dice you get for completing a board and regeneration time needs to be reduced and since higher star stickers are rare maybe a daily wheel to spin to get more of a chance to collect them,MonopolyGO

1,2023-08-02 10:18:29,I have uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing works. I’m literally stuck on a certain part? Screen? Heck idk. I recently just tried playing this. But everytime I get on it says I can start leveling up my net worth by buying land markers. It won’t let me click off that screen or give me an x button or anything ☹️,Maybe it’s just mine?
5,2023-07-23 13:09:49,Keep rolling the dice and moving around the board.. add your friends.. build houses and get new city’s to build on new boards.,Entertaining for sure

3,2023-07-25 13:54:22,Just another money hungry game. Probably hundreds of advertisements to get you to buy more dice in order to play the game. A lot of the gameplay seems to be rigged to in order to get you to spend more money. Don’t waste your time imo.,Meh

1,2023-06-06 16:50:45,Once you open the game you’ll spend 3 minutes claiming bogus prizes and exiting special offers. You can’t really play the game It’s like they catered this game to be like a never ending slot machine with pop ups glitter and glam for numb soulless people  Oh and this game has NOTHING to do with actual monopoly  Id rather eat Big Macs and play McDonald’s Monopoly and til I Croke than play this game,Too many pop ups

2,2023-06-03 12:37:36,This game takes entirely to long to recharge dice rolls 6 per hour is ridiculous and makes almost impossible to get through gold rush in the allotted time. It also takes some of the fun out the game as well. Also stop with all the pop ups.,Could be better
1,2023-06-02 05:21:36,This game is a child’s game and should not be showing any kind of sexual content. I bring this up because in a new in game purchase they put a gay flag with a caption saying “love is love”. This is shown as soon as you run out of dice or log in.

5,2023-05-14 01:52:55,What I Rate about this Game is that It’s Very Addictive and Fun To play I give it about 10/10 Good job To who ever  made this Game keep Updating this game and i we’ll Keep playing,(Monopoly Best Game Ever On Apple)
1,2023-05-23 19:33:05,I love this game but my main issue is the hour wait for dice replenishment. I can cope with all the ads however the wait is a disappointment. You have more options for money rewards and stickers than dice. The stickers are very repetitive the new ones are hard to come by. This game can be something great.,It take too long to reload dice
1,2023-05-18 18:48:46,I love this game only thing I hate about it is the fact that there a bunch of popups at the beginning of the game trying to get u to buy stuff which i will never spend real money on the game at all. Also I hate the stickers that you win in the game they are pointless and dumb they need to have options to turn stickers off for good.,Great game

2,2023-11-07 00:52:17,This game is so hard to achieve goals or win the tournaments. They need to be separate based on your game level. So the people that have less can actually win. We can’t ever get 4-5 star cards to complete the album and win the prizes,Frustrating

3,2023-11-03 01:05:09,There needs to be more ways to earn rolls. The devs need to put that in whether it be through ads or something else. But the only way to really get more rolls is by paying actual money.,Rolls
3,2023-11-02 22:17:08,Exactly what the ads say except you don’t get 100 dice on chance cards…maybe like 3 depending on your multiplier. Four star would be five if there were a little more time on partner events,As the ads

1,2023-11-01 17:25:30,The car event is almost over and the game is crashing I can’t even build. It’s happening to a lot of people as well so it’s not a local issue.

1,2023-11-01 16:40:13,After this last update there seems to be a bug in the game. It prevents you from building and once you start the game restart and whatever you had built is no longer built. It will also restart itself while you’re in the middle of playing it.,FIX THE BUG!!

You only get 7 dice every hour which if you use the multiplyer they go way too fast. Awesome game just need to rethink how many dice are given out.,Not enough dice given
1,2023-07-10 13:16:21,I’m sure this game would really be fun if you could get your actual wins from tournaments and play without all the extra bugs. Biggest waste of my time. Don’t download this crap. Support doesn’t even have a decent response time. 5 days is ridiculous. Their contests don’t even last that long.,Need better developers
1,2023-07-08 22:52:51,Why do we have to wait an hour for only five dice? I understand it gets better but that’s only by a single one every once in a while.   Also stop with the constant pop ups whenever I run out of dice. I’m not paying for anything and never will.,Waiting an hour for only a few dice is ridiculous.

1,2023-05-29 04:23:21,Monopoly is a scamming game.  They make it hard for you to complete sticker albums gives you dupes. They know when you’re out of dice so say if I get to spin the wheel they’ll purposely give me dice. They also be cheating when we roll dice sometimes it lands on a property before the property it supposes to land on or sometimes elsewhere. It’s like a repeated cycle every time you roll.,Scam

1,2023-04-21 03:18:35,Can’t play for more than about 5-10 minutes max once you get past the first few cities which doesn’t take long at all then it’s constant waiting to roll while the dice accumulate at an extremely slow rate while the game shoves ads to buy dice down your throat. Deleted after 2 days.,Typical money grab

3,2023-11-03 14:29:18,Its Too Predictable how you guys simulate plays so that you get close to winning large prizes and try to force you to buy dice by wasting all your dice right before you win the prizes,Waste dices on plays to force us to buy dice
2,2023-11-02 23:26:10,the dice rolls don’t what the winning targets are like utilities and the trains. The game is being stingy with 4&5 ⭐ stickers. The only way to complete the sticker sets is is buy gold stickers. Even the guaranteed missing will give you a regular card instead of a gold 😡,Can’t win without paying
2,2023-11-02 15:39:13,For weeks all I’m getting is same stickers plus to get more rolls when low really takes the fun away.  If it wasn’t for these 2 things I would give better stars.  Probably much different if you paid for game.,Stickers
3,2023-11-02 12:48:52,Literally every pack I get is the same old stickers I already have. It’s a pain in the rear to get a new one. Love playing the game but the stickers not being new is getting to be a issue,Send out new stickers

1,2023-11-01 17:21:04,Iv been trying to play all morning and its crashed every time i try and upgrade to another map.

3,2023-11-01 16:17:18,I just updated the game and now it crashes every like 4 or 5 minutes. And I agree with the stickers. It’s the same old ones over and over.,Crashing
2,2023-11-01 14:17:25,"To get a new card you have to waste your spins daily for months it feels like. Then on special events like the car one, you spend 100 steering wheels just to gain 300 points and barely land higher tiles. It’s irritating and has been a waste of time.",Not worth it
1,2023-10-31 18:05:51,"This game is fun yes but you will not complete anything without either help from a vast amount of friends and or dropping a lot of money into the game and even then it’s both worth it   You won’t complete sets , you won’t win tournaments because of bots they put in the game “ to make u spend more money “ this game is a total CASH GRAB DONT DOWNLOAD IT OR WASTE YOUR TIME",PAY TO WIN
2,2023-10-30 22:25:55,"This game starts out being fun, then you need *very* difficult stickers to complete albums and get any dice.  I will not pay a dime of real money to add dice.  Just make it a paid game for $20 or something and let people have more than 8 dice per hour.",Just make it a paid game…
3,2023-10-27 18:56:21,I really like the game. And I enjoy playing it. But it’s cost money to get anything done.  It’s fun.  But I just refuse to spend money on games that I’m going to lose interest over in the next month.,To do good you have to pay.
3,2023-10-27 14:53:37,WAY too many ads  you get the same stickers hard to have a chance to complete the sets and no one wants to gift them when they have extra,It’s fun but
1,2023-10-24 21:55:44,You literally have to pay $20 to get a chance at one sticker you don’t have already. Constantly repeated stickers with no possibility of a new one and not enough rolls or time to finish events. The same people end up at the top of the events every single time right from the get go.

3,2023-10-19 23:13:48,The concept is good but recently getting any new stickers is HARD and forget about getting gold stickers. I’ve stopped playing as much bc it’s so repetitive. Even trading in your multiples doesn’t get you any good rewards.,Eh
2,2023-10-16 09:16:21,It’s almost like gambling. They want you to pay for almost everything. It’s a fun game but they make it impossible to win or get cards especially the higher up you get on levels. Then they only give you 8 dice every hour it’s crazy.,Rigged game

Where’s my 6 referral dice credits. Also landed on cookies and didn’t get cookies. I finished all 4 cakes but the grand prize only being 5k dice is a sham. Get it together,Glitching
2,2023-09-10 06:45:02,We definitely could use more dice !! and more chances and ways to get gold cards. It makes no sense to have all these sets and missing just hold cards and I haven’t received any.. the real money is not even worth the dice and money y’all tryina give out !,It’s crazy
5,2023-09-09 13:03:06,I really enjoy this game with my family and we all have a blast when earned lots of money,Love all the way!!
1,2023-09-09 16:21:24,"The game was soooo fun at first now it’s constantly “glitching” I don’t get all my money. The competition I’m not getting the cookies I land on half the time. The game is not fun anymore, it’s just more frustrating than anything. And by the recent reviews it’s not just me! Let’s not talk about customer service! Been waiting days for a response and NOTHING!",Rip off
5,2023-08-30 22:43:03,"Love the game ! Super fun. One thing I would like to see, if we could write other players.",Message other players
1,2023-09-08 18:42:53,"It was fun in the beginning. This second album is awful. They placed gold stickers in every set. You keep getting the same duplicate cards, they give you the bare minimum of dice so that you’re forced to buy dice. They don’t give you the cookies when you land on them. By far the worst since I’ve been playing",Greed set in
4,2023-09-08 03:19:42,Love the game but there’s multiple glitches there’s been a few times where I land on the chocolate coins and it dosent give them to me but other than that it’s great!,Glitch
4,2023-09-06 13:58:50,"As much as I love this game, it’s becoming a pay to play game. They’ve lowered all the stickers and events rewards and now you can’t get dice unless you buy them :(",4 star
3,2023-09-05 13:59:05,Love the game but they need to fix the bugs! I was one token away from my next reward and now I'm missing them all. I worked hard to get those tokens. I just want them back.,Issues
5,2023-08-30 07:46:05,When I had downloaded the game it told me what to do and it helped me. I do recommend downloading this game😚 I’m gonna have so much fun and play this everyday lol 🙂download this game guys:) ;),THIS GAME IS SO FUN🤩🤩
5,2023-08-27 20:15:47,It’s a great game to play! I got addicted fast 😂. The only sad thing is is that I’m basically going to lose the 15k dice win due to having mutiple duplicate stickers 😭😭🫠,Amazing Game
1,2023-08-30 00:44:34,"I have been playing monopoly go since the first day, I love the game play sure, but the one thing I hate is the stickers. You guys barely give us stickers that we need. A lot of them need to be bought with actual money, and then you make it impossible to complete sets let alone the albums.",Kind of irritating.
2,2023-08-29 19:35:32,This game is often very glitchy and support never responds to issues. The customer support chat option seems like it would be a good option but I’ve used it a handful of times and my issues never seem to be addressed.,Poor Support

3,2023-08-27 01:52:59,"I love the game, but I wish we could send and receive dice from one another and we don't get enough dice  per hour. Super hard to get stickers that you need. Hopefully we can help make the game even better.",Love it
5,2023-08-26 23:51:01,Does this version fix the purchase errors?,Purchase errors
5,2023-08-24 03:05:16,A request cards from friends button would be cool. Or request and willing to trade would be cool.  Overall the game is fun and addictive.,awesome stuff
4,2023-08-26 19:52:14,Hey can you guys PLEASE make the GOLD CARDS tradable before the event ends…I feel like that will help ALOT of people finish the album…we’ve spent lots of money the least you can do is help us win 😩,Gold Cards
3,2023-08-26 05:23:25,"It’s a fun game very addictive, but the dice is very hard to get! You only get a certain amount of dice a day and once you run out which you’ll run out in less then 3 mins and have no dice the rest of the day it’s very annoying.",Dice
3,2023-08-25 18:34:55,I love this game and I’ve been trying to purchase packs and I have multiple cards linked with funds and i constantly get “purchase error” I don’t know what to do anymore!,Continuous purchase error
1,2023-08-25 15:12:12,I bought something and did not receive it and then tried contacting them but the customer support dose not exist u just click on the customer support button and it brigs to another site then u klick the link then u go to another site and from there u clime on the game and then it brings u back to the first screen u started on,Scam
3,2023-08-24 17:43:02,"COMPLETELY RIGGED!!! No reason to be landing in jail or tax so frequently on every spin!! Quite ridiculous in my opinion, I’m not satisfied! Not to mention, when you have incentives building up in a tile; the game makes it impossible to land on that tile! Ridiculous",Monopoly GO!

5,2023-08-21 22:13:35,It’s very very fun I don’t have any complaints but it’s a really fun game to play when your bored and I think you can play offline!!😝😝 perfect game,Fun fun fun
5,2023-08-20 18:44:52,But they never want to give you cards yo need for an album even if you buy stuff. Only down fall.,Love this game!
5,2023-08-20 16:34:49,I love the game. Just wish when you run out of dice they give you more than 6 dice for every hour.,😃
5,2023-08-19 20:07:12,This is really really hard and good for long rides and has a bunch of levels for me as a kid and I love it I love it so so much and it’s really really good  and bye I love the states and county’s on here ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,The game
3,2023-08-20 16:14:34,It is absolutely ridiculous how long it takes to generate dice….. also not to mention warning stickers should be a bit more simpler since it’s such a huge part of the game other than that it’s a fun game,Meh
5,2023-08-19 14:43:15,The game is well put together. Easy to get into and hard to stop playing.  Well done!,Fun and addicting
5,2023-08-19 00:11:07,This game is so fun!!! I’ll be honest I play it so much during work I can’t get enough. I’m literally on the edge of my seat waiting for more dice roles!!!!,So fun and addicting.
2,2023-08-19 12:17:43,"The game is cool. Should probably integrate the sticker trading function into the actual game instead of doing it through Facebook and use the Facebook page for networking. Between the fake accounts, scammers, and adults acting shady over a game on the phone, the trading needs a MAJOR overhaul.",Trading Stickers is Bogus
5,2023-08-17 15:57:55,It’s very addicting when you get to it but be careful because there’s a lot of people that is going to wreck your houses and buildings,A cool game to play
5,2023-08-15 02:33:31,Great great game! Super fun and I like it a lot. Me and my family all hate each other now because we are very competitive but I still love the game 😁,Great!but uhh- 😅
4,2023-08-17 02:14:49,So this game is awesome but the game took $4.99 from my account and I did NOT I repeat I DID NOT get what I paid for at all I rather get a refund or get what was owed to me which was the dices and money for the game .,Refund my Money
1,2023-08-15 14:14:04,They only give you small amount of dice like it’s supposed to help and they want you to pay for the high for the same amount it’s not worth it I feel like they are cheating us in our rolls and money and the game modes might as well give up on them the tasks are high like we have a lot of dice and stickers lmfaooo 👎🏾,Dice game problem
5,2023-08-13 07:03:14,I love how addicting this game is. It’s so fun to play with online friends! A recommended download! You won’t be disappointed 🫶,Interacting and Competitive

5,2023-08-09 23:57:28,Great game but the $ they give us isn’t worth upgrading one house can we make the money we get more money lol,Loose dice to fast

3,2023-08-09 08:49:57,I don’t like the fact I can rack up on 40+ shields an soon as someone attempts to attack my building it removes one of my shields. I find that very unfair an a waste if y’all just going to act as if I don’t have a lot of protection 😡😡😡😡,What I don’t like
5,2023-08-06 15:37:29,This game is mad obsessing for me like for example a soon as I play it I can’t stop but yeah give it a try it’s a really good game!,I can’t stop playing
4,2023-08-07 07:53:46,Why does the came constantly gift duplicate GOLD CARDS when there isn’t anything we can do with them?  I’ve gotten over 2k cards and you only need 189,Fun but not fair

3,2023-08-04 12:50:47,I love this game its really fun. But its not that mich like monopoly. You dont take turns eith another player you just get a bunch of rolls on your own board. Could you add an “online mode” so we can play against other players like real monopoly?,"I like it, but…."
2,2023-08-03 21:53:55,All you do is click roll over and over again. Takes no strategy and wastes time is about it. Not buying the current rating - seems fishy. This game is great if you’re 5 years old or an unemployed moron only,Pointless and 0 Strategy Required
4,2023-08-02 06:53:39,It would be great but they keep giving the same star stickers and only 50 dice roll no matter the level,It would be great
5,2023-07-30 11:12:10,This version of the famous Monopoly board game is absolutely amazing and so much fun to play with friends and family.,Better Than The Board Game
1,2023-08-01 15:47:32,"Games alright but good luck trying to start playing, any time you turn on the game or run out of spins it gives you an average of 8 pop ups back to back.

3,2023-05-10 02:28:26,They push you to buy more rolls almost stop playing because of them but I still play because I like the board game that is my only problem with is game,They push you to buy stupid
1,2023-05-07 09:54:58,This is not Monopoly. This is logging in to watch yourself go around the board mindlessly until you run out of dice rolls waiting until you collect enough money to move up to the next level. There is no competative part to the game other than ‘stealing’ other players money on a railroad spot. Don’t waste your time with this.,This game is not good

3,2023-11-06 01:46:57,Yes it’s a good game but the only issue I have of this game is starting again I’ll be almost done with a board then have to start over and I also dislike how it’s hard to get new cards and rare it is,Good game
1,2023-11-04 20:33:16,Started out loving the game. However it’s hard to get anywhere if you’re not dropping constant money.

Hopefully they fix it some day.,Sad.

But honestly I’ve found more luck when not doing IAP’S  I’m sure that’s why most people delete the app after a month or two.,Great game however
4,2023-08-06 04:06:05,I love this game but I will get up close to 900ish dice and then all of a sudden the dice are gone and I only have about 20-30 left. Has happened several times,Love this game but…
5,2023-08-05 16:50:38,Its such an addicting game and its my favorite board game but most people dont like it because of how long it takes but i love it!❤️,I love it!
5,2023-08-05 14:28:07,"OMG, a great way to spend time with your friends and play and have a friendly competition so much fun I recommend it",Looooooooooove it
5,2023-07-30 02:11:17,I’m a player in monopoly name kinglos and I trade a cards with friends and didn’t get my cards .. I send my friend a card and Friday didn’t get it help..,Trade albums
2,2023-08-03 23:23:24,Amazing game but you definitely have a hard time building dice back up after a decent run.  And everyone is looking for the same 6 stickers to end the contest and they’re just made impossible to get and it’s becoming a lot less fun,Lack of dice and Stickers
2,2023-07-31 16:22:12,I would have given this app a perfect 5 if it makes gold cards available for trading. It’s impossible to get gold cards even after finishing the tasks and mini tournaments (i.e. monopoly fair). Buying dice and pink packets are not helpful too: I just kept on getting duplicates.,Gold cards trade
1,2023-07-31 13:29:52,When I downloaded it I wanted to play with friends it was going great til I leveled up to 4th level and now the screen for two weeks now daily has been the same I was starting to like the game.  I want to play it but what the use of having it take up storage if I can’t play it!,Downloaded to play with friends.
5,2023-07-28 18:03:17,I love Monopoly Period but it his version is so addictive and cute too . I’m happy even when I’m getting robbed by friends .. lol,Omg  this version of Monopoly is Uber Cute… I’m so Addicted Already!
5,2023-07-26 13:01:41,"So much fun to do on here! I never want to get off this bundle of fun and money! I’ll list a few things.      You can play monopoly everywhere,  You can shut down your opponents landmarks,  Do a bank heists or a mega heist if you’re lucky,   Be a tycoon, and so much more!   I promise you won’t regret getting this game! ( your friends are going to be so mad at a heist and shut down)  PLAY MONOPOLYGO NOW!",MonopolyGO is the best

2,2023-07-25 16:38:16,It’s a great game I love it everything about it and would come back and rate 5 stars I just hate that u can’t change ur profile picture to something in ur camera roll or options they give u,Um let us change our profile pictures

3,2023-07-18 12:51:59,When I first downloaded the game it was fun and exciting. I played it all day. I just got super bored with it. I got to board level 56 and it began to require more money to play. I guess that’s the point. I’m done. Moving on.,"Started great, got boring fast"
5,2023-07-12 08:53:43,It’s a fun game and definitely a twist from the regular monopoly games best mobile monopoly game ever it’s also super relaxing thanks for making this game!!,"Fun, different and relaxing"
4,2023-07-16 22:21:01,I love playing this game! The only suggestion is that we should be able to buy specific cards or just the packs by themselves.,So much fun!

3,2023-07-07 00:13:36,I was about to win 1500 dice rolls in the event and then it restarted my progress. It also restarted my progress for the daily tasks. Need this fixed or I’m just gonna uninstall. To lose 1500 dice roll is insane. The game charges $100 for that,Bugs

1,2023-07-05 13:58:42,I actually caught myself getting really into this game. Until Monopoly doesn’t grant you all your rewards or the game crashes and erase everything you work for. I had 68 mill and over 1.5k dice rolls just GONE. I restarted everything and it now wants me to create an account (already have one). Over level 500. Such a waste,Decent Game To Pass Time
5,2023-06-26 22:27:59,I just downloaded this game last night and I’m already obsessed with this game everything is so prefect I LUV IT💕💕 I have 0 problems with this game,Best game EVER
3,2023-07-01 20:32:12,I wish this game was more like the original. I wish I could play regular monopoly with my friends. The original costs $5 I’m not paying that. Really disappointed that it is not more like the original.,Not amazing

5,2023-06-03 02:20:12,Need more dices to be able to play longer,Need to be giving out more dices
3,2023-06-04 17:50:08,When you reach a certain point you get 6 dice per hour which isn’t even 3 minutes of gameplay. Its rather frustrating,Fun game but they try to bully you into buying stuff
5,2023-05-23 17:32:37,I can't win with all these duplicate stickers!!! Please improve the sticker odds. How imma get my token and trophy if y'all gone keep giving me the same stickers?!!!,Stickersssss
5,2023-05-22 20:42:04,It greets you with coins and rolls and it is good for on the go when your bored and is stress reliving and free so if your reading this review I recommend you to play it trust me its fun and addicting HAVE A GOOD GREAT DAY TODAY 😀☺️🤗😁,"Addictive,fun,free"
5,2023-05-18 19:24:59,Only bad thing is they really love to shove the ads in your face every time you run out of anything. Bit much.,Pretty fun!
5,2023-05-02 13:37:31,I’ve been playing for a few hours and I love the celebrations and graphics. It makes monopoly more lively.,So far so good
5,2023-04-28 13:41:20,Great game only thing is I feel like you should be able to spend some of the game cash to buy more dice rolls,Monopoly Go
5,2023-04-25 01:39:20,Game is fun I don’t usually play games but I’m hooked I play when I can and never spent a dime yet I have millions and about 900 dice play it and use the multipliers,Fun game
4,2023-04-18 15:19:33,It’s a generic game that will get boring overtime by just giving it a few mins to play. A good time killer if you’re waiting on something for like 5 to 10 mins. Overall a great fun and easy game!,Great game!
2,2023-04-16 14:41:54,This game is fun but the frequency and number of ads is absolutely insane. Starting the game? Click through 5 ads. Out of rolls? Click through 4 ads. Switch from build board back to play board? Click through 3 ads. I get the freemium model but come on.,Fun but…
5,2023-11-07 01:41:01,"This game is simple yet so entertaining, I get stuck on playing it for a hour at a time",Very enjoyable
4,2023-11-11 14:22:59,Once you get so many stickers you just get the same ones you will never complete the sticker journey thing!,Stickers are a scam
2,2023-11-09 16:28:59,The game is cool but not getting my rewards is crazy. I’ve been waiting on my first place win since October 12 th and still haven’t recieved  Update: I have contacted customer service since October 12! And still have not received a response yet. It’s going on 2 months!,It’s ok
1,2023-11-09 15:00:03,Played for about a month and monetization in this game is always in your face. They are always asking for money. Random screens always pop up in your face asking for money. Sick and tired of hitting the red X to close all the pop ups. Would be a okay game if the developers didn’t simp for cash all the time.,Uninstalled
5,2023-11-03 00:27:03,I love the app it is interesting and amazing and wonderful I could play on it for hours and hours but I have school,Fun
1,2023-11-04 21:41:16,"Let me start by saying I actually enjoy this game but Jesus the amount of pay to play popups is ludicrous. In a single session, I had 11 popups asking me to buy dice, or stickers, or pay to get back to the free packs. I know where to buy things if I want to, I don’t need it shoved into my face constantly. Beware their predatory cash grab tactics",Predatory cash grab
1,2023-11-04 18:33:39,I just finished 10th in the last tournament and I didn’t receive my shield. I played all morning just to get in 20th place just to not get the gift. I have seen a lot of glitches in this game. Not getting the mega heist when you win it. But it’s pretty bad when you don’t the things like shields. I draw the line there.,Shield
5,2023-11-02 13:49:27,Now i’ll give a 5 star again! Now i can play normally thank you!!,Thanks for fixing it!

2,2023-11-02 01:58:57,The game is so fixed it’s not funny. I just had 4 back-to-back spins and each time gave me the 35 dice. Today my game crashed multiple times and each time I’d have to redo spins and it would give me the exact same cards every single time.,Broken game
3,2023-11-01 21:50:19,I like the game and all but today they have away 500 wheels for the partner event and I was left out like they and my partner costed me 5k spins and cards and honeslty I would like to be givin what I should have my spins and cards,Bug or do they dislike me?

Have you seen the prices to even get dice? Ridiculous!!! This game used to be so much fun, and now it’s had all the fun sucked out of it. That’s why I only give one star.",Unfair

3,2023-09-11 20:19:16,"Overall I love to play this game, yet being pay to win with dice rolls is pretty annoying, need more ways to get free dice, only way to get thousands of rolls is to purchase them in my opinion.","Game is good, but pay to win"

1,2023-09-08 01:44:43,"This game is all about the dice and the game’s dice generator,,I’m done spending money on dice and have the game’s dice generator eat them, the players shouldn’t have to spend hundreds of dollars for dice only to waste your money and have the game run your dice out, without giving enough dice back to navigate through the game and events, shame on you , YOU RUINED MY FAV GAME",PLAYERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY

2,2023-09-03 12:28:53,This is a straight pay-for-play game. Why not have th option of seeing ads instead of paying? I’m not a payer and the game get a little boring after a while. Give me your contacts - no! Nice try but classic Monopoly is so much better.,Pay for Play Game That Gets Boring
4,2023-09-02 20:25:22,So I am absolutely addicted to this game but I am super disappointed in the new season. Gold star stickers in every set and even less dice for each set completed. 😕,Good game but New Season is meh.
5,2023-08-28 23:12:52,I grew up on monopoly and it’s a fun twist that Yu don’t have to wait on no one to take their turn and multiple people play I like hope Yu do too,Fun☀️
3,2023-08-31 17:29:19,My game froze and even though I restarted my phone and deleted and downloaded the app again the game would stay in the same image 😭 so sad I was getting into the game,Game frozed and can’t play again
2,2023-08-30 21:09:59,Game is fun don’t get me wrong but as far as getting these stickers I mean my gosh literally giving out the same stickers I’ve been at 181 of 189 for at least a month and have yet to see a new sticker y’all could do much better seriously,Better sticker

3,2023-08-28 02:18:49,I love playing this game every second i get the chance but i’m having trouble getting my game to load up. it’s been doing pretty good but it’s been completely frozen once i’ve opened the app.,Lagging
4,2023-08-28 00:45:32,I really enjoy this game but I wish that you can choose the amount of rolls you can use. And a higher chance to get new stickers.,No game is perfect

1,2023-08-27 02:20:56,"Idk if it’s the game to make you have to buy sets to get the cards you need but somehow the trading system is awful. No one trust anyone and some are trading cards for money or 20 stars. It’s a really good game really addicting and fun, love playing with my husband and my siblings but it’s frustrating. Really don’t recommend it unless you like stress 🤷🏻‍♀️",Scamming and fun
5,2023-08-25 06:01:15,Fun game just don’t purchase anything because it doesn’t really give you what you pay for lol,Fun game!
2,2023-08-26 23:53:01,"Wish you could trade monopoly cash for dice rolls. Love the game but the price yo buy more dice are expensive once you run out.  Even the freebies of 10 or 20 dice is nice, but for some, that’s just one turn to throw. Multiplying a throw by 5 or 10 will drain a purchased 1400 dice pack in minutes.",Expensive to play.
1,2023-08-26 14:04:24,I purchased an offer 3 package yesterday said payment successful and has been taken out my bank account but I did not receive anything on the game I contacted customer service and I’ve heard nothing for the last 24 hours scared to spend anymore money on here now,Stilll haven’t received what I purchased

2,2023-08-23 01:22:46,This app is fun but it’s not a game. It’s a slot machine that uses a board game board. The only time it’s fun is if you have lots of rolls and those realistically cost money. You need a consistent 10-15 dollars a week or more to keep playing. If you have plenty of disposable income then this game is fit you.,Not a game
4,2023-08-20 16:11:30,Let us watch a 30 second ad for 5 rolls 🙄 we’re all tired of waiting an hour to roll 5 times 🤦🏻‍♀️,Let us watch ads for more rolls
1,2023-08-20 13:33:52,They will not give you any new sticks no matter how long you been playing. Dice is slow they want you to spend money on dice that’s how they make they money. But I’m about to delete the app it will have you wasting money and getting nothing back in return and give people STICKERS!!!!! So they can WIN dice,Wants you to spend money
3,2023-08-20 06:10:07,They need to let us trade Gold sticker it’s frustrating not doing so. Not everyone can spend money to keep rolling and the odds to getting gold stickers are low and what’s even worse is getting a duplicate.,Sticker trade
5,2023-08-17 18:27:25,"Fun game, wish there was a way to get more dice though because I can’t stop playing!",Addicting
3,2023-08-18 23:42:53,Hyped you up to think your going to win something big. And then make it impossible to get it. You can get a 10 gifts and it will tell you that you only have 3. But it’s fun to play,This game cheats

3,2023-08-05 13:28:29,I love the game but all of a sudden it’s starting to pause in the middle of why I’m playing. Tell me that I need to reset the game and then I lose my points dice in money that I just earned before the message pop up.,I like it but
2,2023-08-05 12:44:51,First love the game. But today it’s going crazy. I’m losing roles and my prizes. It keeps rebooting. I lost 150 swimming rings when I landed on income tax because it rebooted. I also lost 200 helmets because it rebooted.   Your contact is is only AI. It just says sorry in the end and tries to make me start over.,Game issues.
3,2023-08-03 23:29:13,This game stresses me out with these stickers than has the nerve to have a trading group BUT NOBODY CAN FIND THE EXCAT SAME CARD I’ve spent soo much money on this game to have never found the stickers I need!!!

5,2023-07-28 01:13:33,This game is so fun ! Didn’t have fb but a lot of contacts actually play and was Abel to play with many of them!,Awesomeness
2,2023-07-30 13:54:43,"It’s a fun game AT FIRST. Then after a while it’s annoying. You never get the cards you need to complete sets, you go to jail in the game more than you do in real life.

Both my wife and I play and we were having a lot of fun, but the past 1-1.5 weeks have just been boring since we can’t make any more progress.  :/  I believe they’ve lowered your chances of winning the side games and getting more dice.",NERFED

2,2023-07-14 01:04:52,"I absolutely love this game but the only reason it has a single problem because when you have rolls you run out and have to wait almost angel hour, if it was to 10 minutes then this game would be PERFECT!!!!!!",Such a great game but one small problem
1,2023-07-12 03:21:04,"At the begging the game was fun but here lately it seems like the same people can attack you endlessly. This would be fine if it was a part of the “friends” list so that you could remove the attacker, but they are randoms. There is no reason someone should be able to attack you 15 times in a row.",Terrible balancing
5,2023-07-10 22:14:59,It’s fun to play I recommend they make the gold cards tradable for at least a limited time though,I love this game!!!
3,2023-07-11 00:01:07,"You should make it possible to change your in game avatar, not only that but it also doesn’t update as fast as it probably should.",Good game but a few suggestions
4,2023-07-09 19:26:44,I still need other cards that are traceable but I get mostly gold that aren’t tradable and have nothing special about them.,Too many golds
1,2023-07-10 10:38:13,After an hour wait they give u 5 rolls which is gone in about 30 secs. This game is trying to force you to buy this and buy that. Everytime you click something it’s pop ups to buy and buy and buy. You can’t enjoy monopoly or the experience.,Constant pop up forcing you to buy

2,2023-07-05 17:11:12,The game is good but the sever issues make this game lose a lot of stars. Server shuts down mid game when this happens money is lost heist are messed up and money can be taken while you are trying to build up properties. I lost chances to complete mini games,Glitchy

3,2023-06-20 17:54:31,Game is fun but why is my freebie always showing “0” on the count down and taking days to change over? You can’t trade gold cards. Not even a once a day special trade and limiting trades to 5 a day is bad too.,Fun but glitchy
3,2023-06-20 17:21:13,Game is great but when there is an issue with not receiving gifts or prizes dealing with customer service is horrible and you never get what’s promised but that’s pretty normal for scopley they do it with their other games as well,Great game bad customer service

4,2023-06-14 13:30:53,"I thought it would be more turn based, like regular monopoly. Instead, most of the game is automated. It is fun to attack/defend against other opponents, but that is the only real draw to the game.",It’s Alright.

1,2023-06-09 00:56:12,More time is spent closing pop ups for micro transactions than playing the game. There is NO strategy to this game just push the roll button and close the multiple pop ups trying to get you to spend real money. Game could be semi fun if there was no pop ups.,This is not monopoly it’s a pop up for micro transactions

2,2023-04-27 11:41:55,it’s a fun game and I’m enjoying it but having to wait an hour just for 5/6 dice is a little overboard in my opinion. I get waiting an hour for all of them to fill up but 5/6 every hour? I don’t want to wait hoursss in order to play :/,not bad but could be better

3,2023-10-18 21:24:51,The Monopoly Go greed has really made this game unplayable. Can’t complete sticker packs because I get the same gold stickers every time. The prices went up to buy dice. It was a good game. Now it’s a clear money grab.,Used to love it
3,2023-10-18 14:51:40,Game is fun. Make it to where you can send dice to friends. That would be great. Make it easier to get dice so we dont have to wait forever to play again. Stop sending the same stickers.,Monopoly.

1,2023-10-04 12:37:15,Game keeps having issues and you lose more than what they give back due to said issues. I’ve invested a lot of time into this game.

3,2023-09-07 07:16:54,I am addicted to this game! Like any other game there are things about it that as a player  I think could be different….  There should not be a cap on how many friends you can have. If we are to ONLY trade for stickers since they aren’t coming as often as we like (the GOLD FRAME) ones…we need a lot of friends to help complete sets so we can continue to play.  Please 🙏🏾 uncap friends count!!!!!  Other then that this game is super fun!!!  Thank you!  ChefCharla,Friends Capped…??
1,2023-09-07 01:52:18,The ads for Monopoly Go are too long in other games. Just be 5 or 10 seconds. Good god. I watch the ad for 30 seconds then another mini game thing pops up. Wait for that to end then an additional 5 seconds. That’s super annoying. As for the game itself it gets super repetitive/ boring,Annoying Ads
1,2023-09-01 12:32:25,"Why are we capped at 80 dice but every round penalties increase?  We should be able to remove unruly “friends” especially since we continuously interact with people we don’t know in the game.  Why can’t we trade gold cards if they are already unattainable? Waited 7 days for 1 gold card to complete an album, instead I received multiple duplicates for gold cards I already have… THAT I CAN’T TRADE!!!   We spend a lot of money in this game, but victory is still hard to reach.  Why would I keep spending money if I know I’m not going win/complete a task?",Things should be better
1,2023-08-31 21:11:49,"The fact that you can spend money on this game & still not accomplish anything is by far ridiculous. It doesn’t matter how far you level up, you will still continue to only get 50 rolls, which isn’t anything when the properties cost billions of dollars😒😒",Waste of time!!

2,2023-08-29 14:52:02,I love the game however I think the cost of some of these deals are quite ridiculous! The game is addictive and unfortunately I’ve found myself spending more money than I’d like to. I think that no deal should be more than $9.99!!!!!,Fun but expensive

3,2023-08-27 03:18:48,I need 3 Gold cards and have spent money trying to get them w/ NOTHING. I’ve tried contacting customer service but it just keep reverting me back to the same screen. Not sure what going on. Ugh 😡,Frustrating

1,2023-08-22 23:31:11,The game is more than aware of that fact that people scam others out of their cards and yet they do NOTHING. The scammers get to keep the cards and the person that gets cheated gets nothing. Instead of having a way to verify cards before they are sent they just choose to do nothing.,Card Trading
5,2023-08-22 10:14:38,Great game overall. I really feel like you guys should think about allowing people to gift rolls/dice.,Feedback

1,2023-08-11 12:35:14,we spend all this money to get these cards just to get the same ones over and over … this game is rigged! We should get a refund.

4,2023-07-07 19:31:05,My only complaint ya are contacting support is hard it puts you on with a bot that ends the conversation without getting a resolution   There is no way to easily report a sticker trade scammer going through support is very confusing  And dice regeneration is very slow I feel it should be 30 minutes at least instead of an hour   Other than those things the game is great and I love it,I love the game but…

1,2023-06-10 02:12:01,Played for about 20 minutes and didn’t enjoy it at all. There’s no actual game or thought to it. You just click the button to roll the dice. That’s it. There are no decisions to make to determine whether you will do better or worse at the game. Just click and roll that’s it.,Boring

1,2023-05-05 01:28:24,Games great in the begging then gets boring after you play for sometime. There are way too many pop ups and. You start the game and run out of rolls.

1,2023-05-01 15:25:53,One hour for 5 dice? I guess the devs want you to play 10 minutes per day unless you are willing to pay. I hate it when a game restrict play just so they can make a buck.

1,2023-09-28 16:13:01,It seems that the game is not allowing it to boot up. It constantly keeps saying error and goes back to booting up and then again does the same thing repeatedly. So far it’s rebooted over 30 times and still can’t play the game. Please fix the issue.,Constantly rebooting issue
2,2023-09-28 15:15:50,"This is a fun game for sure, but there are many little annoying problems. Game crashes often. Haven’t gotten a new sticker in a month. Right now the game will not even load or open even though im on wifi",50/50

1,2023-09-19 21:42:45,This is a fun game but they are making it impossible to have fun without spending money  to buy dice. There is a balance of making the game worth the play if you spend no money and still have the option open for people to buy dice. The game would still make money.,Stingy with the dice.
1,2023-09-19 10:45:41,"This game use to be fun. Now it’s impossible to play the game without having to spend money. If you can play only for 5 minutes a day, then wait 1 hour for 8 roles.

4,2023-09-16 03:16:48,Monopoly Go is a great game but I can’t give it 5 stars because of all the popups when you start the game. It’s so excessive and annoying to finally get to roll some dice.,Fun game
2,2023-09-17 02:53:53,The higher up you are on the boards you should get more dice !! They keep just giving you 50 .. they don’t let you collect all your stickers unless you spend money .. they constantly give you the same stickers !!,Game is ok

1,2023-08-31 22:33:42,You can’t play if you don’t have dice. The dice you win is very minimal and it gets frustrating not having any dice day after day. Plus all you get are duplicate stickers!! I’m assuming they’re wanting us to pay for it. Going to delete if things don’t change! Do better Monopoly Go creators!!! 🤬,They are greedy with dice
1,2023-08-31 19:45:47,Y’all have lost your minds. 185 dice to complete an album for the same set I got 475 for previously? Plus y’all had the audacity to put a gold sticker in each set and STILL NOT MAKE IT TRADE-ABLE! And you heard ppl complaining about being scammed out of stickers yet again y’all don’t update that smh about to lose a lot of players,Going downhill
3,2023-08-30 20:16:17,"The game is fun very addictive, however I do think they should make it easier to close out the albums. Waiting weeks for one card is a bit ridiculous",Fun but….

1,2023-08-27 08:04:46,"After the update, is says my account was disabled... and I'm not sure how to get is reactivated... it's super disappointing that when you have over 2000 dice, the system glitches, and you're left with a whopping 134 dice... and no way to get them back. I will not be playing this game anymore, just ridiculous!!!",Pathetic
3,2023-08-26 22:55:11,This game is a waste for real. When you first start you’ll love it. Especially If you’re playing with friends but after awhile you’ll hate it. Play at your own risk.,Don’t even bother

1,2023-08-25 11:04:52,Cards for current tournament are almost impossible to get fulfilled. Fb page for “trading” cards hosts a lot of scammers and spam. I’ve spent around $30 on the game so far and cannot advance. I have friends that have done the same. I’m not really sure how this has nearly 5 stars on the App Store.,Gimmick for in app purchases

Absolute trash, honestly just don’t even try it.",Sad state of our apps nowadays
1,2023-06-02 18:34:55,I can’t even access my game!!! Someone else’s account took over my profile and I completely lost mine and I’ve been trying to get support for 3 days to recover my account and apparently no one works there!!!! Until my stuff is fixing I highly do not recommend this game!!!! You won’t get help!!!,No support!!!

1,2023-05-17 21:29:35,"Completely copied version of board game except they changed the graphics to monopoly based things.

3,2023-11-01 22:38:24,I don’t understand why we can’t use the Monopoly money that we earn to buy more dice ykwim ? Like we should have a shop where we can shop for dice for the money we have,Money
1,2023-11-01 17:28:17,I just deleted the app. It’s ridiculous the amount of times it says ERROR and it restarts the app. I’ve lost billions and I’ve lost so much progress today alone. I contacted customer support and all they do is ask for your email and nothing else happens. I’m done with trash game.,Too many problems

1,2023-11-01 15:48:07,This game is honestly just a money grab. The rolls are not random and are all pre mediated based on how well you have been doing. The game will put you at an disadvantage if it sees you “winning” or being successful in any type of way. Plus the amount of real money you have to spend for rolls is ridiculous.,Money Grab

1,2023-10-31 01:02:45,"This game is pretty cool but when they have tournaments and such you can only get far if you spend the money, which I'm not willing to do because it's just for fun.

I feel like there should be more options on how to ADD THEM with out being dismissed . Why is it a suggestion if I can’t add more people?

Why does Facebook need to be involved?   Very disappointing.  Thanks-",False advertisement
2,2023-10-19 03:06:26,Love the game but getting these cards for your set could be a little bit better more dice. Also fix the glitch on the dice links. Once I press collect or open on my dice are not be added out of nowhere😩 reason why 2 star,Game

1,2023-10-01 21:13:15,I have been playing awhile and learned that even if you bank heist in a higher multiplier the person doesn’t get taken out that amount of money.

Before I would have given 5 stars but they’ve disappointed me and my friends this go round.,Glitches a lot!
1,2023-09-10 08:57:46,First thing this isn’t a game. A game includes strategy in some form. This is an app pumping you to spend money. So many pop ups and when you play you just go around and collect stuff. You never buy a property nothing. Just more pop ups to spend money. Total waste. It should get zero stars.,Not a game
1,2023-09-09 02:55:36,Too many issues and bugs in the game. The last update made many unsatisfactory changes that made it impossible to move forward in the game without spending real currency. Not worth my time and most definitely not worth my money. ✌️,Not enjoyable anymore/money-grab

4,2023-09-07 19:06:17,I am a huge lover of this game but having and allowing 5 trades a day of cards does not make any sense whatsoever. I wish we are allowed to make more than 5,Love the game
5,2023-09-04 13:34:21,This is a great game. Only wish you had more than 5 sticker trades a day.  Otherwise nothing bothers me about it.,Great
1,2023-09-04 20:48:42,Game used to be so fun but they have become greedy and make it impossible to get dice without spending real money. I don’t want to pay money to play the game. Can’t advance to new levels without dice which you now have to pay for because the rewards are much lower. Super disappointed!,Greedy
4,2023-09-04 16:26:06,i would have put 5 stars but i think its kinda weird to have a limit on trading… and this is just an idea but maybe you could make the game let us give away dice if people need them😬 i just think it would be alot easier to play if you didnt have a trading limit and you could give your dice out to people that have none- just an idea,ideas…
5,2023-09-01 22:16:39,I don’t remember Tiktok monopoly go ad but I had to download the game monopoly go and it’s a good game without ads 10/10,Monopoly Go is the best game I’ve ever played

1,2023-09-01 06:02:25,Needs a lot of fixes they barely give any dice rewards are way too expensive to even make you wanna try getting 50 dice when I’m on board 146 is insane the amount of money everything cost just keep going up stickers are impossible to find,Do better
3,2023-08-31 01:50:21,Only issue I have with the game is all the pop ups when you are low on dice. The pop ups are on the screen to the left and if Don’t need to be reminded,Pop ups

5,2023-08-16 00:45:26,usually i’m like this game has way to many ads or i hate the ads but there isn’t a lot of ads in this game i saw it all the time on the ads of games and stuff like that until i was like omg fine i’ll download it and omg it’s so fun i’ve been playing this for 6 hours straight lol but yeah overall great app ! 5/5 sincerely-from me,great game
2,2023-08-27 00:33:35,I’ve spent soooooooo much money on this game!!!!! Just to be stuck at the end. I think the developers know who’s spending the cash and keep them at a certain point just to bleed more money out of them. Smh. If it wasn’t for that I’d definitely give 5 stars.,Mixed feelings
4,2023-08-26 03:04:55,"We should be able to buy dice with play money  , and y'all need to gift more stickers that we need , and not so much duplicates",It's cool or whatever
2,2023-08-24 17:50:29,So during the unlimited treasures with the 3.99$ I bought it it’s says it purchased successful I clicked ok then it said can’t be purchased try again later 10-20 mins later I tried again still the same thing. Pls fix,Scammed
1,2023-08-24 03:02:04,It starts off good and then it turns into a grind just to earn dice and money. You don’t get the right amount of dice for the grind. I opened over 8 sticker packs and only received two new stickers. So many mini transactions are promoted so that’s how you know it’s pay to win. Definitely not for a casual gamer.,Pay to win
2,2023-08-23 20:19:44,"I loved this game but to lose 1.6 billion from a player who’s unknown just doesn’t sit right with me. It takes a lot to earn your bank, and to have it completely wiped out by one player is disheartening. I can’t play this anymore.😩😫😡😩😫😡😩😡",Losing all my money
4,2023-08-21 20:59:32,Great game but they need to cut down on all the animations or make it option to stop animations cause even on newer iPhones it’ll lag. Too much animations and they go so slow,Good game
1,2023-08-19 23:12:14,Repeating stickers past 3 is a waste of Players time and money (if they pay). We play to move ahead and to get more rolls. We save our stickers to get better stickers.  But if your trade all 4 and 5 star stickers and get 3 and 3 stars that you already have then why am I️ playing.   Im done and deleting the game.,Repetitive stickers
4,2023-08-19 21:33:03,What’s the point of winning 400 shields or however many if we’re only allowed to keep the amount the game allows?,Little things annoy me
4,2023-08-16 14:58:55,It’s a great and fun way to play online monopoly with friends and family BUT it’s also a great way to create enemies with them lol. Either way still a great game and it’s fun to play.,Great and Bad
5,2023-08-15 15:22:50,More gold cards,Very good game only thing I can say is I wish there were more gold cards
2,2023-08-15 20:11:01,I’m only writing this because i think we should be able to send messages in game because i have some serious words to say to the person who didn’t help me finish building my car.,I need to message people.
5,2023-08-12 02:21:19,I absolutely am obsessed with playing this game. I wish there were tones of these games. I highly recommend this game.,Cool Game!
3,2023-08-15 11:30:15,For example: -More dice when you move to the higher boards  -Better sticker rewards the non gold cards shouldn’t be that difficult to get -Fix that some people can choose to attack your board multiple times in a row but you can only get revenge because they don’t show in your friends list  -being able to trade gold cards  -maybe revenge for bank heist as well 🤷🏽‍♀️,Needs some improvement
4,2023-08-14 16:46:21,This may be the best game on my phone you can win prizes and when you land on railroad you can steal some money or destroy some of their buildings and get money it’s so fun and I love this game,So much fun
5,2023-08-07 11:10:34,I get a rush playing this game reminds me of the little Facebook games a few years back . It’s just like thug/mafia wars,Addicting
5,2023-08-07 00:42:05,This game is so fun. Especially when playing with family and friends,Monopoly
5,2023-08-05 13:31:19,It’s trash. Soon as you start clearing all the boards the game constantly crashes. Don’t recommend,Dodo
5,2023-08-03 16:07:19,The only thing is how you get banned from trying to trade cards and it is for only trying to trade so I am unsure why,Cool game
3,2023-08-04 05:33:12,The game would be way better if it didn’t take so long for dice to reload and you get so many of the same cards and can’t trade gold cards is kinda dumb!,Takes too long to get dice
5,2023-08-03 02:08:51,The game just keeps me occupied at least three times a day. I wish I had unlimited dice 😂,My favorite
5,2023-08-03 00:12:02,"I love this game, BUT I wish we could trade good cards. Will there be a special going on where gold cards are tradeable? That will greatly be appreciated.",Love this game
5,2023-08-01 11:27:48,Me personally I’m huge fan of monopoly and I’ve always played with my family so this game is really fun to me and I really enjoy it a lot.,Game Review
5,2023-07-31 18:50:22,"Great for passing time, bored moments! I definitely recommend this game to even play with friends too!",Addictive
5,2023-07-29 22:00:27,"If you’re looking for a daily progression game, this is a must have 😃👍.",More than what I expected
4,2023-07-31 13:58:08,I give it 4 because it isn’t like real monopoly because you have to bail yourself out but in the real game you just role a double that’s all,Why i rate it a 4
5,2023-07-28 21:57:27,I love the game but y’all should make it where we can give each other dice please and thanks.,This game❤️
3,2023-07-28 23:25:49,This is a really fun game and gets a lot of people involved but if your gonna advertise trading on Facebook I think there should be a check balance system to prevent getting scammed out of cards.,Trading Needs Work
5,2023-07-20 03:33:56,"Love this game! Great concept for phone! Have always loved monopoly, now I have people to play with!",Just like the original
4,2023-07-24 21:22:30,I love it but WHY can’t we trade the gold rimmed stickers? It’s already hard to get them! All we keep getting is the same stickers and no new ones,Love it
2,2023-07-21 13:36:32,I just want to say love this game but today I can’t login in restarted even deleted the app yet error still pops up… when loading stops at 30% stops then error pops up on screen i hope they fix this,Login in
3,2023-07-20 13:46:01,Rolls take too long to regenerate and it should be a way to gift friends rolls daily. I dont have many friends to add and don’t have money like that to buy rolls to keep playing. So I love playing it when I can.,Rolls
5,2023-07-19 20:22:42,"You will always need more dice, you always have an agenda… you don’t run out of fun!",Highly addictive
5,2023-07-18 03:59:54,Me And my mom can play together and I have Soo much fun I think you should make a another game,Why I have a five star
5,2023-07-15 19:06:34,Two days in and off ..so easily I play ..and keeps the speed of the game interesting…!,Hooked
1,2023-07-15 21:31:44,This game only rolls what it wants you to. Always missing key rolls either adding or taking away one digit from what you’ve rolled. It’s extremely annoying. Thank goodness I haven’t spent a dime on this game like I have others because from what I can see and with frequent updates it is most certainly rigged!,Rolls are rigged!
5,2023-07-14 06:31:58,The game is absolutely genus as long as they keep updating it and keeping it running like this I’ll keep playing,Monopoly
1,2023-07-13 04:00:57,"I was enjoying this game until recently when the bank heists started coming out of our banks! I watched mine go from $20,000 to $0 in seconds! I’ll NEVER be able to build waiting an hour for dice and other players taking money from me from the heists in the meantime. Please change it back!!",Bank Heists ughhh
5,2023-07-12 00:27:56,Something new to play and enjoy with friends!!!,Easy plays
5,2023-07-10 22:27:11,"Why lately does this game keep glitching? It won’t open, it’s been just shutting off on its own. Please Fix!!!! 😩🤯",Whitney 1229
5,2023-07-07 01:06:04,I love it so much I downloaded it today and it’s the best. Seriously I fell in love. You can play it anywhere. I’ve already done 5 levels.,MONOPOLY
3,2023-07-07 07:39:38,Just wish we had something to turn our cash money for dice it’s hard to keep interest when the amount of dice is so little .  Or increase the amount of dice earned an hour .,Nice game very fun
5,2023-07-06 19:14:05,Love this game but it keeps freezing and kicking me out! It’ll load to 30% and say there an error,Love it
1,2023-07-06 21:19:48,Yea hi I love the game and it’s addicting but my game keeps on freezing from where I left off at and it just freezes. I tried updating it and nothing worked. I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it puts me to where I was left off at and it freezes. It is really getting annoying,Game freezing
5,2023-07-05 22:04:49,Yo y’all need to fix this fr it’s been crashing all day and loading to 30% please fix it. Overall the game is amazing,Monopoly go aggy
1,2023-07-06 12:48:18,"The game was fun; they have no problem collecting money but the second the game glitches no resolution. For two days I have been stuck in community chest… lost all my rankings, board destroyed, money all robbed, daily bonuses and all tournaments just gone… and not one response, nothing had been done.",Poor customer service
4,2023-07-05 23:12:39,Love the game when it works. I am constantly getting error after error!!!!! Please update to stop errors.,To many errors
1,2023-07-05 22:23:16,Great game until it crashed on community chest open it’s bugged out to where it has me hit the start button to select friends but button doesn’t work I closed the app and opened back up hose straight to chest an dose the same thing even uninstalled an reinstalled same thing please fix,Crash
3,2023-07-05 22:08:27,"I love this game. Unfortunately since the update, I am unable to play and keep losing (not my money) money/dice due to unexpected closing of the apps. Please fix this, I really enjoy this game. Thank you",Love but Restarting every time i play
5,2023-07-05 20:40:36,I loved this game and since the update all it does is crash.,Crashes
5,2023-06-22 23:12:49,This is a nice twist on the game. I do wish there was a rules section so that you can understand what actions cause certain results.,Love It!
1,2023-07-05 20:22:14,Still needs fixing. Can play for ten minutes and it will kick u off the game. And wen you go to reload it it stops at 30% and sets there and will kick you off again a few time before the game will load all the way up fully for you to play,Still needs fixing
2,2023-07-05 19:43:40,I’ve been able to play this game for all of one day before “error caused game to restart” became my title screen. Now I can’t even get back into the game. Will give good review when fixed. I’m losing time on challenges and events because of this!,Crashes
3,2023-07-05 19:32:47,"Love the game overall, but it won’t let me get off community chest. I have deleted and reinstalled multiple times and still can’t get off that screen. It’s irritating.",App issues
1,2023-06-25 23:45:26,I am a little frustrated I really like Monopoly so the fact that all it does is do the loading screen at 9 percent was I little annoying I even just let it sit there for 2 hours and it stays on 9% so if they could fix that for whatever reason it's doing that I would be very grateful,Problem
3,2023-06-24 02:20:36,Good game too many opening ads to buy stuff though it’s annoying when I have to click away 6 ads before I play.,Good but ads annoying
5,2023-06-22 16:09:55,Good way to take up some time while waiting around,Time
4,2023-06-20 10:05:26,the pop ups are INSANE. love the game but relax i almost bought something multiple times! fun game though highly recommended,pop ups 😣

5,2023-06-15 02:31:23,Please increase the amount of sticker sending 5 is so little.,Sending stickers
5,2023-06-11 14:14:09,I would say this game is the great game to play especially if you want to play against family without the conflicts,Great fun game
3,2023-06-13 11:29:01,6-8 rolls an hour ? I think the entire 60 should replenish   Every time we are on our last roll we don’t want to fight with ads popping up asking us to spend money   The blank sticker rewards 😒 i got them 4 times and it’s annoying  We should have more space for shields it’s makes no sense to give us over the amount allowed and they just disappear 🙄  We should also be allowed to trade as much as we want,I like it but
5,2023-06-06 18:15:48,So far I am loving this game but what is kinda annoying is that you have a limit of dices to but overall it is a good game,I love it
5,2023-06-01 19:57:11,The game’s amazing and the concept is great basically you go from different famous places like Venice and build your buildings there,Great game
5,2023-06-01 14:56:58,So much fun especially playing with friends!!! Amazing quality and best graphics I’ve seen in a game like this one.,Golden game
5,2023-05-22 01:01:01,I’m enjoying playing. Just wish it was ways to interact with my “ friends “ other then that I’m enjoying it.,Cool game.
4,2023-05-22 04:34:13,Love love love This game but the dice and timeframe is crazy though. We have to wait a whole hour for 6 or 7 dice. Please fix this!!! We need more dice and a less time frame!!!!,Need more dice less timeframe
5,2023-05-17 20:15:36,Good game so far. They really took some time to work out kinks. Hoping to see more in future updates!,Great so far!
4,2023-05-20 08:23:36,Much more like the original board version than the other games I’ve found and played in the App Store. Love it! Thank you!,None
1,2023-05-19 05:25:18,You already have to pay for for the game. On top of that when you run out of dice they still put up an ad to pay for more. You also have to pay for extra games and other things. Absolutely ridiculous prices for how boring this game is.,Money Money Money
5,2023-05-11 17:32:38,I think it should be ads to watch or something to get free spins also more spins for the Buck it’s like $4.99 for 50 spins that’s it,I need more SPINS for my Buck
5,2023-05-11 02:37:38,My older brother and I used to play the Monopoly board game when we kids. This app brings back so many great memories!,I love the Monopoly app!

1,2023-04-30 15:39:47,Don’t spend real money on this game !!!! I spent over 20 bucks to get money and build my area. I woke up and someone stole 3.8 million from my bank. Why would I spend real money to lose it the next day. I basically wasted my money. Stupid idea and a waste of my money. I’ll definitely be disputing those charges.,Money Heist
5,2023-04-28 19:12:01,The game is pretty cool I love how the game like gives you the inside of the actual game it’s something that I’ve always wanted,How fun is the game?

2,2023-04-24 15:58:41,"That game was fun, and looked like free to play was going to be cool, but then all of the mini goals ended just before I could get the large amounts of dice and leave you always trying to sell you more. Free to play gets you about 15 minutes a day of play.","Fun game, to much of a Money grab"

2,2023-11-01 17:46:11,Why does the game keep shutting down for everyone. We haven’t been able to do everything and with the wheel challenge about to end I don’t think it’s fair we can’t do anything. Please fix it,I don’t understand
1,2023-11-01 17:44:19,Game has errors and restarts causing you to lose progress anytime there’s an event going on. Customer service is no help I. These situations either. It’s a money grab game. They make it seem fun but you have to pay if you want to really play. Would rate 0 stars if possible,Too many bugs

1,2023-10-30 17:06:35,It started out being fun. I actually didn’t mind spending a few dollars every now and again. Now this game makes it almost impossible to get anywhere unless you’re paying for it. I won’t spend another dollar in this game. You ruined it for me,Not fun anymore
1,2023-10-26 21:27:46,How y’all gunna shut down the game and give everyone error messages right after you release the tournament to get the new ghost shield?! Players are spending crazy amounts of dice to try and get this new shield. Now no one can play your game and try to get the shield!!! You should gift all players the new ghost shield as an apology!!,Ghost Shield
5,2023-10-20 10:58:11,I love playing this game because it’s so much fun to demolish people’s homes (even though most of them have shields),Very fun game!
2,2023-10-26 07:36:01,"It was fun at first until you figure out you are being cheated on the dice roll and only advancing half of what you should be.  Also, when your multiplier is on you are cheated on the number of free rolls your supposed to win.",Cheating the player!
2,2023-10-21 23:49:19,Waiting an hour for a small number of dice is absurd and deterring also the amount of dice given at times are very small as well. I have also noticed that more dice were used than what I had my set to. I’m losing interest in the game.,…..
3,2023-10-20 22:42:50,I am not getting the correct spaces that I roll on my dice. I have lost out on a lot of free dice because of this  Not fair at all and I spend money on this game.  Needs to be together more. And I would love some compensation!!!!,Monopoly go

2,2023-09-28 00:07:35,"Fix the problems already. Its not fair that people can go weeks without new gold cards. It’s ridiculous and the pack everyone got that was suppose to have gold cards in, didn’t get new ones! Too many duplicates!!",FIX THE GAME PROPERLY.
1,2023-09-27 21:13:25,This game has been so glitchy. I have sent messages and instead of giving me back the stuff that I lost when the glitch happened you give sticker packs to everyone. I got duplicate of everything once again. I just thought this game would be fun. It stressful.,Glitchy
1,2023-09-27 14:06:50,"I played many days without building my city, collecting over 40-50 shields. I finally built my city and after only 4 attempts a player was able to destroy my building despite having a stockpile of shields.

1,2023-09-11 14:30:54,You run out of dice fairly quickly and earn them back very slowly. Some days I may have 100 dice for the whole day but it seems that every 3 days or so I’ll get lucky. Considering deleting it due to lack of chances to actually play and enjoy the game. They want you to buy dice.,Pay to play smh
2,2023-09-11 14:28:54,I love this game but every-time I’m about to get the final prize for the daily awards it starts the week over.  What’s the point of signing in everyday to reach that goal just to not get it on the final day. It’s frustrating please fix this!!!!!,Problems with rewards
1,2023-09-11 00:37:56,This game is fun. And the interplay with friends makes it even more fun. DO NOT make a purchase as they are designed to be a complete waste of your resources. Just be patient in whatever your situation. A random gift or daily win will provide you with 200 times the reward of any wasted money on this app.,Purchases are a WASTE!!!!
5,2023-09-10 18:22:03,I just started playing last night and it is a nice way to unwind from daily stress.,This is a fun game

1,2023-09-02 06:10:33,The September update made the game worse. The rewards for completing packs are abysmal while other players hack the game to achieve an infinite number of dice do you can’t compete in side competitions is completely ludicrous. Just shows that the game was rebuilt to extract money from players because of its significant growth,Beyond ridiculous
1,2023-08-31 17:00:36,I paid $60 for a missing guaranteed gold card and didn’t get what I was looking for it’s a scam and you all just want money and that is not right. That’s not how you run a buisness if you want to keep your coustmers coming back. You do not get an answer back for weeks I am beyond upset and want my money back ASAP,Scam
1,2023-08-29 00:30:35,The game is set up so you have to spend money to complete sticker albums and complete special events. I know so many people (myself included) who have spent so much time and money on this game to not get anywhere. It’s a fun game if you can actually play it.  A lot of folks are going to be deleting soon.,It’s rigged
1,2023-08-28 19:57:26,"I have a VERY hard time getting ahead or winning rewards when the game constantly takes away my earned tokens.

1,2023-08-26 17:31:26,"It’s fun but having to wait so long for dice is annoying. Also no one is completing the card sets, only being able to send 5 a day seems ridiculous. Should be at least 7-10. Playing x1 doesn’t get you far at all. It all seems like a scam so I’m deleting it.",Pay to play
3,2023-08-25 10:52:14,Holy cow I get wanting to increase the  pace of the game but this level of speed gives me anxiety. Take it back like three clicks and maybe cut some unnecessary animation instead of just cranking the speed up to 11.,Sloooooooooooooow doooooooooooooown
3,2023-08-24 07:55:44,I’m enjoying the game so far. But I hate any game that makes you wait hours or more just to have more lives/rolls/etc in order to keep playing.,It’s okay. But lack of rolls and wait time.
1,2023-08-24 21:25:37,"I’ve literally been hooked to this game for months. I would’ve rated 5 stars if it weren’t for the fact that I’ve needed three gold star stickers for 1 months now to compete the album, and the wild life tales finishes in 7 days.

2,2023-08-16 16:15:55,Please update the game to allow users to trade stickers in the game versus your facebook page! Please allow other users to view other users stickers in the game. Too many scammers and people charging other people for stickers on a FREE game. It's ridiculous.,Trades

Waste of money. I won’t have anything left by the time I get back in it.",Garbage!
1,2023-08-13 00:21:31,Beware purchasing items because it double charges you. I paid via Apple Cash and it still tried to charge my bank account. No way to get in touch with anyone to get the issues resolved.   Buyer beware. I love the game though but won’t make anymore purchases,Fraudulent charges
5,2023-08-11 01:27:07,This is the best game ever because it has no ads you can play against Facebook friends,The best
5,2023-08-08 23:27:06,The spin wheel is a joke. You use all your dice to advance and they have a 5 and 15 dice winning on that wheel. Why bother. Put a pink pack in there,Fun but....

4,2023-07-27 00:23:25,Fun game. Only criticism is that would be more convincing if I have it on auto roll and it lands on a railroad it should conduct on its own without me pressing collect. But other than that love the game.,👍👍👍
2,2023-07-26 19:33:15,The game itself is cool but it’s pretty much impossible to get the cards you need. I don’t want to go into a long monologue about the different things i hate about it; but the price you guys want for the amount of dice you will receive is OUTRAGEOUS !!!!!

1,2023-07-29 17:32:45,All this app does is give you the same duplicate stickers that you don’t need .. They just was want your money and the customer service team is the worst …  you can’t trade gold stickers but you need them to finish packages .. good luck getting them.. stuck waiting for 1 sticker for 4 weeks now ..:,Crooks
5,2023-07-27 19:27:48,Why does it have a 4.9 it should have a 5.0 rating download it now,It’s so fun to play me and  my friends love it🤩
5,2023-07-24 04:18:01,This game is fun to play with the whole family. My whole family has this app. Great cyber bonding lol,Entertaining
5,2023-07-21 13:06:08,"I love this game, I've spent money on this game, but it crashes and the updates aren't helpful!  Please help it get better!!",Love this game but...
5,2023-07-16 22:47:53,There's a lot to do with friends they made the graphics very vibrate and colorful great way to relax and rule the day 🗡️,Best board game app I've seen yet
2,2023-07-20 13:52:23,I started out loving the game ! But now it’s boring and no fun because we all are asking for the same cards and getting the same old cards in spins ! The dice given after an hour isn’t enough. The updates made it worse .,Overrated
1,2023-07-19 20:42:49,Don’t do it! It’s a money grab. The dice you receive at intervals is not even close to advance you in the game. You also don’t get new stickers. The algorithm keeps you from landing on the spaces you need as you get further in the game. You will basically be stuck if you don’t spend lots of money!!!!!!,Terrible!
5,2023-07-16 12:52:41,Really smooth animation and not so competitive it ruins the game when friends take your money,Fun to tap
1,2023-07-16 13:15:36,Should have had the building you build make you more rolls or money and shouldn’t take so long for the rolls to refill that’s and I don’t like that you can only trade 5 times a day 10 or 20 would have been better if you even have to have one at all,They should fix this
5,2023-07-15 01:48:31,Is like the casino I just wish we had more rolls for stuff,Addicting
4,2023-07-15 16:17:54,The dice runs out too fast and I keep getting multiple of the same stickers never the one I need,Update
5,2023-07-14 00:00:18,Definitely a time passer byer for a self paced work shift…only wish the time frame for rolls was shorter && u get more,Extremely fun
4,2023-07-14 12:25:10,Decent game so far only one complaint last set of stickers do not come out enough,Sticker issues
5,2023-07-09 21:40:23,I really love this game my cousin recommended it and i couldn’t stop playing after its really fun and competitive,Love it
4,2023-07-12 06:09:01,We should be able to give as much as we take because waiting an he for five rolls is a bit steep,Wait on rolls
4,2023-07-10 19:10:37,In all I love this game but my invite link does not work. All my friends said page can’t load. Would be nice if they fixed that,Good game but…
1,2023-07-10 16:44:02,"I don’t know how this has so many good reviews. It’s a horrible game, nothing like the original monopoly. You have no choice in anything the game basically runs automatically. Worst of all you get consistent pop up’s to pay for more dice rolls or fake money. Super money hungry and quite literally the worst game ever made.",Money hungry

3,2023-07-05 23:59:01,The game constantly shuts down or displays an error. Especially when you try shut down someone property. If it wasn’t for that I would rate the game 5 starz,Annoying

3,2023-06-20 11:55:15,"It’s entertaining but frustrating. 8/10 you get a shutdown instead of a heist. You always land one before or one after the tile you need. Game feels rigged. Rolled almost 400 in dice (10x, 40 rolls) & got shutdown 8 times & a heist once. Starting to feel very corny.",Eh.

1,2023-06-01 13:25:13,"The game is stacked against you unless you shell out actual money. And even then, the dice will not allow you to land on the spaces you need to get the “tokens” needed to gain more money, stickers, dice, etc.  I dealt with that aspect of the game and just kept in mind that if I wanted to have “fun” I’d have to spend actual money.   But then- I got some gay pride advertisement to purchase a “pride pack”….. so let’s talk about that. Pandering to the LGBTQAI+ community on a children’s game is weird. Slapping a rainbow flag on something to sell it is weird. After I saw that I deleted it immediately.   Not worth it for this pan girl.",Stacked
5,2023-05-30 16:06:55,"Omg this reminds me of my dad beating me in this game but in real life! I am so glad I found this! This deserves a award for best board game ever, Reminds me of my childhood! Amazing game of making a board game a reality.",Amazing game!

3,2023-05-17 00:12:02,"Well I thought it was a fantastic game at first but now not so much. Can’t get anyone to trade specific cards, because no one seems to have them and the game isn’t updating any new cards to people.",Hmmmm
4,2023-05-05 06:32:57,I like this game a lot but I wish ads could be watched to decrease the amount of time it takes to refresh dice or watch ads to get more dice,Great but!
1,2023-05-03 16:40:32,"The game loves to shove their deals in your face every time you log in, run out of dice, OH! And they keep asking for me to connect with friends!

1,2023-11-04 14:55:29,You have to pay to play. The game is rigged so you have to spend money. It would be better if they added mini games and stop controlling the spins. In addition they have to stop giving out duplicate stickers. Soon a lot of people will stop playing the game,One star rating
3,2023-11-04 04:23:49,"I love this game , don’t get me wrong.  But, why only give us one new card? Why can’t we get all 5 new ones???  Don’t get me started on the groups either , they’re no help.",One new card only? Ripoff
1,2023-11-03 10:53:07,This game is so glitchy now. It cuts off during almost every event preventing ppl from finishing so they won’t have to pay out. They when they come back with the “I’m sorry gifts” it’s nothing comparable to what you would’ve received had they allowed you to finish.,Glitchy

1,2023-09-11 19:42:33,The game is set up to be fun for like 7 mins. Than you’ll have to spend money to complete events. There is no way to actually enjoy the game with out being manipulated into spending money. The game needs to chill out a bit and quit being designed to be so money hungry.,You’ll spend money.
1,2023-09-10 15:36:15,This game used to be fun but they steal and cheat against players and when players reach out they get no response. I have two accounts and can confirm that when a heist/shut down is done the two amounts DO NOT match. I’ve landed on cookies and did not receive credit for them.  Getting closer and closer to deleting tbh.,TERRIBLE game

1,2023-09-09 03:07:52,"It was fun in the beginning but once you get to a certain level (beyond board 50), the game is rigged. It’s hard to keep advancing without paying money for dice. The rolls don’t land you where you need to land to get rewards and the sticker collection holds back on new stickers awards.",Pushes players hard to spend money
1,2023-09-08 23:26:19,This game has glitched on me several times while playing and I go to complain on customer service & nothing gets done. I’ve spun on x50 and have landed on the cookies enough to have I believe 600 and HAVEN'T received them back nor a reply from customer service. save your money & don’t download it!,GLITCH

1,2023-09-08 01:05:11,The rewards for finishing a sticker set is compared to almost nothing to what it used to be. The makers just want you to spend you real money to actually be able to complete anything. Might as well delete or dont even install the game. Extremely stressful and not enjoyable.,Joke!
2,2023-09-08 00:35:15,This game has so much potential but it is very glitchy and cheats you out of dice and rewards. I’ve sent several messages to support and I never get a response. Terrible customer service.,Full of glitches and no support
5,2023-09-06 02:51:33,I love this game almost like pirates on Facebook but it’s got better special effects and a little more like a board game,Awesome!

1,2023-09-05 19:56:51,"The best part of the game is attacking people. Come to find out the money you “steal” isn’t the players. Once you attack a single person 4 times you bypass shields and demolish buildings, refused less if they are online gaining more shields. Just all fake.

1,2023-09-05 03:24:00,DO NOT GET IT. I’ve spent so much money and my husband does not know. Just for some dice so I can play the game. I tell myself I need to delete it but I can’t bring myself to delete because I’m so addicted. My husband has told me to delete multiple times because I wake up and use my dice before doing anything else.,DON’T DO IT

1,2023-09-03 18:24:23,It seems like the more money I spend on the app the less rewards I receive. It’s clearly rigged to make me spend more. I use another phone where I don’t spend anything at all on this app and I win so much on there and my rewards are always bigger. So to compare the two it’s clearly rigged.,Rigged
5,2023-09-01 18:02:05,Loads of fun  but I just wish we could use the money in the game to buy more dice,😃

3,2023-08-25 20:03:43,I love EVERYTHING about the game. I spend hours a day on it. But I think not being able to share gold cards is dumb. And should be changed.,Not being able to trade gold cards is STUPID!
2,2023-08-29 22:00:32,"I would've left a 5 star review if we were able to trade gold cards 😒. Lucky you got 2 star rate for now, if things don’t change we the majority of the people will for sure be uninstalling this app.",Cards
1,2023-08-29 04:30:34,It was fun till they give you the exact same cards over and over and when you exchange 100+ cards to get new ones you end up getting more extra cards you already have. The amount of gifts they give you when you complete a goal is just unreal.,RIGGED

1,2023-08-25 04:42:58,There’s needs to be a safe way to trade stickers because there are so many players that are ripped off because the other player did not keep their word and send a card back or sent ones that were less stars than that was agreed upon.,Trading stickers
1,2023-08-24 22:28:10,I will NOT recommend this app until they actually start answering customers concerns.

1,2023-08-15 15:37:39,Every timeI roll it either adds 1 more or one less making me miss most of my good spots. Fix the game or give me some dice in replace cause this game is ridiculously rigged. Also some people have completed their album 3 times and I’m struggling to finish my first because of the dice rolls.,Dice rolls don’t match spaces moved ripping you off of good prizes.

1,2023-08-06 13:28:13,Wish I could give 0 stars. Played for over 2 weeks without 1 blue pack of cards; repeated green packs with the same cards. Not a fair platform if users can pay for progress with no accomplishments. Rolled a 2 but game only moved me 1 spot… I don’t use groups so guess I’ll start new game and lose all the bull crap.,Boring!

1,2023-07-27 23:36:45,The game is crazy rigged. They will on purpose not land on a certain tile when it comes close to getting your reward just so you can run out of dice and then buy more. I never ever in my entire life of all the games I played in this world never seen a rigged game like this. Save your time and finances trust me,RIGGED don’t bother downloading
2,2023-07-24 23:50:08,I really enjoyed the game..AT FIRST.. then the dice are sparse (so you have to spend money if you want to play). You struggle to get stickers to finish sets. You get multiple gold stickers and those CANNOT be traded. This game is quite addictive but I’ve learned to hate it.,Enjoyment left soon
1,2023-07-26 21:51:07,I have been playing for a while and gold stickers are rarely in the sticker packs and you can’t require them from others!

1,2023-10-20 00:10:22,"Last major patch they killed the rewards (gaining dice) and said it would be easier to finish. However, people still struggle to find the cards they need and it is impossible past board 75 to play without investing money.  They ruined what could possibly be a great game.",Horrible Game
3,2023-10-15 17:28:43,This game is cool and everything but getting the same stickers takes the fun out of it.  Not being able to fill albums unless you pay is lame.,Game is cool but….
3,2023-10-14 20:54:00,I can’t seem to find anywhere on the game or in the App Store for the rules or how to play the game. It’s a lot of learn by doing. Would like some help on where to find this.,Rules and How to Play

There shouldn’t be trouble loading this app every two or three days.  I like this game. I don’t love it.  The rewards are a joke, compared to how hard and almost impossible it is to get to the next level. Give more rewards!

3,2023-09-26 21:53:06,"it’s simply too much of a pay to play game! the mechanics and design are fun, but you can really only realistically check in a couple times a day tops with SUCH long waiting time for dice ):",could be great

1,2023-07-29 15:26:05,Seems to me they have changed the luck of the rolls. Giving you a lesser chance to land on railroads and titles you need to complete/unlock new rewards and giving a chance to win more rolls to continue game plan.  My guess is to push people in purchasing more rolls but in turn has ruined the game…,Game is rigged

5,2023-07-19 21:39:18,Interesting game but it takes WAY TOO LONG to replenish rolls.  5 rolls after 60 MINUTES???   That is ridiculous!,40 Rolls takes 8 HOURS??????
2,2023-07-20 13:43:30,Was very fun until you get all these ads about buying dice and sticker packs. Even when you buy the sticker packs it’s a HUGE chance you won’t get what you need. Which makes it even worse.,Micro Transactions Ruined the game.
1,2023-07-20 10:44:00,It can be a fun game until you realize that it’s a scam. I feel like the software knows when you are about to use up your dice and there’s a a prize for a lot of dice so that you buy more to get that big prize. I understand the game is made was made to make money but I feel like it is a very greedy game.,SCAM

4,2023-06-27 14:12:35,Too many purchase option pop ups in game  and the animations are too long.,Adjustments need made
3,2023-06-27 03:12:27,i really really love this game and i’m not the type of person that gets into games at all but i play this one. i love the original monopoly game so of course i love this one but the running out of dice so fast part and then not getting enough to keep going for a little while is what’s going to make me lose interest in the game. i’m not asking to have ever ending nice of course not but you don’t get enough at a time to go long enough.,the dice.
3,2023-06-26 14:38:38,"This game cheats so bad , especially during bank heist to get you to spend money. They lie about the amount of money someone actually took from you so they can bankrupt you.",Used to love it
4,2023-06-22 22:50:22,"After a couple of weeks, I have updated the stars. It really is a fun game!! Addicting I might add, lol. Lot of pop ups every time you go into the game buy fun.",Fun!

4,2023-06-12 20:20:58,5 SENDS ISNT ENOUGH We have almost 2 1/2 months worth of days to finish these sets but if you have no rolls or daily sends to get stickers people wont help you trade atleast put it up to 10. AND PLEASE STOP SPAMMING THE PROMO PAY PACKETS EVERY TIME I GET ONLINE 😭,UPDATE THE DAILY SEND LIMIT
2,2023-06-12 19:27:08,Love the game but the further along you get the bots hit you. I got hit by the same person 6 times in like 5 minutes. Definitely rigged. No way that it just randomly picked my map every time. I’ve noticed it getting worse.,Bots
5,2023-06-11 18:05:53,Just wondering why there isn’t a tournament right now?,Where is the latest tournament??

1,2023-06-01 15:14:24,You can’t even enjoy a game without them shoving the sexuality agenda down your throat. Let people just play a simple game without this rainbow crap everywhere! Until you’re going to be equal for all and support heterosexuality and create features for that don’t put this alphabet club crap in a game. Leave it out!,Groomers

1,2023-05-24 12:11:37,Community chest is useless and you need to Invite friends to unlock it which makes spaces useless otherwise. The amount of popups what appear when you run out of dice is crazy. Buy this…buy that… $1.99 for like 5 rolls is crazy. This game is not F2P friendly.,Too many adds and blocked content
3,2023-05-21 00:25:56,Game is really fun. But can you please get rid of the notifications that say “Revenge”. This world is difficult enough. Can we just enjoy the game without making it about revenge?,Please get rid of revenge language

2,2023-05-17 02:30:43,Three people has joined using the link I sent them however the app still shows I haven’t invited anyone and I did not receive any of the rewards. I also joined using someone link and it did not show them I joined,Referral link
1,2023-05-16 21:46:18,Loved the game but now locked out of it until I put in payment information. Won’t put in payment info because Apple continuously takes money for Apple TV even though I’ve canceled several times. Can’t wait to go back to Samsung,Makes me enter payment info to play
5,2023-04-24 02:22:20,"I absolutely love this game!!!! First my dad told me to try playing it and now my whole family is!!!!!! We all love this game, it is very addicting 😆",LOVE IT

4,2023-04-23 15:38:56,Very fun until you run out of rolls. Then you just have to wait 12 or so hours before you can play again.,Awesome but…
5,2023-11-11 00:38:14,Guys if you download this your gonna have a change of life Monopoly  go is the best game ever so makeshore you download this and tell me if I’m right,BEST GAME EVER
5,2023-11-07 17:08:03,This game is very fun and exciting to play. It’s you classic childhood monopoly but with a twist. Would recommend to pass the time.,Great game
3,2023-11-10 01:51:09,"MOGO, been enjoying the game. Frequently during mega heists when I land on the person, the game doesn’t allow the mega heist version. This has a big impact on tournaments. Need to do better in this department.",Mega Heist Not Connecting
4,2023-11-06 17:39:50,The amount of time ads get thrown in your face is way too much! I quit !,Ads are so annoying!
1,2023-11-04 12:42:52,You have to click 50 different x buttons for when you run out of spins. It’s the most annoying thing and I’m honestly going to uninstall it because it’s so annoying. Like if it only asked once fine. But 4 times I have to say no to spending money is a joke,POP UP SIMULATOR
5,2023-11-01 16:32:31,Can’t complete the composition due to this error what’s going on,Sorry for the interruption
3,2023-11-03 20:36:21,Those 50 free dice you get for completing a board should be going up! Maybe not every level but atleast every other. Spend to much money completing a board for 50 free dice.,Rolls per board you finish.
3,2023-11-02 18:28:45,"The game use to be a lot more fun. Now they have made it to where you HAVE to spend money to get cards. Also, think there should be more games like the cakes and cars",Fun
2,2023-11-02 16:44:53,I noticed when I purchased coins it deliberately skip you so you run out dice fast and need to spend more money for wait an hour for 8 free dice. The game could be fun if they not cheating and making people spend more money,cheats
2,2023-11-02 15:51:42,The game was fun at first. You only accumulate 8 dice per hour. Those 8 dice go very quick. The amount it cost to buy dice is insane for the amount you get. Just a waste. I’ve lost a lot of dice through the crashing as well.,"Little dice gain, big cost."
3,2023-11-02 04:43:27,The game would let me go around and collect but every time I purchased property it would reset. In the mean time my money got stolen and properties got shut down.,I’ll have to quit
2,2023-11-02 02:09:59,App crashed repeatedly during completion of cars in car show. I’m maybe getting one to two mega heists a day… however I’ve been the target of over 6 billion dollars in heists for less than 5 hours,App crash
5,2023-11-01 16:03:18,Every time I upgrade my buildings it says error and kicks me off the game,Monopoly go
5,2023-10-30 22:49:03,I love being able to collaborate with my friends,Fun with friends
5,2023-10-29 18:33:10,Worst app ever every time it’s on of those tournaments I don’t receive my prize I hate how this game is set up..,MonopolyGO
1,2023-10-30 11:56:59,This game honestly used to be soooo much fun. They’re making it almost impossible to progress in this game. Events used to be fun but now it just seems like a money scam. I’ll be deleting this game. There will be another that comes along similar that won’t exploit people’s interest.,Disappointing!
1,2023-10-30 04:51:27,It’s annoying when you triple down on a partners tournament and it gives you the LOWEST amount of points each time. On top of none of the partners who invited me have helped and so it’s annoying these tournaments can’t even be enjoyed. im not gonna put another penny into this app,Game is rigged to spend more
1,2023-10-30 01:32:36,It used to be fun but now you cannot succeed in the game or above others unless you spend money. Makes it extremely difficult and hard in those of us that just want to play a game like normal humans do. And not spend our paychecks on it,"Too hard, money hungry, not any fun"
1,2023-10-29 23:20:12,In have2 different accounts one link to my facebook another to my iPhone and now my accounts link to each other and I cannot get my other account back plz help as I have a lot of progress on my main acc 😤,Facebook connection issues

5,2023-10-20 09:38:54,"I live this game so far! Very entertaining and fast paced, keeps me busy during the day when I’m free to play!",Great Game!!
1,2023-10-22 22:37:25,If you’re going to encourage people to trade cards there needs to be some kind of protection for people trading especially within the Facebook group that is also promoted. I just lot my one 5 star card that I could have traded to completely finish a set. Trading is very flawed,Scammers
3,2023-10-16 22:37:50,Actually addicting lol but I just wish there was a way to send & receive dice from friends! Like we can do with stickers. That would be awesome!!!,"Love the game, would be better if"

3,2023-09-28 12:29:53,I get a mega heist and the app goes “sorry something happened forcing the app to restart” then when it restart its a shut down instead of bank heists at all. How is that fair 😭,Bugging out

1,2023-09-27 14:23:31,This game is so fun but so annoying at the same time unless you spend money on this game you can do a lot and for you to only get 7 dice an hour is freaking crazy it’s a fun game don’t get me wrong but enless you spend money you won’t be able to play the game consistently,Pay to play
1,2023-09-26 22:51:50,The stickers are too hard to get game play is slow as you only get 6-8 rolls an hour extra dice are almost impossible if you don’t want to spend money then this is not the right game for you it was fun in the beg but it is almost impossible to level up,Game
1,2023-09-25 00:23:47,Still nothing from you all as far as help these tournaments are getting out of control not even an hour in and people who spend money is taking over the game and not allowing others who can’t afford to do so in the dust and without rewards.,Tournament

1,2023-09-14 04:41:25,I wish there was a “Do not Show Again” button for the constant pop ups begging me to spend money on dice or invite friends to the game.   Feels like i’m being pressure to buy more dice. Lucky i’m not that addicted to the game to buy more dice but it be nice to choose whether I want to see the ad or not.,Love the Game But…

2,2023-09-08 21:01:53,"Its a good game, the problem is you only get 8 dice every hour, not enough to really do anything. You spend most of the time waiting on dice and it goes just like that. You have to pay if you really want to play the game 😔",🎲
1,2023-09-07 21:25:23,"This game was good… until they made it so you have to get a gold card in every set, give you no new cards even when you PURCHASE sticker packs and now just look for ways to make the game harder so you have to buy stuff. Money hungry never wins.. I won’t be playing anymore.",Was good
1,2023-09-03 03:06:52,Always losing progress dice and money (not from heist)with the new stickers. Monopoly won’t make it up I’ve tried multiple times even sent photos. Bought cards and rolls though the game and my card was hacked. It’s only used for apple. Not an Apple Card.,Lose progress
