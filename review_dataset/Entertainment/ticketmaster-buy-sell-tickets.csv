Unlike other sites like live nation, Ticketmaster is trustworthy. It is easy to set up an account on the app as well as customizing made profiles. it is useful for storing purchased concert tickets as well as the receipt, not to mention listing all the updated health guidelines for certain venues due to COVID-19. Another thing about Ticketmaster that I think is pretty cool is the ability to leave a review on a certain music event that has previously been attended too. ive never had a bad experience w/ using the Ticketmaster app. i wish i would of known more about Ticketmaster back when i did have a bad experience with buying fake tickets and having to re-purchase valid ones. The only other pro i have left to add w/ the others ive mentioned already is that if subscribed to receive emails from Ticketmaster, the app is usually on point w/ updating accounts to notify signed up members about nearby shows depending on their profile’s saved locations as addresses on it there.",Ticketmaster over everything!

1,2023-11-05 02:02:29,"While the app is fairly easy to navigate and isn’t too hard to use, the services of Ticketmaster are rather horrible and what may be considered predatory. I have bought tickets once from here and my mother once as well. When my mom bought the tickets, they tried offering to cancel them without any communication from our side to do so. While this would be fine in a setting where there was an issue or if we might’ve mentioned such a thing, we did not ever indicate that we wanted our tickets cancelled. Fortunately in that situation nothing happened, which I couldn’t say the same for my purchase. My girlfriend and I bought two tickets to a concert 3 days before it, then on the SAME day as the concert, Ticketmaster voided the tickets themselves an hour before it started without any communication and reason to. Imagine had we went to the concert and had been stranded because they voided our tickets without our knowledge. Our card was fully charged for the FULL amount of both tickets. When we called support, didn’t even care to give us an answer. They forced a refund to us after endless back and forth, ignoring the fact we traveled to attend. Providing a service only to void that service after compensation is a very predatory and shady practice. In addition they don’t guarantee refunds, so there’s a chance if this happens to you, you will be conned out of your money.  I would not recommend this service, even if you’re really desperate for tickets.",Be careful using this App
1,2020-01-23 23:16:37,"So, I log onto Ticketmaster to purchase 2 tickets to an upcoming concert. Find the show no problem get the tickets I want no problem. When it comes to placing the order it says, you must log on to use express checkout payment method. Oops on me, forgot to log on. So I log back on and ‘Place Order’ and it tells me the same thing. Okay. Let me close the browser and delete all cookies because the website is dumb. Did all of that and try again. Sign into my account and go to ‘Place Order’ still the same error.  Okay maybe I’m an idiot. Let’s try from the phone. Go go onto the app, where I’m signed into my account, see the show I want to purchase tickets for. What do you know?? Clicked the show I want and it just gives me a blank white screen for 15 minutes.  Alright so know I have to attempt to speak to customer service. I click through everything and when I get to the Contact Us page there’s numerous ways to attempt to contact them, email, letter, live chat, numbers for already purchased tickets, and a Call Us section. Do you think they left their customer service number under the Call Is section??? Nope they did not. So onto of all the extra money I have to spend per ticket, their website and app does not function properly. If you can stay away from ever using this monopoly to purchase tickets.   In the end I created a fake email so I could log on and purchase my 2 tickets. I guess if you want everything to work just keep making fake emails.",App is Bad Website is Even Worse

Immediately after I paid, it came up that I have my tickets for Monster Jam in Ohio. Ok, well…….. I live in Indiana. Yes, I chose the wrong event. I would think that if the same event, on the same day, & at the same time they would make sure you knew which event you had chosen instead of everything being in “fine print” until after you hit the purchase button. I even purchased the insurance. I immediately sent an email and pretty quickly received one back saying do not send another email because it will mess everything up and blah blah blah. So I wait two days and hear nothing on what I can do. So my only other option is to “sell” my tickets through Ticketmaster, hope someone purchases them as well as taking a “hit” on what I paid because Ticketmaster has to make more money off of me, & then purchase the correct tickets for where I live because the event is in 2 days and I have to make sure I have tickets to this event.

1,2023-01-16 01:35:52,"What an utterly useless app. Other Ticketmaster users can transfer a ticket to you (and you must have a Ticketmaster account to accept them). However, when you accept your tickets, you can only access them after logging into the Ticketmaster website. They DO NOT appear in your “my tickets” tab of the app, even if you tap the link to “refresh to view your tickets” and not even if you log completely out of the app and log back in. The Ticketmaster app does not work at all if you are using a VPN, so if you care about network security or privacy, you can’t use the Ticketmaster app. Want to add a ticket that was transferred to you to your Apple Wallet so you don’t have to fumble around with a congested cellular network at a venue? Nope. Can’t do that if the tickets were transferred to you, even though the app prompts you with a warning that you should transfer your tickets to Apple Wallet (and warns you that screen shots of your tickets don’t work). So literally, what is the point of the Ticketmaster app? What DOES it do correctly?  Oh, one more thing. The “give feedback” option in the app? Yeah, that doesn’t work either. The “contact us” option just above “give feedback” does work, but it just opens a “help” article that does not give you any way to actually contact Ticketmaster. In summary, the app doesn’t work, Ticketmaster doesn’t care, and you can’t tell them about it.","Worst App: Doesn’t Show Transferred Tickets, Can’t Use VPN"
1,2023-07-13 15:41:27,"I wanted to attend a concert on June 17th and I was driven to download the AXS app to make the purchase, everything worked fine with the transaction until I arrived at the venue and the tickets had disappeared from the app and even though I had email receipts for proof of purchase the people at will-call could not help me which is understandable since they work for the venue and not AXS. I ended up spending hundreds of dollars, and two hours travel time to be told I could not enter the venue. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with at any venue and to add insult to injury, I created a support ticket through the app and received an email confirmation with a request number and we’re almost a month later and no one from AXS has contacted me yet. This is another reason why you should steer away from this app unless you must have the app and you spend the $6.25 surcharge for picking up your tix through will-call (not that I recommend giving AXS more revenue through surcharges). Btw, I’m a power user of apps so this isn’t coming from a person who’s technically challenged and I always give credit where credit is due but if an app has a bug that can cause a glitch like this and tech support does not acknowledge, I feel it’s my duty to communicate that to others so they don’t have a similar experience.

1,2022-07-11 01:00:59,"So I'm traveling to Vegas for an anniversary with my wife. I booked tickets for a show in July. While I was attempting to check out, the Ticketmaster app had an issue with my use of a VPN on my phone. I shut off the VPN and went to check out. I purchased but then was surprised to discover that the date had changed to January. I don't know 100% if the VPN switching caused the dates to change or if I made an error on the month. In the end it really shouldn't matter. I immediately contacted customer service. That's when the nightmare began. First off, there is no number to call. Everything is via email or a chat that takes an average of three to six hours between responses. I was willing to purchase more expensive seats, I was willing to pay more for the same seats, but under no circumstances was I allowed to exchange for the correct date. I was told I should sell the tickets myself to someone else and then use that money to buy new tickets but that they weren't responsible if I didn't get paid. This was not an option for me since my travel for the event was the next day. I have never experienced such awful customer service nor had a worse customer outcome from a known company. I feel like I've been defrauded $500. I literally cannot believe this happened. I will never use Ticketmaster ever again. I cannot recommend that anyone else use it either.","Lost $500 to Ticketmaster, feel defrauded"

That was impossible as that was the time I entered the fair with my family and the tickets in transfer mode couldn’t be scanned as they were in green. My daughters missed the concert as I did too because I had to go to the entrance to try to resolve the situation. They were not allowed in. I am extremely furious about the situation.

1,2022-01-18 21:37:23,Very very disappointed with Ticketmaster. I was looking for Coldplay tickets and signed up for the presale. Kept getting emails etc saying I may not get tickets and I have to hurry once it’s my turn and then once it was my turn in the presale a clock was running down and I had 1 minute or so to complete the order. The part that I’m annoyed with the absolute most is that this scam company didn’t open all the seats for sale. Only the expensive ones and grayed out the entire top section saying no tickets available indicating they are already sold out. Because I really wanted to see their concert I took the bait and bought tickets for $250 each thinking and believing them that tickets are almost sold out. A day later they opened up the general sale and to my surprise I saw that all the grayed out seats were now available for well below $100. Even the tickets next to the ones I bought were $70 cheaper. What the heck Ticketmaster!!!!! This is absolutely disgusting and I will never ever in my life buy tickets from you again. Telling me I have to act fast and lying that tickets aren’t available and the next day you sell thousands of them is not ok. Never felt so lied to and disappointed with a company ever before. All the joy of getting tickets went away and turned into anger. Thanks! You have lost a customer forever.,Rip off

We were shoved into queue after we have checked into the “waiting room” way before start time. We get in and are told there are “2000+” infront of us. We sat there for 30 minutes with no movement and suddenly got in to pick tickets. I say that in a joking manner because buying tickets was IMPOSSIBLE at that time. We see tickets fading and coming back and we don’t even see that same tickets available for each of us when they do appear. We watched ticketmaster PRICE GOUGE THEIR OWN TICKETS. Due to high demand it’s okay to take tickets that were ~$60 and make them $3250?! What the actual…? Oh, and to make it even funnier: we all also tried buying tickets for different venues and guess what?! SAME STORY. Ticketmaster does NOT care about fans nor groups that they sell tickets for. They are greedy lowlifes who want to feed off of the desperation of fans. The groups and the fans deserve better. I have never wanted fans to band together and sue the pants off of someone more than I have today.

My mother doesn’t use a wheelchair, but she can’t easily take a large flight of stairs, either. Then our accessible seats were exactly opposite the accessible entrance, so after wearing herself out climbing stair with considerable assistance, she had to walk halfway around the coliseum to reach her seat.

Later that day, many more tickets were available but only about a third of them were listed as a ‘verified’ reselling of the ticket but the rest didn’t say they weren’t new, while all the tickets were 3-4 times the price of the original.

I paid 7x the price that people are getting for a fraction of what it was originally sold for. Ticketmaster monopolized and control ticket prices whenever they want and I think someone needs to stand up against this giant business because they are seizing money and making up “agreements” to trap everyone into paying their outrageous prices. I’ll be writing to the Better Business Bureau BBB and contacting my credit card to dispute this problem. Ticketmaster is trash 🗑",Ticketmaster SCAM PLEASE READ

When it works, it’s super convenient to have the tickets on your phone, but I’ve had the app crash on me several times at events which leaves me scrambling to get my ticket somehow pulled up (sometimes switching to the browser site works) which is stressful when you’re stuck outside of your section for restroom breaks or concessions runs. We’ve had issues transferring tickets to others via the app too so whoever bought them is sometimes stuck running out with anyone else in the group who needs a break or lending them their phone. They also jack up the fees on the tickets so that they’re often 25% of the total cost—I understand that they deserve a cut for handling the transactions, but I hate that a 1/4 of what I pay goes to them instead of the artist or the crews doing the actual work to make the show happen. It is what it is, though. Can’t say other ticket apps are much better.",Convenient app (when it works) but the fees are outrageous

But my concert is in 9 days and i have 0 information on where my tickets are. Their only customer service option is email and live chat, live chat is entirely broken and will not connect you and email takes  multiple days-weeks to get a response if youre lucky. I emailed once the timeframe of 10-14 business days passed and i hadnt recieved a shipped notification let alone the tickets and All i was told is we do not handel shipping or printing of tickets if they do not arrive  within 48 hours of your event please change delivery method to will call. But how the heck can i trust a company that cant deliver tickets in a month and a half  or respond to an email inquiry in less than a week to make proper arrangements in less than 48 hours. i will definitely be using stubhub for all of my future events and i encourage you to do the same",Ticketmaster is pretty much a scam

I bought tickets for my whole family, spending a considerably significant amount of money, and what did I receive…? Nothing, absolutely nothing. I’ve been trying to contact customer service and received nothing but silence. (Mind you the concert is tomorrow). For a company of this size, lacking a feasible, workable system that can successfully facilitate customer satisfaction and aid is just absurd and embarrassing. I have tried everything but only came across a fake customer service number online that scams people. And what did they do, oh let me remind you, nothing!

My tickets would get delivered to me when the show got closer. Waited patiently til the show was merely 1 weeks away. Still no tickets. After my anxiety about having my tickets kept building and building, I wanted to talk with someone from Ticketmaster but it’s like detective work just trying to get in touch with them. They have no phone number, no live chat, and nonexistent management of their email support. I even reached to their support account on Twitter and even that didn’t work. If you google this problem you will see tons and tons of people sharing their awful experience with this company and how they failed to provide them with refunds, tickets etc. NEVER buying from them again.

I have reached out many times recently again and again, and have not heard back from them.

In addition, if prepaid parking is selected, concert tickets must be mailed along w/ parking pass (but this is NOT apparent,) the system just Will not Process your order.

The problem I have with ordering from my phone is that the mobile application does not allow you to select the specific seat location that you want.  You have to take the 4 seats (or however many you are searching for) that the system finds for you.  I was wanting our seats to start on an aisle and even though the website showed the aisle seat was available, the mobile system would only give me 4 seats beginning from inside & working out toward the aisle. So lame! I understand why they want to sell the tickets in that manner, but why not put the needs of your customers first & allow the customer to dictate what seats they buy? What is the point of leaving one aisle seat open? Don’t drive people to your mobile app, where the customer has less functionality (unable to choose seats).",Irritating experience
1,2023-03-17 19:12:40,"This is a review for Ticketmaster as a company. They have completely lost sight of what their customers want. Going to concerts used to be something we could do as a society to collectively enjoy the arts but has turned into a vicious lottery system that only the mega wealthy can afford to participate in, or if you’re not mega wealthy-something you can only afford to do maybe once a year. Ticketmaster clearly has no care in the world for giving fans a chance at buying face-value tickets, they thrive off of the scalpers who use their service to make obnoxiously large profits while actual fans lose out on the opportunity to see artists perform. Sometimes artists who are nearing the end of their touring careers making it that much worse when the opportunity to see them is taken away. I’m hoping more artists will take their business elsewhere to smaller ticketing businesses like Dice FM that only allow tickets to be sold on their one platform and resold only for the original value. This generation of concert goers is dwindling due to the lack of accessibility to getting tickets. Thanks for nothing Ticketmaster.",has ruined the concert going experience

Monday I purchased tickets with insurance that wouldn’t store in my wallet. Okay np. I checked the app for confirmation; no record I bought tickets. Checked my bank account, funds immediately withdrawn. Emailed. No answer. Emailed insurance company who at least responded but still haven’t received any email acknowledging my purchase. 5 days later, still confirmation of purchased tickets. Still no response to my now 2nd email. Also, my tickets, my Exact Seats are still for sale?!?! So my money has been taken and the only proof provided are my screenshots and bank statement. Nice job. My fear is heading to the event with screenshots of tickets to be told it’s no go then Ticketmaster further declining to help because it’s past the event time to cancel. I should’ve sprung for the extra money to print or have the tickets mailed or maybe, just maybe a multi billion dollar company shouldn’t be shaking me down.

I understand Taylor swift is high demand but that is EXACTLY the reason they should have prepared better for this. I was a verified fan and cardholder but somehow didn’t get tickets for either.

1,2020-02-15 13:10:41,Last night Valentines Day at the Bocelli concert there was no seats nor even a row for the “floor” tickets I had purchased from Ticketmaster. I was sold 2 floor tickets by Ticketmaster and these were part of a wedding proposal. They included VIP lounge. When we arrived to the venue there was no Row 19 and we were told we would have to sit off the floor in a corner seat and that they could not guarantee we would sit together. This led to a very difficult situation and the romantic experience for the night was ruined. We never did get our seats. This is highly unethical and something must be done. Amalie Arena should also take some responsibility in this as they were to set the seating. We saw that duplicate seating had been set up for lower numbered rows and ours eliminated. The show was oversold at our expense. We expect compensation as this was obviously not a mistake. You charge more for floor tickets and this is the service you give your clients. It was certainly not the Valentines evening linked to proposal that I envisioned. It will be interesting to see if Ticketmaster provides a refund for this debacle?

I contact them again and am informed that the tickets would actually be mailed to me, expected within 10-14 business days. I wait 4 weeks and no tickets arrive. Contact them again and they tell me my tickets are actually printable not being mailed. I go to my account to print them and it says they are still being mailed.

I spent 40 minutes clicking all over the map and nothing was available. Looks like Ticket master was filtering out seats as people were buying and their system didn’t filter them out quick enough so they would show as available when they really weren’t. Their whole system went down for a few hours no one could buy anything. They also filtered out sound check that was supposed to be available to a certain presale. And failed to clarify the limits wether they applied only to the presales or to the whole concert. Also season ticket holders got a hold of the sound check tickets which they will try to resale for thousands of dollars. When fans truly just want to see the loves of their life.

Just say they aren’t available from the beginning and I think people will be less upset.

Why does it have to take three clicks to be able to see the actual price I’m paying? Especially when the fees vary for verified resale and standard tickets, as a consumer youre left guessing what the price is until you reach the third or fourth screen in the process. It just makes it really difficult to compare prices, and it makes it that much harder to understand what you’re really paying per ticket.

I was already signed in since the night before and checked and saw my name in my account. I had to make an inquiry into my account which brought up a webpage asking me to sign in, which i then did. After this I re-entered the app to try to purchase tickets and found I lost out on the seats I originally wanted. Only seats available were on the next mezzanine up. Selected some seats and look....Amex is now in the credit card drop down !!! I am so upset I want to smash my iPad into the wall !! Ridiculous to have to sign in twice, especially without any instruction to do so. Poorly constructed app, terrible service !",Lost good seats !!!
1,2022-11-15 21:29:25,"Basically, my cousin was buying Taylor Swift tickets for me, her, my brother, and her friend, and she did it from this platform. She got presale, and she reached to a point in which she was sixth in line to buy tickets, when it kicked her out. When she got back in line, and was about to buy tickets, she didn’t have the money on her and the stupid site kicked her out again, and by the time my dad convinced her dad to let her buy the tickets, there were no seats left when she was at the front. Apparently other people have been having this issue as well, so it seems as if Ticketmaster painfully underestimated its server capacity and how many people would show up. This happened to a PRESALE person, so Ticketmaster REALLY needed to be less stupid when giving out tickets. But sure, let the bots and the resellers get the best seats, but not my poor cousin, who spent her entire freaking (for the lack of a better word) school day on this stupid website? And yes, I downloaded this app just to review bomb it, is that a problem mods?",An experience my cousin had
5,2019-10-30 14:39:16,I tried multiple times to buy my tickets through the Ticketmaster website using my home computer but every time I got the “pardon the interruption - adding captcha” notice and it NEVER WENT AWAY.  I left my computer running for over an hour and it never loaded.  Why are your systems so inept?  For the service fees charged - your software system should be able to load the “captcha” software within seconds.  Such a huge hassle to your customers who are trying to purchase tickets.  I was only trying to purchase two tickets - not buying a large quantity for potential resale market.  Again - a huge hassle to deal with your website.  And - no customer service number to call and speak with a human about it.  The only number shown is if you have an existing order - which I don’t have because of the captcha message.,Captcha
5,2023-02-17 02:37:33,Been using Ticket Master for YEARS. Only thing I’m not happy with is how long it took me to finally write this review.   I had spent the rest of my check on a ticket like 5 years ago and ended up having an issue. The customer service was so fast in fixing my issue and expediting my funds back to my account or crediting my account so I could buy tickets to the show I was trying to see THAT night. I had to ask to be transferred a couple times but I was beyond impressed and satisfied with how they handled and fixed my issue!  The app is easy to navigate. It’s quick and easy to access tickets when you get to the venue. I only trust TM with my concert tickets because of how well they’ve treated me in the past. Very happy with them and don’t intend on changing anything.,Favorite site/app to use

Every time I would select tickets the system would tell me another fan got them and then the system would offer me different seats. If I selected buy, I got this endless blue circle and then a pardon us a system error occurred message. This same situation occurred the last 3 times I went to buy tickets. When I purchased Elton John tickets the system told me an error occurred and my seats were released when in fact I was charged for them.

I can’t buy Olivia Rodrigo tickets now. I have done absolutely everything for the past two days trying to reset my password so I could buy tickets since I have to use the “verified” email I signed up to get notified about Olivia Rodrigo tickets for. I NEVER received a reset email and I requested them over 20 times. I can’t find a way to contact Ticketmaster so that’s out of the question. I have done everything from making a new account with my business email and tried changing it to my personal which was what I signed up for the ticket updates with. I feel like it’s rigged. I have done everything I can for two days! I have never bought concert tickets in my life and the one time I tried Ticketmaster was my problem. Wish I could rate this zero stars.

Also I have concerns if my previously provided passwords are being stored somewhere (why remember my old ones?).    Furthermore, the website, app, service requires a phone number prior to purchasing tickets and I am definitely not comfortable providing out my phone number to another organization whom may sell/share my personal information with other “partners”  that may ultimately add to my spam/texts.  Lastly, what if I didn’t have a phone number, does that mean I’m barred from all TicketMaster events?

Now on the other hand, I feel as though you shouldn’t have to get approved of the buy now pay later option. If you have a debit card, credit card or a checking account with the correct amount of funds in the account to cover the cost of the buy now pay later option then there shouldn’t be a problem. That is one thing I think should be reviewed by corporate because you can loose a lot of customers by limiting this option.

No, my friends did want to get the app for a “transfer.” I told them I’d see if I could print the tickets. I searched the app, and the notes looked fairly straight forward. WRONG!!! I had to hunt for each button, then it took me to a page with no buttons. NO BACK, NO NEXT, NOTHING! I had to start all over. When I finally got to the page (after 3 attempts) with the tickets, there was no “print” button. I tried to find it, and guess what, I had to start all over again - hunting for the right buttons, 4th attempt! After 45 minutes or so, I found the tickets again. This time I took a screen shot of each ticket. One of the instructions on the ticket said you must present the entire page. I printed them and now I am hoping our friends are able to enter the theater with these tickets. In the future, I will go directly to the box office, if possible, not Ticketmaster.",Worst App ever!

I hope no boomer uses this app because they certainly will not understand the terms and conditions for which they’ve signed up for.

Once I picked my tickets a message appeared saying the device I was using (my iPhone) wasn’t supported and it booted me out and put me back into the queue. I was then told there was only 1 person ahead of me and I waited for almost 30 min. I used my iPhone to purchase tickets with no issue that time. I am disappointed that my seats aren’t that great. They would’ve been much better the first time around. Clearly since I used the same device both times it is a Ticketmaster error.

The app would not allow me to log on with the credentials that worked on the website saying the account cannot be found. When trying to contact customer support (our show was the same day), you have to go through multiple layers of unhelpful and generic FAQs and when you finally get to type in a message, you’ll still get an automated response with the same unhelpful FAQs pasted in the body of the reply.

I had them printed but printed tickets are not allowed. Fine. Whatever. But when you go to use the mobile tickets you HAVE to use the app. I just find it annoying that I have to now go and download an app that I don’t have storage for (i had to delete other apps just to make room for it) and then log in and get my tickets from there into my wallet and then show the venue attendant. It may be old school but I find it way easier, and I feel more secure, if I could just print them. Or at least show them on my phone without having to get the app. They basically are forcing you to get their app in hopes that you won’t delete it and continue to use it.

I know these funds aren’t going back to the performers or the venue. Actually cut dawn the amount of tickets I buy through ticket master because of this. This is coming from someone who goes to usually around 100 concerts a year. The fees that are tacked on are strangling the people that are already finding it hard to pay for the sky rocketing tickets. I understand that everyone need their cut but come on.  Ticketmaster has been around for a long time. The greedy nature at which they charge people extra fees is in need of a competitor to swoop in and start undercutting.

I then purchased other tickets, same price but seats not as good. I am very disappointed, apps are supposed to make things easier but It was just frustrating.

I’ve now had to create multiple accounts, and in order to redeem a “Ticketmaster” ticket on my phone, use Apple wallet or Google pay and NOT the Ticketmaster app or any of its services.

And it’s impossible to talk to a human about a more sensible option.

Not only can they not handle the sheer volume of ticket purchasers, but you would think after this amount of time as an online vendor that they would have enough bandwidth to update purchases in a timely manner.

But then as you click on what you think are available tickets, you are constantly given the response that you just missed the purchase and that someone else purchased them before you. Also, while you’re waiting for tickets to go on sale, you should be able to do the phone verification process then.

They refused to give me a refund saying, “All sales are final.” And then they had the audacity to suggest I buy more tickets from them.

It’s a very buggy app that fails to deliver a seamless customer service experience throughout the application.  Sometimes the application will perform as advertised and delivers a below average customer service experience.

While it is your decision to purchase the protection, the approach is high pressure and the information provided is not balanced.    The app also has significant advertising and presents special offers that are all tied to a “free trial period” that turns into a subscription.    The app, when used as a ticket, is reliable which results in a two star rating instead of a one star rating.    In summary, this is an app you’ll just have to have on your phone and when you use it, you’ll have a so-so experience when all things work.

1,2020-02-28 21:05:42,"I purchase tickets through the app and online several times a year.  This was by far the worst experience I have had to date.  The app crashed all day, I sat in the lobby for over an hour after arriving 10 minutes early just to be told to sign in again.  Which led to the website saying my password needed to be updated, which was just changed the night before.  I lost multiple seats because of the sign in issues and had to eventually purchase my 4th choice.  I was also not allowed to leave a single seat empty which makes no sense.  This is the most ridiculous experience I have had.  I will be choosing other ticket sites moving forward.  If your site and app can’t handle traffic for a single concert you should correct this.   Absolute Garbage.  I really hope someone takes the time to read this, but knowing your track record you probably don’t care.",The worst Ticketmaster experience to date
5,2018-10-29 18:23:57,"I’m ok with being charged for shipping and handling for tickets. But paying over $12 pr ticket when I print it at home is ridiculous. If anything, I should be reimbursed for printing at home. Ticketmaster charge their customers, in essence, $12 for nothing. Apart from lining their pockets. Ticketmaster don’t do anything. Ticketmaster don ‘t send you anything. Ticketmaster have no real product. But they charge you for it. What an amazing business to get into! Offer nothing, charge a lot. It’s the biggest scam in retail history. Leave the ticketing to the hardworking people directly involved with the events instead. Those that work for the theaters, stadiums, with the performers around the country - not these crooks.",Ridiculous fees
1,2019-04-01 01:09:20,I really don’t understand how the second tickets go on sale they already have the tickets for sale on Stub hub- Low Life scum is making money off cheating the true fans.   How can you claim you can’t stop it?  It’s easy if you turn around and sell your tickets the second after you buy them your order is cancelled.  If you are not a person with a ticket master account who uses there tickets should be a red flag.   I love going to concerts but how can I afford to pay thousands of dollars for a ticket that should of cost 175 so some scum bag can profit off of me.  It cheats the artist and the fans.  But Ticketmaster gets to double dip by recharging that ridiculous convenience fee which is why you guys probably don’t stop it.   I really hope the verified fan program starts to work because we are in desperate need of fixing this problem and StubHub and Ticketmaster marketplace don’t do anything that contribute to the problem.,Bots ruining it for everyone
1,2022-01-24 17:34:12,"I honestly have at least one issue whenever I use Ticketmaster. Sometimes I lose my spot in the que and it freezes. So I have to restart and join the que again losing my opportunity to get good tickets. I also had an issue with buying presale tickets saying I was approved then wasn’t able to buy them for whatever reason. Now my latest issue is I can’t get transferred tickets to my account for no reason whatsoever. Of course TM pawns the issue to the box office since they literally have no valuable customer support. But the problem is the box office is impossible to reach to speak to someone too. I also use up to date technology with good internet connections so the problem isn’t me, I don’t have any issues buying tickets through other means.

Signing-up, locating and purchasing the tickets, and adding them to my Wallet app was very simple and straightforward, and I felt very confident with everything.   But geez-o-petes this app is like an insecure, clingy ex-girlfriend.  No offense to ex-girlfriends, but Ticketmaster notified me by email or app almost daily, telling me that “the event is getting closer” and “have you got your tickets downloaded to your Wallet yet?”.  I’m sure there’s a way to limit notifications in the app settings, but I just swiped left and deleted just as quickly.

Im looking and looking but there’s no where to call them I keep searching and it looks like the don’t care if you get your tickets or not but it’s funny because when I was struggling to get them there was a number it seems like after you buy them they want to cut of all contacts with you and leave the ones that are not effective like reporting and stuff so don’t by from here just go to the real deal (the stadium site) cause they will have it there and you can contact them if you need to",THIS APP IS BAD

The system kicked me out of one purchase which then forced me to have to rejoin the stupid queue to get in to hopefully score a ticket. The map was glitchy, horrible to try and pick seats on. Overall, I’d say this was worse than stubhub, and they are the trash company of online concert tickets. Screw you ticketmaster!   I also followed every step to make sure I was in early to get better seats to take my mother to see Garth Brooks, my payment info was updated, did everything right, and still got stuck in an hour long wait just to be left with nosebleed seats, what an absolute waste of my time.",Horrible Queue

I tinker around and refresh both website and app for a half hour, double check profile etc. Nope. Tickets still not available in the Ticketmaster app. Terrible user experience and so very irritated right now by how non-intuitive and senseless this type of design is.

I closed out and went back even though the tickets had suddenly jumped in price to $100+ for nosebleeds and now it’s simply saying it can’t even go through with my request. No reason given.  But-of course-every time I chose the tickets that were most expensive, suddenly the app “magically” worked just fine-no other fans stealing from me and no weird error messages. I’m glad this wasn’t a band I was actually dying and ravenous to see, but that aside I still was frustrated.

So i settled for sat although i have a weekend long music fest i got tix to. I called customer service and the guy was so uninformed and rude - and he said theres no way they could compensate me, not even refunding my card $20 for the severe inconvenience. Every other company gives me something for that big of a mess up, and a huge bug in their app caused me to miss an evening of a music festival i already paid for.

Then we downloaded the app to get access to the mobile tickets, and we couldn’t even log in because “the data [was] missing.” There was no print at home option and we were worried we wouldn’t even be able to get in. Maybe because it was around 5, there was also no answer over the phone for ticket support. But my husband finally managed to send the original link for the tickets to my phone and it finally worked somehow.

I was all set to go to my concert until I got COVID, so, of course, as a decent citizen I did not attend the event. So I would not be out the money, I decided to try to resell my tickets on the website. The tickets sold and the email said I would receive my money earned from the sale within 7 days after the event. Well....3 months later, still nothing. If you call the customer service number it tells you the call center is not operating.

You can successfully get in to buy tickets only for it give you an error to try again later every time you try to add tickets to your cart; eventually it will crash and kick you out/send you to the back of the queue regardless.   At best the Ticketmaster platform offers a dismal purchase success rate of 50%.

Too bad - bot farms will swoop in and grab the tickets you want at fair market prices only to provide “verified resale” at exorbitant prices and fees…  I will happily support small local venues to see artists for a fair market price - but the racket TM/LN and others have going is a scam and has been for years (only now made abundantly evident after Taylor Swifts recent tour ticket debacle made clear to all). I can’t support any of these major industry players for being complicit it helping to usher in an era of scandalously high prices, fees and lack of competition for live events.

1,2023-08-29 00:15:31,"There are so many problems with this app that is hard to figure out where to begin.   I will start off with the most recent thing that bugged me was my inability to get the tickets I purchased. I recently purchased season tickets, and thought I would begin to download them so I did not have to worry about it on game day. I go into the app and login and there is nothing. I find the receipt and log on to Ticketmaster via my laptop and go to manage my tickets and they exist. The only way for me to access such tickets is through the website anyhow so what is the point of the app if I can’t access my tickets.  Next you have the queue for when you are trying to purchase tickets that gives no indication of progress. I have gone into multiple ticket lines and get the whole way to checking out and then at the end they tell me the ticket is unavailable. I don’t understand why it says it is holding your seat when it can just get taken at checkout.  This is by far one of the worst services I have used to purchase tickets and manage them. Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be any competition so they can just leave their service in an inconvenient and sometimes unusable state.",Probably one of the worst services I have used
1,2018-07-23 03:49:24,I would just like to state how unsatisfied I am with the quality of your app. I’m out double the price of a ticket because your app can’t register whether or not I had scanned my ticket. Me and a few of my friends a couple weeks prior had bought a 4 pack of tickets but our plans had changed and I ended up coming in with my girlfriend (a separate time of entry as them) so a week before I had them send me my ticket through your app which we had purchased the tickets through (this means of sending was easily promoted and shown as an option) and when I arrived to the concert I was turned away as my ticket was already supposedly claimed despite me never entering the concert. If it weren’t for me having my debit card I’d have been out the whole night and either way I’m out an extra $45 because your app could not function properly. Very dissatisfied.,Now I’m out price the cost of a ticket
1,2022-04-17 17:57:52,"I am unbelievablely frustrated with this app. In the past you could either print out a ticket, or have the ticket delivered to your Apple Wallet, the same way flights work. Instead, Ticketmaster made this idiotic app that makes you create an account, download the app, log in, and then and only then can you even see the ticket. This is as troublesome and painful as it is, but the problem is that by doing not this way, the app absolutely cannot fail. Well, that’s exactly what happened. Tried to go to a White Sox game and could not log into the account because Ticketmaster overengineered this app with reCAPTCHA, something went down on the backend, and now no one at the stadium can log in. Absolute disaster on Easter weekend. I am so frustrated with this company and will never buy through Ticketmaster again because of the massive software problems of this app.",Do not use
5,2023-01-09 03:24:02,Ticketmaster helps with a lot. for me and everyone else that uses it. Today I bought 2 Ed sheeran tickets at Levi stadium. And they where 196$!!! Cheap. Ticketmaster has many events and it tells you if there is a event near you. And you can read information about that event. There is a lot of artists and football games you can see. For example I bought Taylor swift tickets and I actually got a vip package from a person who was selling tickets for 456$. Not to bad for a Taylor swift vip package. So Ticketmaster is a great app and is great for beginners. But does need some fixes. But besides that it’s just amazing. So yeah Ticketmaster is a amazing app.,Ticketmaster is the best!

When I finally got in to buy tickets they were either sold out (the floor and sound check tickets) or there were only nosebleeds available. How is this honoring your past customers who had sound check or barricade tickets for a canceled show? It’s a rip off, and I don’t like Ticketmaster for this. If there a competition company I’d use them. My advice is to be careful. Also, beware of scalpers who were given access to a secret VIP sale who are now turning around and charging people 4 times the TM price.

Since the show is in a week, I was afraid to select the standard mail option, which meant I had to pay an additional 20 bucks.

Ticketmaster provides a valuable service but doesn’t deserve the monopoly it has and should be shut down. I can’t get updates on when my tickets will be mailed and each page/correspondence says different information.

Fortunately I checked email and saw the confirmation email.  If I hadn't checked my email I would have gone through the process again and double ordered tickets. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me.   I'd like to think it's a bug in the ticketmaster site/app but happening twice makes me suspicious.  Additionally, I always have tickets sent via regular mail rather than wait till the day before show to print online.    Now I won't have that option.

I get it, it’s covid/post? Covid (no one to answer phones etc) but still, this last experience was definitely a problem. Disappointing. But I’m giving 4 stars because for the most part the app is pretty convenient and user friendly. Just.. too bad no one reached out to me with the several problems I had.. 😕",Mostly great
4,2022-07-16 05:04:42,I never had a bad experience with Ticketmaster. I’ve learned a valuable lesson last year when I used a different ticket site which I will never use again. It was last Halloween and Browns and Steelers were playing. I brought my tickets months earlier and I been looking forward to this game. I live in Atlanta so I drove to Cleveland only to find out there was not ticket for me. I so hurt and disappointed and I use that same for the next game the following Sunday. My  family brought me a ticket though Ticketmaster no issues and I have use Ticketmaster ever since. For now on I use only Ticketmaster for all my events thank you for your great service.,Happy customer
1,2023-09-29 10:27:49,I have purchased tickets before from Ticketmaster however this time I am stressed out because I purchased 4 baseball tickets on Ticketmaster for my birthday and spent about $230 and I am getting the run around about where my tickets are. I cannot access them and no one seems to give me a straight answer as to where they are. They sent me an email that I need to download MLB ballpark to access my tickets however nothing ever comes up showing I have tickets so I called customer service on both MLB ballpark and Ticketmaster and I’m still getting the run around. Save yourself the money and headache and purchase tickets from a trusted source because they are not trustworthy and now I feel I’ve just been scammed for $230 so now I need to get ahold of my credit card services to let them. What a happy birthday I’m getting 🤦🏻‍♀️,DO NOT ORDER ON TICKETMASTER

Download the app, go to my tickets and select “add to apple wallet” and what do you know - error message that I can’t add them to my apple wallet at this time. Tried force closing, reinstalling the app, still unable to add. Says to try again later. Have tried again later. And later. Now it’s the day of the show and still unable to add. Of course I can still access the tickets no problem from within the app.   Could just be a coincidence but it feels intentional, as though they’re essentially forcing me to keep the app on my phone until after the show. Will be immediately uninstalling after. So annoying.",Ticketmaster is a joke
1,2018-05-18 14:59:58,"Ok, where to start. I signed up for email/text reminders of when tickets went on sale. I knew when they went on sale but signed up anyway. My transaction was “ended” for no apparent reason, my time was not even close to expiring.  Then after retrying same precedure, it kept saying there was an error and not allowing to purchase tickets.  I tried on a different computer, same results. I then tried the phone ordering process. Live sales people lines were completely busy so I tried the automated line. Wow, totally useless.  Tickets went on sale at 10am. At 10:51, I get my text/email reminder, 51 minutes late. I then tried to buy tickets through the “reminder”. Another failure.  I tried one last time through the app and it worked.

5,2020-03-14 23:19:07,Really good app! I find it easier to use than seat geek really simple and gets to the point and it’s just easy! I see a lot of mixed reviews on this but on my opinion I have had no problems! I think the reason people would find problems with this is when a concert/event the day that the tickets are releasing it can get a bit complicated especially if it’s a very popular event many people are trying to get tickets and it can get complicated but I’ve never experienced that! But I would understand the stress. I will continue to use ticket master  to get my tickets! And I am excited to go to my 3rd concert using Ticketmaster!,5 stars! :)

The first time I tried to purchase resale tickets the transaction timed out. I then tried four more times, and the website kept telling me that I didn’t take my card. I went to check my credit card, and Ticketmaster had maxed out my credit card with the transactions but never gave me tickets. I called Ticketmaster several times to understand where my tickets were and they claimed the card was never approved - the bank showed all 4 transactions as approved on their side. The bank voided the transactions, but I when I went back later that night to try again, the tickets are now double what I tried to pay for earlier that day. It took two tries today to buy a pair of non-resell tickets; not to mention my bank assuming the charges were fraud. I am more than upset!!!",Terrible

5,2022-02-19 15:07:45,"I bought these tickets for my son it was an easy experience. The reason I bought these tickets is a story my son just told me. He has a cat that he named bright eyes and I assumed he named it after the Bonnie Tyler song Total Eclipse of the Heart. I guess he didn’t, he wasn’t even aware of her song, makes me feel old. Anyway, he informed me that he named bright eyes after your band because your song Lua. It definitely speaks to him. I am buying tickets for Nick for his 19th birthday which is March 2.

Honestly, I believe most people would rather see the higher price (including the fees) on the initial listing.  No matter how many people you think you’re attracting by listing a low price, you are turning off infinitely more people by hammering them with 75%-100% of the ticket cost in fees at checkout.  As consumers, we really don’t care about the split between all the people being paid from the ticket purchase (band, venue, promoter etc.).  You’d think the operators of the ticket site would know that showing $20 in fees on a $30 ticket only leads to the thousands of negative comments currently on the internet.  Just list the ticket for $50, or maybe $47 plus tax . That would seem to be PR 101.",Processing fees

The entire Ticketmaster experience needs to be put into the shredder, soaked in acid, and sunk to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. This company is so inept and out of its depth, the only way it can possibly still be in business is the fact that it’s the closest example to a monopoly we have in modern times. When it ever had a presale and ticket buying experience that was actually efficient and fair and God forbid actually enjoyable… of course they do away with it soon after because what profit can be made from resellers if *actual fans* get most of the tickets in the first go round?

I’ve been using Ticketmaster for years and am hardly ever successful in finding a ticket to big event. I’m always prompt at being logged in at 10AM on the day the tickets are released, but they are always sold out. All of the big events sell out within seconds and the app is slow (not that the website does much better). By the time it is done searching the events are sold out. But, ironically, before the sale starts the tickets are already on sale through third party sites at 2 to 3 Times the original price (if not more).

It literally says “no refund” and also I think this ticket website is way better than the others I never had problems with it also they’re a lot cheaper like I went on one web site the other day it look for some tickets and it was $45+ per person and when I looked on here it was $15-39 which is heck of a deal I mean one thing I don’t like about it is the tax but I say it would be like that anywhere u go but u would have to pay even more if so….,Good

I contacted live support, and he said I can’t get my refund at all because it’s “postponed” despite their Instagram saying the tour will not go on.

I received an email saying that due to high quantity of refund requests due to bands cancelling, that customer support is shut down, and that I essentially can’t get my refund.  I’ve been trying for weeks, and refunds aren’t hard.  Shady company, and you are screwed if your group cancels shows because they are going to take your money.

After digging for a number to call…I found three which didn’t connect to anything or anybody. When I tried to text the support bot, it was little to no help at all.

1,2018-02-24 16:49:27,If I could I would give a zero rating. Ticketmaster overall needs to figure out how to let the general public be able to purchase tickets!!!!  I spent all day on the site trying to purchase four tickets. Only to be timed out again and again. And then to find the tickets went to verified resale only. The tickets went from $36 through Ticketmaster and then to $95 verified resale. I can only assume that this means other ticket organizations are purchasing up huge amount of tickets at a time only to increase the value and resell. Ticketmaster please figure out a way for the general public to be able to buy tickets. Is it in your algorithm on your site that the more tickets you have in your cart the quicker you are able to check out/buy them? One has to wonder.,ZERO Rating!!!!

Once I went to see the induction ceremony to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and saw 2 seats at what looked like a good Price compared to others so I bought em.  When we got there we found that one of the seats was behind a giant spot light apparatus that prevented the viewer from seeing the stage such that one would have to stand up in order to see.  Since the folks behind us would not have appreciated that, said seat became one for viewing via overhead video screen only pretty much.

They give you the opportunity to purchase tickets from a reseller, but then in the uncontrollable event that your show gets cancelled they take 3 MONTHS to respond to you properly. Their phone line is “overwhelmed” as the automated message tells you. When they finally do respond they say they can’t issue a refund because they gave it to the original seller which makes absolutely no sense. How would the original purchaser get his refund for his purchase AND mine. Essentially they are saying that he over doubled his money off those tickets?

Everyone who was about to buy tickets to the Jojo siwa concert and got booted should have at least been contacted. Let’s see how much you stand by your brand.

Very vague. Here I am a week later the day of event and still “in progress”. I used their customer support and an agent never answered me. I called the number and only got a busy signal. No way to contact them. I reached out to the Mets themselves and in their system there was no record of the seats I had purchased being purchased. Had to purchase them again through the Mets.

They ensure that screenshots and printing out the ticket does NOT work at the event. This is an extremely ableist policy and makes me never want to purchase from them again.

2,2022-04-26 16:17:15,The app is fine and accomplishes the bare minimum it’s meant to achieve. Ticketmaster however has made the decision to use notifications to sell tickets. They will send occasional alerts about events they deem you will want to attend. There is no way to opt out of this specific type of marketing but the app does contain a toggle for notifications in the account tab. Unfortunately the app continues sending marketing notifications even with this toggle disabled. They simply do not honor the toggle. Therefore the only solution is to disable notifications for the app in your system settings. It is an ugly business practice to abuse notifications for marketing.,Does not honor notification toggle

Look at StubHub. Get a sense for how many tickets are left and the going rate. 2.  GO TO TICKETMASTER.  Sometimes the ticket brokers get ahead of themselves.  Are the same sections and rows available on Ticketmaster?  If yes, go with better price. 3. If you are not sure where the seats are, start the purchase process and before you pay, the seat number will be displayed.  If you are OK with those seats, buy the tickets.  Otherwise, search again and select a different offer. 4. Never feel rushed.  Take your time.  I got got an aisle seat, 2nd row, to Led Zepplin cover band Get The Led Out!  Show is later this week.

Those of us who purchase seats early now have no way of picking center of row and I bet the earliest folks (who paid less) will be placed far off to the sides of the venue.

Surely the same fee per ticket could be charged no matter what the price of the ticket is. Ticketmaster doesn’t do anything more for a $100 ticket or a $400 ticket.

1,2021-09-06 15:57:31,I buy 2 tickets to the Greek from Ticketmaster. I now have a need to sell them. Ticketmaster won’t let me sell them as a pair because the seats are not sequential. They are seats 31 and 33 and I bought them as a pair because the Greek has odd numbers seating in 1 side and even on another.   The Ticketmaster app is making me list them as individual seats and not a pair. I call customer service and can’t get through. I email them and get a canned reply a week later to check their FAQ’s which doesn’t address this issue. Now I am stuck with Tickets I can’t sell.   Stay away from Ticketmaster.

So I go to the website in my phone and I’m able to get in. So I then go on my computer because it’s easier for me to navigate and it STILL  says all sold out!  Don’t understand that!  So I try iPad and phone and had difficulty trying to pick a seat. I didn’t want to be assigned a seat and the interactive map show rows that were near the row but not the one I wanted and I could see there was a seats available right next to us!  Very frustrating!  I hen went on the app. Same thing.  But I was finally able to get the right row and seat and purchased my ticket!  Just relieved I could get it right next to us!

Seconds later I was informed that someone had beaten me to them and they weren’t available. Long story short, that happened to me at least 15 more times before there were no more seats left.

So after getting back in the second time my tickets kept getting bought by others until it kicked me out again.

In light of the COVID-19 situation Ticketmaster has deemed it has a right to deny refunds (cancelled NHL events in particular).  I have first hand knowledge of this and have attempted to have a situation escalated with management. We can’t accept a duopoly where consumers have no rights for refunds.  Live Nation and Ticketmaster should never have been allowed to merge as the reduction in competition has hurt consumers.

I use a password keeper, so I know the “incorrect password” thing is just Ticketmaster silently expiring my password. Which is fine for security, but you need to say something instead of blaming the user for forgetting. All of the marketing email boxes are default opt-out instead of opt-in, which means very little respect for the user’s inbox. The credit card entry screen resets every time you swipe away, which makes it impossible to copy/paste fields from a password keeper. Tons of random timeouts, which should be embarrassing in the age of unlimited cloud computing resources. Super confusing error screen that looks like it came from a web page in built in 2005.

I waited and tried buying tickets for face value but by the time I got tickets to the checkout screen I was charged a lot more… oh and btw during the presale you could and still can go to StubHub and get tickets. I’m excited to see this special event but I hope someone finally hits LicketMaster where they have been killing the true fans for years right in the balls…,Willie Nelson 90th birthday party
1,2022-11-20 22:25:26,Ticketmaster you should be ashamed of the way you do business. My daughter wasted 4 hours and missed classes as a so called “verified fan” only to see no tickets available. Cap One day had tickets in my cart Card was charged no ticket confirmation. Called and was told nope no tickets charge will drop off. Nope charge went through still no tickets. Called back and oh wait they just didn’t sync to your account but we can refund those if you’d like Uh no I want my tickets so you can’t resell them. BTW still no tickets showing up.,Absolutely the worst

Finally, to add insult to injury, after swallowing hard and purchasing your tickets, Ticketmaster tries to intimidate you into purchasing insurance on top of the tickets, making customers answer yes or no (with those intimidating comments) to purchasing insurance, not just an option one could add if desired.  Furthermore, the app does not provide the ability to easily switch from one credit card to another. One must delete one card (with more warnings) to add another.

1,2022-04-25 19:28:13,An absolute dumpster fire. Enabling scalpers and creating a breeding ground for scams. Ticketmaster is amazing at sucking the life out of concerts and ensuring that the only people that can attend concerts are the wealthy. Reselling your tickets for money should be illegal and even if it’s not… doesn’t mean it’s okay or ethical. Also: the dynamic or increased pricing is utter garbage. Imagine supporting an app that say it’s raising of ticket prices is because they want to “ensure the most loyal fans can attend”— you mean the richest.

Because that is wrong on so many facets, I shall go back to avoiding anything to do with Ticketmaster. I’ll try other venues or just disappoint people about tickets. Money is better spent on worthwhile ventures.",Disappointed

I’m beyond angry and disappointed.  I wish I had known this app wouldnt work.  Now my daughter has to pay for it with a broken heart.  I feel like I failed her.  Thank you so much!!,Horrible App!!!

Don’t sell your tickets on Ticketmaster because they don’t pay you until after the event and if it gets cancelled they refund your buyer and not you. So you take all the risk without getting paid. Customer service is a joke. Better off buying scalped tickets at the event because scalpers take less of a fee than these scam artists.,So stupid

1,2017-12-14 00:35:22,Not easy to remove seats from the list.  My main issue is that Ticketmaster uses its monopoly to charge unconscionable fees.  Why have they not been investigated?  No other channel gets away with charging these fees.  $77 ticket and $19 fees.  Total ripoff but no other option.  Seattle Theatre Group has betrayed its attendees by partnering with Ticketmaster.
