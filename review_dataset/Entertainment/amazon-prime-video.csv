Plus, sometimes, no, often when I’ve been watching a series I go back and can’t find it when you would think it would be more like Netflix, sitting there in plain site waiting for you to watch it again, but, NO, you have to remember what it was called and go to search and find it that way. And some of the British shows are just difficult to remember the names of because they aren’t names of shows we are used to hearing about in the US. Overall, I love Prime and it’s originals, but this app needs help! Please people, see if you can do what Netflix does-it’s not that hard!",Less than user-friendly app.

GOOD: Seems downloads are a LOT faster now - not Netflix fast, but much improved - Thanks! Great Selection of old and new programs. Always liked the selection - especially old movies and series. I like the new better search of ""view with ads."" BAD: Untested new features, or I am just not someone they target as a user. Buttons do not always start or stop play but randomly jumps to another page for some reason. Downloads fail, go away, or just don't seem to work, then do - horrible download progress communication. ""My list"" is now harder to access, use, less information, and even harder to clean up. I can no longer easily differentiate the ""My List"" freevee and pay programs without looking at each program individually - I used frevee when I have wifi, but cant find them now on ""My List"". Competitor Netflix's downloads is no longer vastly superior, but now Netflix is way easier to use. Again, the things I liked in Prime are just going away or gone, and the new features don't help or hurt the experience for me, so their target audience is not me.",Great selection. Faster Downloads. Still clumsy.
2,2023-03-09 09:36:23,"As another commenter noted a couple of days ago, AirPlay has stopped working properly since last update. Overall this is the app I use most to watch TV/movies because of preferring the interface and really enjoying the X-ray feature of trivia and cast info when available. However, overnight, I stopped being able to stream my audio through to my wifi external speakers via AirPlay. Or rather, i can do so but without seeing the video. I am able to through my one speaker using it in Bluetooth mode but otherwise i get a black screen and sound. Or I can watch the video with just the regular iPad sound, but I prefer the better and louder quality of my Sonos system and I often stream it through my house as I’m moving room to room. Oddly, I can have the full AirPlay sound AND video if I minimize the video to use screen-in-screen but it won’t go back to the full screen with audio AND video when I remaximize it. PLEASE FIX ASAP. This is beyond frustrating and I was about to factory reset my iPad because I thought my machine was the problem until I played with every other app repeatedly and then saw that other review describing the same problem.",AirPlay issues
2,2022-08-23 04:29:09,"The barrage of ads is not only unnecessary, but they are also at a greater volume point that the actual entertainment that I wish to watch.  It’s extremely difficult to endure as well as the option NOT to skip the ads.  The greatest disgust is that you will sync to play not one but two ads as well, depending on the chosen feature.    Your greatest inadequacy is your lack of formatting the Prime app to the Prime screen on my chosen device.   I will choose a certain show/movie to watch from the app and proceed to my form of viewing.  I will wait a few minutes before I switch on my TV before I settle in to watch, 5-10 minutes.  My recent selection is not shown in my chosen features to watch, even after a decent amount of time.  Which leads me to search for my title.  The formats must be consistent!!  I have actually become so bothered by not only the ads but the lack of cohesive formats!!!  Please, format both to sync and allow viewers to skip your ads as more than one will play at a time.  Both issues an easy to adjust.  Please make an effort to do so.  It’s quite frustrating and has decreased my viewership.",Quite upsetting…..
1,2022-12-10 23:32:26,"Purchased a lot of movies. The app still recognizes the purchase but My Stuff/Purchases will only display 20 titles. Resorting from recent to A-Z or Z-A will display a different set but again limited to 20.  Whoever thought that limiting purchase display list to 20 instead of being able to scroll though all purchases should be fired for incompetence.   Tried to report but it sends you to a chat feature. After being bounced to several people, I got the standard uninstall and reinstall the app and restart ipad. Neither worked.  Tried to report again and once more bounced to several different people in chat. They seem to be unwilling to report as a new bug when they fail to solve the issue.  Their work around is to go to web address to access purchased movies/shows given My Stuff/purchases is broken. Alternative if you remember every purchase you can use search feature to find it and finally have the option to play.  No more purchases until they get this fixed. The work arounds are annoying and take more time when it worked before the update.  F on the last update and D- on chat experience.",9.24 added bugs!
3,2023-03-22 19:31:17,"Several issues with the ads I’m watching a Freevee program currently so I don’t know if these issues exist specifically with Freevee content, but it is so problematic that I felt I had to write a review.   1. Not displaying the length of the total ad time during every ad break; they are sporadic. Prime used to be very good about this, idk what happened.   2. Not allowing me to use picture-in-picture when the ad is playing, forcing me to stay on screen while the ad is playing, or closing out the program all together if I don’t go back to the app to let the ad play after a period of time.   3. Clunky transition into an ad, right between words, or in the middle of an important revelation. Usually ads happen at the end of sentences or during a scene change but these ads are intrusive, and severely affect the viewing experience. (In the past I believe there used to be a timer that told you that the ad was incoming and would gracefully transition into an ad but slowly bringing down the sound and a fade to black to allows the ad to come in, and go out. That was amazing. If it wasn’t this service, please implement that!)  4. If I go BACK to hear or see something again, it triggers an ad, regardless of if I use the 15 sec playback button, or if I scrub the content. It doesn’t even have to be where an ad is shown to be, it will just trigger an ad, and then force you to watch another ad if there’s one lined up, even if it’s only 10-15 secs away.",The Ad configuration needs work
1,2023-06-26 01:51:37,"Purchased Discovery+ subscription on my Prime Video account mainly for Expedition Unknown and am now being charged to stream it or can’t find the included version. Finding the shows the are included in my subscription or currently watched are too hard to find, however the same shows for purchase comes up first even when they are included in my subscription. This is a rip off. Why should the app charge you for shows that are included in your subscription? Why pay for the channel and this (plus others) that are included just to purchase what’s supposed to be included? Maybe this is a change but it’s too much work to look for what I’m already paying for. Also huge con that they don’t offer Peacock but I’m sure if I purchased their channel, it would be the same thing. Considering canceling as other streaming options can bundle more channels for a better price by the time you add all the subscriptions and don’t even get what’s offered without paying additional on top of the channel. Not worth it with other streaming options for me.",Rip Off- charges for shows on channels you purchase
4,2023-06-12 16:41:40,"This app is great:) There are so many included shows and i’ve had a really great time watching them. I’ve been watching Good Omens (excited for s2) and the legend of vox machina. however my only grievance is that the subtitles are a nightmare. You should have a setting to automatically keep them on. I’m not deaf or hard of hearing or anything however having the subtitles on really helps me understand what’s going on. It is really annoying to have to turn on the subtitles every-time i leave the app, or whenever a new episode starts (sometimes it works most of the time they turn off) I would really appreciate if there was just a setting to have the subtitles stay in for everything they’re available for. other than that the originals are great and the video quality is as-well, if you are also someone who relies on subtitles keep in mind that they can be very annoying at times.",subtitles are very finicky
1,2022-12-15 06:37:01,"Like, I’d get it if it was a smaller or a free service. Honestly, it’d be fine. But having to wait for something to load then I can click skip so I can then wait for the show I wanted to watch to load after? And even worse, the app crashes a lot when I hit skip, or just kick me to the Home Screen of the app. And maybe it wouldn’t bother me as much if you didn’t constantly push paid-for content and makes it more difficult than it should to filter the shows included with subscription. While The Grand Tour and The Tick are easily some of the best shows here, the latter is a HUGE example of missed opportunity through the lack of pushing. Even buying and watching super hero and comedy shows before finding The Tick myself, it never once showed up in suggestions. And that’s one of YOUR shows that I couldn’t find until a YouTuber mentioned it existed, off hand, in a video about something else entirely.  So many missed opportunity and problems within the app, and the ads are just the Cherry on top that made me wanna rant about my gripes with the service.",One word: ads on content
4,2022-12-10 21:48:04,"I love to watch paranormal shows and Prime has a lot of options…” A Haunting “ is a great example of the shows I watch.  I have no adds on my service, so idk if this is the problem when watching this show.  This is a very edge of your seat program,  the problem is, when it come toward the very end of every episode, Prime ends the program immediately after what would be the last commercial break, so I never get to see what happens at the very end.  UGH!! THIS IS SO FRIGIN FRUSTRATING!!!  It’s an awesome show and the end of it, I’m sure, would be incredible and not to mention the nformative. But I will never know what happens to the demons/spirits/residents or mediums/priests/paranormal investigators because PRIME DOES NOT SHOW THE END OF ANY OF THEIR EPISODES!!!!!

3,2020-03-03 00:55:26,"First, you can get a 5 star rating to see how others are feeling about the movie you are considering.  You will see right away the year it was made and who is in the cast. Second and my favorite, You can click onto the the cast and get individual pictures of each cast member and feedback on their film history.  How many times have you watched a movie and wanted to know who played that character?  Prime has made it easy for you to find out the name of that character you didn't know before. Third, lists other movies that people watched that had watched this movie.  Often leading to another movie that was just as good. Fourth and fantastic, I can type in favorite actors, favorite directors, specific countries, to get lists of movies I would like to watch for whatever category reasons I want.  Fabulous for anyone who wants to do film studies.  You can type in about any subject and find movies that will fall into the category you want to focus on.   No other video provider offers as many choices in movies, TV, documentaries, series, and anything else you can think of.  They have made a point to cover just about everything a home entertainment app audience tastes and needs could possibly want to find.

4,2020-01-15 23:25:10,"I love the prime video app overall. For the most part it remembers where you left off on shows from device to device. I can save my favorites, and it recommends shows for me.  The first flaw that bugs me, if I pause the movie with around 5 minutes left, and come back to it after the screen shuts off, it always skips to the next episode and cuts off my last few minutes. This happens on my Galaxy, Firestick and iPad, so I know it’s not my device . Drives me crazy.  Next flaw is I can’t clear my watch history on just one show. I’m rewatching some shows and lose my place because it shows that I’ve seen all the episodes. I don’t want to clear my entire watch history, then I’ll lose my place in current shows. I wish this was a feature. If this feature exists, I haven’t seen anywhere to click to make this happen. Other than these two complaints, I enjoy prime video very much!","Good, but flawed"

Good enough of selection of movies, never enough. Like to see more foreign films and independent films.   Also would like to see them get rid of the ludicrous restriction of the prohibition against watching videos outside the country. Why do they care if I watch it in Utah or if I watch it in Japan? I have paid to watch the film. They certainly should be able to work around this legal technicality which is absurd! That’s when I want to watch my movies the most, when I’m outside the country.   Also I think they charge for way too many series and films when I am a Prime member. They vast majority should be  free.",Good enough but not great!
3,2019-04-11 11:45:10,"i thoroughly enjoy the selection of tv shows and movies prime video brings. add ons, especially the HBO add on just heightens my experience. despite this, the developers have plenty of work to do with the app itself. it works just fine on the tv but the app is another story. often when i start a new episode the pause screen remains while the video continues to play in the background. i try to tap to make it go away and nothing happens. i try to tap anywhere to make it do anything like press back to return the home page or press pause and nothing works. i even exit the app and close the tab and the audio continues to play in the background. even turning off my phone it continues to play for several moments after. at first i thought it was just my ipad since it was an older model and has a history of issues but i continuously had the same issues on my iphone. not the end of the world but certainly annoying",good selection but poor app experience
1,2021-11-24 02:47:05,"This app is super deceiving. It shows all the movies and tv shows that you could get by purchasing the prime package. After some digging, that initial purchase does not include all of the movies and tv shows that pop up on the app… you have to make ADDITIONAL purchases to get basically any movie or tv show that is worth watching, to add these additional streaming services/ ‘channels’ it’s about 10$ a month added on to the 12$ you already spend a month on the app itself…. So in a nutshell, it shows you all these popular movies that people watch and love and these super highly rated movies, but you can’t watch them with your initial purchase, you have to buy another ‘package’ like paramount, Starz, showtime, etc. I understand they are trying to make it ‘more convenient’ so you can stream all your favorites in one app but it’s deceiving and honestly is a total waste of money. Way too expensive when each additional channel is about 10$. Just my opinion though.",Deceiving and an absolute waste of money.

I don't appreciate the options (some movies you still have to buy or rent to enjoy) like 'The Grinch' among others for now. They have others available...that came out in 1920s but not the newer ones available! It has been frustrating that I have to watch on my phone for most of the features and am absolutely not able to watch anything on my laptop.

2,2023-08-16 19:50:21,"It’s amazing to me how the last few updates have transformed this from being a really solid five star app to deserving less than one star. I gave it two out of loyalty.   In the past, you could see the upcoming episodes under the one you were watching, like every other video streaming app. They changed that.  In the past, the auto rotate kicked in at a much more intuitive point. They made that a lot worse as well, replacing it with a button.  In the past, when you were watching a series, the app saved your progress, but now it only does so every so often.   In the past, if you were watching an episode of a series and closed the app, when you re-opened that episode, it would start back up where you left off. Now it starts from the beginning.   Many basic functions any video streaming app should have have been kneecap or removed in recent months.   Honestly, it’s like a concerted effort to try to destroy the app. It was one of the best video streaming apps before, but now has become as enjoyable to use as scooping out your own eyeballs with a scalding nail.   I don’t know if this is something that the developers are doing to look busy and save their jobs but please stop. Sitting on their hands and doing nothing would’ve been much more preferable.

If you stop a show with less than five minutes left and then come back, it’s gone on to the next episode automatically even though you didn’t finish the last one. Lastly, the subtitles randomly freak out and will just flash on the screen for a split second and disappear for huge segments of the show.

I waited two hours and still was not fixed called again and was told a different reason so I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor said it was the system it can take 24-72 hours to correct. I was upset because I had bought the season and just wanted to watch the episode but understand. She said for the inconvenience she would refund me my prime membership and we ended the call. She calls me back remind you she is a SUPERVISOR and tells my I’m sorry I cancelled the membership instead of refunding it… like no I didn’t want it cancelled I don’t have 16$ to just spend right now when I already budgeted and paid for this month and your refund takes 3-5 days.

However, what really annoys me is the fact that they limit the amount of devices that you can watch shows/movies on but then it takes forever to update when switching devices. I can’t count how many times I’ve tried switching from my phone to my tv for it to take over fifteen minutes for it to allow me to watch on the different device. No matter how many times I exit out of the app or turn off the device it continuously tells me that my video cannot play because it is “playing on another device.” If they are going to be that particular about how many devices can be used they should update their software so it runs faster.

It’s nice that you can make different profiles so your shows aren’t mixed in with a family member’s shows or vice versa. They have a lot of kids show options as well which is great. The only thing I noticed about the app that was a negative, would be that sometimes after I’ve watched a show, it won’t show up in the “recently viewed” list and I have to search for it which is kind of a pain.

Also I can’t make it a background window on my phone without full screening it first which is another thing other media apps do right away which is odd.

I thought the point of downloading a show or movie was so you could watch it while offline. Is there some new law requiring an internet connection to watch a download because it makes no sense otherwise. I pray you fix these issues ASAP.",Why do I need an internet connection watch a download
2,2018-06-12 23:39:58,"I know that you guys just love to introduce Prime content, that's pretty much useless abroad. But removing My Library, you know, movies that I bought and that I own, seems to me like adding a new bug, not fixing anything tbh. Just creating chaos out of the completely fine app. Maybe by intention. ============================== After contacting customer support turned out that since I'm abroad, the app just told to Prime that my country isn't the US anymore. That switched country and bought movies disappeared. Huuuuuuuge bug. Bought movies are just like original DVDs or Blue-rays, played on let's say US Blueray player. They must be playable everywhere. And please don't make automatic software decisions before asking user is that really what user wants. Those are mobile devices that we're talking about, meaning they're moving, sometimes across the world, not only across the US. Something to think about Amazon's PMs.",Where's my library?!?
2,2017-12-16 19:51:45,So the app is pretty good when it works and it’s worked mostly well for the couple of years I’ve been a prime member. I like that if you tap the screen while watching something you can learn more about the actors or general trivia about the scene. It’s also nice that I could easily pick up where I left off. For a long time the last thing I watched would appear at the top.  But I noticed lately that I sometimes have to search the title of what I was in the middle of watching if I stopped midway. It’s especially frustrating if I’m tired and the title doesn’t come to mind right away.   The most frustrating problem I’ve had lately is videos not playing at all. I get an error message saying it can’t connect to the Internet. But I have no problems streaming videos or music in other apps or browser.

2,2019-01-05 10:44:07,"The features of the app that I have checked out, so far, are pretty slick; however, when you run across an important feature that falls flat and simply doesn’t work, it is quite frustrating. It is obvious that the “contact the seller” link that is provided in the order status section wasn’t tested (incompetence), or the engineering leadership identified the problem and released the product with a known flaw (ethically corrupt). When one clicks the link, it does not perform as expected, as it displays the tracking information for the order, not the contact information for the vendor. Having an autonomous and fully automated ordering system is great, but when there is a glitch and you cannot contact a human being to intervene and correct the problem, you quickly realize that Amazon’s goal is to completely eliminate human interaction.

Also, I enjoy watching Law & Order SVU, so more seasons of that and other similar shows would be great.

Auto play on TV episodes is hit and miss as to whether or not it’s going to work. There is no autoplay setting that I can find in the Apple TV app since the addition of profiles.   While we are on the subject of autoplay, the “are you still watching” is a nice feature but has horrible execution. The counter is apparently set to trigger after a certain number of episodes instead of on a timed interval.

It’s also ridiculous to be able to watch a season or two of a series and find out in order for continue watching, you must pay, not only for the next season, but again for each succeeding season. Or pay for selective seasons by having to subscribe to a service like Paramount+. One example: some seasons of the reality show Survivor are free but others, in no particular order, require a P+ subscription. In the years I have had Prime, I paid for one movie only to find it playing on TBS network.

It also happens on both iPad and iPhone apps.  Sometimes it will resume working when it select play, but usually it will continue to fail and Nothing but time will resolve it.

There’s no reason the movie / show should stop playing anytime I exit the app. Having to restart the show every single time I go to send a text or check my email is super annoying.   When pressing play, why does it default to portrait viewing instead of landscape…especially when my phone is already in landscape. The little “rotate screen” button isn’t useful because only rotates to landscape on one side. If your phone happens to be tilted to the other side, tapping the button to switch it to landscape turns the screen upside down. The only way to fix it is turn the phone upright again, wait for the app to register that the angle of the phone has changed, and then tilt it to the side again.  NO ONE cares about XRay enough for it to be the default view.   The only truly helpful and innovative feature is the swipe left or right to skip or go back 10 seconds. It’d also be great to have a slider for brightness in the app. Although I’m sure that’s not going to be considered since you wouldn’t want playback to be as convenient as it is on Netflix.",Needs basic functions added

The next episode automatically comes up and you have to backtrack, scroll, and watch 2 minutes of commercials to see the big reveal in the last few seconds of the episode.

However, I have a few complaints: My biggest gripe: I'm not a fan of subscription-based payments, so I believe the monthly Prime membership should include access the ALL content, not just some content. It needs a more functional layout (it's too cluttered looking). Also- the Search function is tedious and time consuming if you don't have a microphone, you have to click letter-by-letter with your remote and pause typing before it will populate matching results.

I graduated in marketing; marketers use real live people in focus groups & data they collect to market products effectually; they do not turn it completely  over to a computer program.    Marketing should make hard copies of each screen should look, and hand care them the coders.  They should copy the layout of each screen exactually as on the hard copies show.

More like 'V' movies or programs.  And if there  is a 'search' for a particular actor or director, the movies with some depth or interesting plots or where your search turns up movies of your actor choice, the best movies are NOT Am Prime.  They may not be 'V' movies, but they miss 'A' and 'B' by a long-shot!  And I was surprised at how few choices are Am Prime when I’m looking for work of a particular actor.  There may be two, maybe three selections, but that’s it.  And those selections are often not 'A' or 'B' either.

They also keep different versions of the same movie completely separate. For example I own the 3 latest Spider-Man movies. If I search Spider-Man three different versions of the latest one come up at the top. One of which it shows that I own. But if I keep scrolling the other two show up but not the versions that I own. I had to scroll down really far to get to the ones that I own. At least in the mobile apps it is obvious which ones you own. On the TV app you have to click on it to find out.,Trying to trick you.

1,2021-11-29 00:50:08,I enjoy quite a bit of the content on this streaming service but the video quality is poor on my Apple TV. I have 300 Mbps internet service and my Apple TV is hardwired to the router and none of my other streaming apps have any trouble with quality or buffering.  This app is a different story.  The first 3-5 minutes of any episode are such poor video quality (grainy/blurry) they’re difficult to watch and it reverts to this poor quality frequently throughout the episode.  Sometimes I’ll find something to watch on here then end up actually paying for it on a different app just to avoid the horrible quality.  The same app also has major audio sync problems on Roku.,Decent Content Bad Quality

1,2017-11-02 04:08:36,"First off, it’s annoying that just having a prime membership isn’t enough to watch most videos. You still have to subscribe to channels or rent shows in order to get access to most of the stuff worth watching. There isn’t even a premium package that includes everything, because each network requires its own subscription. But that’s not a problem with the app, just the service overall. The problem with the app is that you can’t even buy/Rent/subscribe to anything through it. You have to open up a browser and access the full site to do that, which makes absolutely no sense. I can’t imagine adding that functionality to the app would be so hard.",Really limited functionality
2,2017-10-11 22:08:02,The part that is the most frustrating for me is that you can’t see how much things are to rent or buy on phone you have to go to computer or full version which you can’t do on your phones or at least I haven’t found a way to do it. Then it wasn’t too bad for costs because you could at least watch older seasons of shows without paying. now it’s all of the seasons no matter how many years. The only free ones with prime are really old off the air and even then not as many are free with your prime subscription. I gave 2 stars because it does work nice when you find what you are looking for. Some kids shows are nice as well.,Somewhat a let down

Then on top of that I got to pay $17 of whatever to buy or purchase or rent movies. I don't mind that but sometimes I would like to be able to watch some classic TV without having to pay for it twice. I really wish you would consider putting a lot more classic TV for us to watch. Like I said, you're getting $12 a month, or maybe more, why do I have to pay for things twice?",My thoughts on prime video

If I’m watching anything on “free IMDB with ads”, every single time I have to restart the app or go to the phone settings to check Bluetooth connections or just do back and re open the show, I get incrementally more ads in front of my playhead, which means I may have watched 60 seconds of ads, and immediately be forced to dig 78 more, and then 90.

For some reason I can only add individual seasons of a show to my watchlist, I’ve tried to find a way to add the whole series, but can’t find out how, if it’s even possible. Also, rewatching a series is a pain because it always tries to start you off where you left off, which is usually the end credits, and the start from beginning button isn’t always there.

Once you rent, it says you have 30 days to watch your movie, the thing is, is that once you watch it once the movie is gone. So you pay to watch a movie thinking you have the rental for 30 days but you have 30 days to hit play. Once you watch it, that’s it. I think if your renting it you should get that movie to watch however many times you want for 30 days. It’s a little misleading.",Renting movies thumbs down

1,2022-12-23 06:29:17,"The Apple TV app for Prime Video is completely atrocious. It should be a required standard that video-play apps use the native tvOS video player. Scrubbing forward or back is awful,  no one cares about X-Ray, it does not automatically save your closed caption preference (which is incredibly discriminatory to hard of hearing folks or people who need that accessibility feature always on). UI is also atrocious. Navigating through the menus always leaves one frustrated and is not intuitive with the Apple TV Remote. This app needs a massive overhaul.",Apple TV app 👎👎👎

4,2022-04-01 14:42:33,The only thing that annoying me about this app is that you have to purchase most of the shows and movies like for a episode it is 3$ which can get annoying if you don’t feel like buying shows or movies.

Quite often there is some kind of network hiccup and my download stops and I lose it all... I could be 95% done with a movie and lose it all.

5,2018-02-11 04:11:41,I love prime video. Great selections and way better than Netflix  Only because there seems to be so many shows that are foreign language.

I rate this five stars. Thank you.,I Love Prime Video
5,2023-08-21 21:46:43,SO many good shows and new movies for free with prime! They even have the classics. Unlike other streaming services they constantly put out new free and different varieties of shows/movies without having to have a subscription to something added on!!,Favorite streaming service
5,2023-04-09 03:15:30,For as much as Prime cost we should be able to watch anything through the membership and not have to pay for ANNOYING ads! NOTHING on this app should cost anything extra especially since you have a Prime account. Very ridiculous!,ADS🙄

I always have to help my kid with navigation and search so he doesn’t get exposed to inappropriate rated content. With Netflix I don’t have to worry once my son is in kids profile.,Not kid friendly

I called and complained and even wrote to them, but it fell on deaf ears.  It got so bad, we stopped watching. We’ve moved on and now it’s just Apple TV, Netflix and Britbox.   Nothing is free folks.

It’s beyond annoying.   PLEASE FIX THIS!! Until then, I’ll be using my  Verizon Fios TV app exclusively.",Bring back features!

4,2019-03-31 00:58:04,Prime is a great streaming service but the need to align themselves with other great tech companies such as Apple and IPTV  they will crush Google and Netflix which is already becoming antiquated with its content has become less and less appealing other than some of their self created programming.,The future of streaming

Have to restart to get it to work. This does not occur on Roku systems. So either Apple is sabotaging it to get people to use their platform or the developers choose not to fix it. Only app that does this? 🧐,Horrible on Apple TV

Just a bit ugly and clunky.   - Bonus Content for movies and TV shows gives really cool and relevant info or trivia while you watch. It’s a unique feature of Prime Video’s and its praiseworthy.   - Ads for other Prime content plays at the beginning of most videos and gives you one more thing to have to interact with when you’re just trying to binge.   - To my knowledge there’s no way of telling Prime what your video preferences are so it can better recommend new things.,Good selection.

There are a few good quality movies and shows. I will admit that. But when all the Rocky movies are labeled as “prime” and I watch 1,2 and 3 and then a day later they want me to pay for 4 and 5 when it was literally included in prime isn’t cool.   It is what it is.

1,2020-09-21 00:36:22,"As a subscriber, I find 80% of available streaming picks are PAY-PER-VIEW and what is available via ones subscription is CRAP.

3,2023-04-28 21:27:25,"I could care less about the new format and look, but subtitles are messed up now. It used to be that movies and shows would always play with subtitles because I turned them on. Now every time I watch something, I have to turn subtitles back on, even if it’s the same movie that I just started earlier that day. If you’re going to make it that subtitles are automatically off, then at least make it a setting option to have them automatically on vs automatically off. I’m someone that uses subtitles all the time, and I’ve never had to turn them back on for the same movie every time I re-open the app and press resume. Every other streaming app and previously prime video too, if you turn subtitles on once for one movie or show, they stay on for everything until you turn them back off. That’s how it used to be and that is better. Now I have to hit pause, turn subtitles on, go back 10-30 seconds, then I can resume my movie with subtitles on. At least make an option in settings to have subtitles automatically on or off, plus the ability to change it for an individual movie or show.   Also it’s buffering and lagging more than before. In my case, it could be the area I’m in bc I have no wifi and most places have poor cell service, but prime video is still acting up more than any other streaming apps I use.

3,2021-08-22 02:53:12,"I watch prime video mostly on my computer, except at night when I watch it in bed to fall asleep to. I have almost 0 complaint while watching movies/shows on the PC, but about 50% of the time that I swap to my phone and try to cast the show to my bedroom TV at night, I have no option to cast. I don’t know what is constantly breaking that removes my ability to cast to any device at all (the entire option is gone when this happens!) but it needs to stop. I have to pay for another streaming service just to be able to watch TV consistently at night because this app isn’t reliable at all in that department. A quick google search shows that I am not alone in this complaint. Why it hasn’t been fixed by now is beyond me.   Besides the casting issue, I also have problems with auto play. I turned off automatic playing for the next episode when I was watching something  on the computer one day, and that setting didn’t carry over to my phone when I casted from it later on. I then turned the auto play off on my phone as well and now my entire account is broken and no matter what option I set it to on my phone or on the computer (auto play on or off), I can now no longer have the next episode of any show automatically play. I have to manually select to move forward to the next episode both on my computer and on my phone, which is an issue (again) when trying to fall asleep to any show. It’s an inconvenience at my PC, but a bigger issue for my sleep routine. Again, I’m having to pay for other streaming platforms to pick up the slack for this app.   I will say that the selection is great, for free movies as well as for purchases, and other than the issues I listed here, it’s been decent. If the prime video was a separate subscription from the prime membership, I’d have cancelled it due to the issues I’m having… but as it’s an included service and costing me nothing extra at this time, it’s a good bonus to your prime membership if you don’t mind some functionality glitches.",The app lets me down
