Though it would be nice if Max can add all of the discovery plus TV shows and documentaries like how it is on the freestanding discovery plus app. Things like the Megastorm is not available, which talks about the typhoon that hit the Philippines. Also, under my list, I would like to see movies and TV shows separated into one area or a group. So, for example, when I click on my list, I would like to see, not just to continue watching option, but also a movies option which separates the movies from the TV shows and one into one category for movies, and then an option for TV shows where the TV shows are separated into their own thing which will make it easier for users to tell which one is a movie and which one is a show. So if we can get that that would be great. All in all, this is better than HBO Max. Especially with accessibility. Before I used to have to scroll down to see my watchlist. Now it’s just like all of the other apps where I can just click the left menu bar and then I have an option to click on watch list. I like it.",Awesome App
4,2023-05-23 09:17:33,"Overall, I’m mostly impressed with Max! HBO Max always had performance issues on some of my devices (including newer iPhones, but especially on an older iPad). But Max feels way smoother most of the time, with better search and scrolling performance. Also, with my existing year long HBO Max subscription, I continue to get 4k HDR at seemly pretty high bitrates (possibly higher than HBO Max?), so it makes me very happy that I wasn’t screwed over. On top of that, we get more content now. Even though HBO has far superior TV, sometimes you want to relax with HGTV or something similar, so I’m happy this is now an option without needing to pay more.   My hope is that they continue pushing Max to be a great platform in a way that multiple disparate underinvested platforms can’t be. My fear is that quality content from HBO doesn’t get the investment it deserves under the new WBD merger. (I guess we’ll see.) One thing I am VERY disappointed in is the decision to cancel nearly finished movies and to remove completed, reputable shows like Westworld from the platform. How does that make any sense?   Honestly, the weird licensing deals which make it very confusing about what’s available where and when need to die, and it seems like Max is a step in the right direction from a company that has enough properties that one service could actually be consistently valuable. So far I’m impressed and cautiously optimistic.",Much better performance and more content

Did you enjoy being able to press the menu button to easily navigate to separate pages for ‘Last Chance’ and ‘Just Added’ items in the HBOMax app? Too bad. Gone. Now they’re just tiny rows located who knows how far down on the home page that you’ll have to side scroll through and also who knows how these choices are organized, because it’s certainly not alphabetical. Did you enjoy having your watchlist arranged in alphabetical order? Well, too bad. Now it’s arranged in some arbitrary order that you can’t change. Remember how you were at least able to arrange your watchlist in alphabetical order (even though it didn’t stay that way the next time you opened the HBOMax app and you had to choose alphabetical order every time)? Oh well. Not anymore. I never knew just how important alphabetical ordering was to me until it was removed from this app. So far, I’ve only started up one thing since the revamp and it had no issues starting, so that’s good at least. The lack of organization and organization options is aaarrrggggghhhhhh though!   On the plus side, it automatically logged me in so I didn’t have any issues there.   P. S. Bring back Metalocalypse.",They should change the name to Min(imum) because they removed key elements
2,2023-06-18 06:51:27,"Great options of shows & movies to watch however I have multiple problems when streaming from my phone to my TV. One, once I connect to TV it does not let me operate the rewind & pause from my phone like it typically should. Also it does not let me use subtitles at all when casting to TV which is very frustrating when I am hard of hearing. The tool menu pops up at the bottom of the app but no matter how many times I press subtitles on, or press pause, or rewind, it does not work. Sometimes the tool menu even pops up with no buttons AT ALL & I cannot control the movie. flawed and frustrating. I have no control over the movie or show I am watching, cannot pause, rewind, fast forward, or turn subtitles on. Also once I have streamed no matter how many times I close the app or turn my TV off & on it does not stop streaming, even after the app has been removed from my open & live section on my phone it is some how streaming in the background?? And for HOURS. I played a show around 11am then turned my TV off & removed the app from my open list then at 10pm I turn my tv on & re-open MAX & it immediately streams the same exact movie from 12hours ago?? Why did the movie not close from the lower tool bar & have the app reset like it should. Multiple problems of this app not resetting properly.

1,2023-06-01 22:31:33,"I am not sure how they messed up an app that was pretty good. The last update to the HBO max app ruined a lot of the features. I guess that was sign for how the new Max app was going to work. Not sure why they created a whole new app, makes no sense to rebrand it, everyone knows it’s HBO, but to discard all the good things that were created in the last app, and only add the bad things, doesn’t seem reasonable. When I first downloaded the HBO max app several years ago, it was full of bugs, but over the course of several updates they really smoothed it out. It ran very fast, worked as needed and seemed to anticipate changes that were needed by customers. That all changed in the last update and then the new app. I combine them as one because the problems of slow scrolling, bad menu displays and accessibility are the same. How do you fix this, just make it like your previous app and that should do the trick. I don’t understand how it’s so buggy, maybe by design? Your rebranding attempt was a failure.  The menu function to quickly go to Last Chance or other movie genres was a very feature one that was removed in this new app. I have read reviews that people are perplexed that others have written good reviews of this app, most likely it’s HBO employees or people who never used the old app, because it was far superior, at least before the last update.","New app, even worse functionality."
2,2023-05-31 12:10:24,"Have y’all over there at Warner Brothers development team ever heard the phrase if it’s not broken, don’t fix it? If so, why did you break HBO max? You used to have a bunch of cool features like being able to shuffle which would keep the program running for as long as you like. Now I have absolutely no option but to watch from season one episode one (or wherever I actually start the show from) until the finale. It also used to keep the shows in my list after watching the whole show because it’s still your show. No you must go back in there to the search. Find your show again. Just play it so you can go to sleep. How about the recently added or last chance sections of HBO max that are missing from this new app. While I will admit, I did not use those functions frequently. I did appreciate having them available. I’ll give you two stars because the application does work. It does play the content requested but the original HBO max was at least by comparison a five star product compared to the two that I get this which is a mild stretch. Warner Bros dev team I understand that you guys have to justify your paychecks and feed your families a man next time in executive says that we need to revamp the whole ******* thing.

3,2023-05-26 22:25:24,"I’m actually really upset at the amount of people giving this good reviews. I have had nothing but issues the day I started using it. I’m currently rewatching a show & for some reason Max doesn’t want to leave it in my continue watching & on the progress bars it shows I’m no where through any of the episodes. If I can remember what episode I left off on, I can click on it & it resumes me at a random part of the video, not where I left off, or even at the beginning. Another issue I have is that when I click the skip intro option, it will sometimes (about half the time) only go through half of the intro but the skip button is no longer available. Not only are there issues, but y’all also took away features. Like the being able to upload one of your own pictures to your profile? Now, like Disney +, it only allows you to choose from the characters in some of their movies/tv shows, & the only options are honestly all the new or up incoming things, some of your most popular entertainment isn’t even an option. I just find it strange to remove features. I guess I just expected for Max to be this great new thing but was extremely let down.

I have done the simple updating, delete and redownload, restart the devices, and I keep having the typical problems that should’ve been easily fixed with an update. the screen freezes at the choosing accounts screen and i cannot do anything besides exit out the app completely, and every show I watch will not stay on my continue watching.

1,2023-06-09 09:30:24,HBO max used to be a place where people can come together. Now it is a place where they isolate people. I own an HBO max account. I have now moved it to the “max” app where things are apparently different. Let me tell you why things are different. I own several different television sets. I have my own HBO or what I used to calll HBO on every single tv set. Now I for some reason can only use one or 2 television sets with MAX. So glad they changed it and upgraded their software to make it even more terrible than it was before. I can’t watch with more than 2. I work hard for those televisions and I want to enjoy every single one of them. All I want to do is watch  a show that I used to be interested in and this new update is ruining tv and as well as going along with our country’s new values that some people in this country have decided to partake in. I refuse to be apart of that. And while I do refuse to step foot in these childish political issues I cannot help but say that it is disappointing that HBO or as we now call it “MAX” is deciding to adhere to these insane ideas hurts me and is ruining American television and I can say that there are some great shows on the app. I just wish “MAX” as they call it can do what everyone in America wants them to do and make a change FOR THE GOOD instead of negative which is what I believe is happening right now.,What happened ?
4,2023-05-24 19:33:36,"I’ve been using HBO Max since 2020, and I’ve enjoyed the selections that have been available, with only a few exceptions (looking at you, Dragonball Evolution). When I managed to access Max (which transferred my account with no issues), I did notice that I had some personal issues with the User Interface. It’s not to say that the interface is terrible, but it is certainly lacking when you compare it to HBO Max’s UI. Selections are categorized by genre without a clear option for seeing selections from A-Z (it does have alphabetical order for genres, but it feels somewhat tedious to go through each genre to find what you’re looking for, especially if your choice is listed under multi genres). The service is also lacking dedicated pages for new titles and titles that are being cycled out of the service, and the section for titles leaving Max doesn’t notify you that the titles are leaving by the end of the month (I think a lot of people would appreciate having that feature on Max). Again, I still enjoy it, but I’d appreciate it if elements from HBO Max’s UI were reintroduced to Max.","I enjoy the service, not so much the UI"
2,2023-08-22 00:48:49,"When Max first launched, it had issues. First of all, I use a Chromecast to cast it from my iPhone to my television. From the very beginning, I would have issues with it tracking my progress through a series. I would watch 3 episodes and when I came back to start again, it would start me halfway through the 2nd one I watched last time. Also, the “new episode” badge remains even after you have watched the new episode. Those were annoying, but not deal breakers. Now, though, my TV remote that used to pause a show no longer functions that way. Also, clicking into the show on my phone while it is casting to my TV no longer shows the progress bar like it used to… so I can’t easily tell how long I have to go or how long a movie is. The latest development is that the pause button won’t even work on the phone now either. They only way I can pause the show is to disconnect from the Chromecast altogether.   I have detailed all these issues in previous reviews… but strangely my 2 star reviews and complaints keep disappearing from the reviews list while the 4 and 5 star reviews remain. Maybe this one can actually stay up and people can get an honest view of the limitations of the app.",Getting worse rather than better
4,2023-08-10 03:17:29,"The Discovery Network now runs HBO, so with the new Max app came a bunch of commercial tv shows from the Discovery family. For those of us seeking HBO's content, we now have to sift through programming that we didn't sign up for like the pimple-popper cartoons and other tv programming owned by Discovery. It's cluttered the app substantially, heading in the direction of Netflix & Prime where they bury what you're looking for in order to push other shows at you. Not a fan of that. Whether using Max on Roku or a mobile device, there needs to be much more direct way to go straight to HBO programming only. My Home screen now features shark shows, children's shows, and other non-HBO shows - the shows I've been trying to get away from, which is why I have been subscribing to HBO for years. Conversely, people seeking Discovery content now have to sift through HBO shows. The app needs to better separate and categorize the content and make the channels simpler to directly access instead of trying to force feed me things I've got zero interest in.","HBO great, but not the Discovery content"

It’s the worst of capitalism. They want you to be frustrated. They hope you’ll start a new show and lock you in further. End your subscription asap! Only subscribe when you want to watch something specific. Search only for that. And this isn’t just a Max (stupidest rebranding EVER) thing. This dark design pattern is on all the streaming apps. It’s gross. And the only way we can change it is to not fall for it! Cancel you subscriptions as soon as you can. Don’t forget you can cancel immediately after subscribing. You’ll have a full month paid for. Subscribe again in a month if you want to continue watching. They hope you forget. Or that you get sucked into something else because you can’t find what you were just watching.  UPDATE:  oh wow! There is recently played.

I used to pay for it and canceled it because I can’t stand how bad the application is. Then I got access to it again because it’s now included in my AT&T membership. I’m now contemplating about switching to another carrier so I can take this application out of my life, simply because of this one issue. It happens every other day; when I open the application, I have to connect my provider from scratch every single time.   This last time it was really infuriating. I downloaded a movie to watch while I’m traveling. Next, I’m traveling, and when I clicked on the application it asked me to connect my provider again. When I did it and went to downloads, it no longer showed the downloaded movie there. The funny part is the application still holds the space required for the movie, so it’s there, but I can’t watch it or delete it. I guess I needed a good excuse to delete the application altogether, and come here to write this rant.

I also enjoy the new navigation menu. all of these changes have brought a new era to Max. But.

At first I was mad, as the only thing I watch on HBO…….WAIT IM SORRY! The only thing I watch on MAX……is South Park. That’s it. I’ve seen every episode multiple times and my depressed autistic husk of a body needs familiarity after suffering through the day. But you know what? Screw it! Lets make using this app more inconvenient and remove a cool feature for no reason! That is Steve Jobs level on innovation . Whoever’s GENIUS thought that was deserves a raise and a nice back running because GOD KNOWS HES HAD A STRESSFUL WORK FILLED DAY!

3,2023-05-30 05:14:33,"Hi, I’ve had hbo max for a long time now, but ever since the new update to max, it’s had a lot of bugs. Before the update I’d finish a series and be able to restart it from the start without playing at the ends of episodes. Also while it goes to the next episode, as well as starting from the end, it wil now sometimes close the app on the tv out. Additionally, it won’t save series under currently watching if they had been watched before and when restarted it still doesn’t save it. Not sure why these bugs are now here but hope they get fixed soon. It’s become almost impossible to watch as well as a lot of the cartoon series are being dropped and some missing episodes. Like Clarence is now gone and regular show is missing episodes. I thought Cartoon Network was bought out by whoever ultimately is over the Warner brothers shows but now they are disappearing after getting them so that doesn’t make sense. Not sure why but hope all these problems, and series get back soon. Thank you, I really appreciate it.",New update has many bugs
1,2023-09-01 23:53:47,"Update: I reported it to Max using the link in the developer response before they responded to me. Not a great sign that they’re listening to any of this criticism.   Original: Max also does away with the side menu hub. Now you have to scroll to get to the hubs. This is significantly less convenient than HBO Max, with its side menu hubs. Max doesn’t do personalized recommendations like HBO Max used to do. It just recommends the things it spent a lot of money on line And Just Like That, Friends, and South Park. Max doesn’t allow you to not play the next episode. If you back out of the auto play countdown when it starts, the rest of the episode will play, but the back button no longer works until the next episode starts. All the reality TV garbage I never wanted and never watch now clutters the app while browsing it. HBO Max used to be the app I could browse and find something I wanted to watch. I can’t do that in this app. Too much garbage content in a garbage layout. It also did away with the native Apple TV player, so now we have to do things like turn off subtitles when they randomly turn on and press twice to go back or forward instead of once.","So irritating, I hate using the app"
1,2023-07-10 01:58:19,"I don’t know what’s wrong with this app? The previous HBO max app had a whole host of problems, and some of them have been resolved here. However, the new app seems to have introduced a bunch of new problems. We have a TV with Chromecast, so casting the app from my phone is the only way to watch HBO on our TV. The app constantly loses its place in whatever show we’re watching. Anytime we pause the show for a bathroom break and come back, the show starts from an entirely different spot that we’ve already watched (sometimes starting from a previous episode). Then, we have to search for the spot we were at, and the scrubbing doesn’t show thumbnails of the current screen as I search. It’s a big game of guess and check, and each time I guess, I have to wait 15 seconds for the show to load before finding out if I’ve guessed correctly. Sometimes if the app is feeling especially spiteful, it will throw an error and log me out completely. There’s also no “skip recap” or “skip intro” button when casting from the phone which is just annoying. Why create an entirely new app if it’s no better than the last? Just frustrating",Worse than the previous app
4,2023-05-26 00:52:29,"I see plenty of reviews complaining about the app not loading or installing on tvs and crashing tvs along with crashing other apps.. for me personally, I have two tvs, a Hisense 55” google tv and a Samsung 50” google tv that when I opened the HBO Max app I was prompted to download the new MAX app which was downloaded and installed on both tvs just fine. Both tvs opened the app with my account Information already switched over and logged in, both tvs had all my profiles on them ready to select and open just fine, both tvs also play everything in the content including the new SHAZAM movie. It is also nice having quite a bit of added content from Discovery+ to view as well, however my one gripe is that the Samsung tv does run really slow in the app and the quality constantly suffers due to that, in movies and/or tv shows even though that tv is newer, higher quality and closer to the WiFi router. Otherwise no other complaints so far. Happy viewing!","Mostly Hit, Unfortunate Miss.."
3,2023-11-02 18:46:44,"I love the selection of movies and shows so much that MAX has become my most-used streaming app lately. The only downside would be the bugs while using the app on my iPhone. Sometimes when I open the app and start a new episode, I’ll watch the ads and then realize I can’t pause, close, or do anything with the app. My only choice is to lock my phone and re-open the app. Then my episode starts over and I have to watch ads again. Shows will sometimes start playing out of nowhere when I connect Bluetooth, plug in my charger, answer calls, or unlock my phone, even when the app is just operating in the background. The last bummer is that I have to sign in way more often now. No one uses my account but me, so it’s a little frustrating to enter my credentials so often. That said though, the rest of the experience is great and it’s overall worth it. I especially like that more TV episodes have a single long ad at the beginning so there is no interruption in the middle!",Great Selection but Some Bugs
2,2023-06-13 02:36:50,"As of writing this, a couple days after HBO Max became “Max,” I need to state that this new app / change needs a lot of work. After I launched the app on my cell phone & on my TV, a Roku device, the first issue that appeared was my “Continue Watching” no longer had shows I was watching & listed movies that I had finished watching & removed from my list. When I searched for the show I was watching, it was not appearing but when I searched for them on my Roku device, it read the show was on “Max” & when I selected it, it led me to the show on the streaming service. The inconsistency is the first issue. The second & biggest is the audio is out of sync on my shows. There is at least a 5 second delay with the audio when I was able to begin watching my show. The out of sync is also with the searching & selecting process itself. This new version needs a lot of refining.  Update: thank you for the response to my review, I troubleshooted the app on all my devices & followed the link provided & it did fix the issue I was experiencing.",The new “Max” needs work
3,2023-05-23 22:09:07,"I know it seems harsh docking 2 stars for organization but I haven’t fully explored the rest of the app so I don’t know if there’s anything else wrong. Anything else I might politely object to. The reason I haven’t fully is because from what I can tell it just has “tv”, “movies”, “hbo”, “new & notable”. Whereas the old HBO Mac organization and menu format was more extensive than just the standard Netflix-esque “we’ve separated tv and movies, now scroll”. The things mentioned in the app description at the time of this comment was, not necessarily in this order, “DC Universe”, “Harry Potter”, “Food Network”, “Magnolia Network”, “TLC”, “HGTV”, “Adult Swim”, and “HBO”. However, it’s only “TV”, “Movies”, “HBO”, and “new”. Where this is going is. Is there a way to separate all of those networks/franchises and other stuff (like cartoons and other stuff) in a tab system similar to the old one? Like how other apps and the old version did? Not the same obviously, but similar. A new app doesn’t mean everything has to be different.",Organization system needs work.
1,2023-05-24 16:50:35,"The whole rollout of Hbo Max’s new “Max” platform is an absolute joke. First off, on launch day Max wasn’t even available on my Roku TV. Tried to google how to make it work but the internet doesn’t know what Max is, only what HBO Max is so all troubleshooting for “max” was useless. Waited for them to fix all their disastrous errors and tried to log in the next day. All of a sudden my password is not correct and to update my password I used the web address provided on my tv screen. Each time on the web address you clicked Sign In it would take you to the App Store to download the Max app. Once the app was downloaded I proceeded to attempt sign in using the forgot password option, it emailed a link that I then updated my Password ON A WEB BROWSER!! What did I need the app for? This whole thing is completely not worth even having the service anymore and even though it’s minor in the grand scheme of life, in the moment it was frustrating enough for me to consider cancelling my subscription that’s increasing in price anyway with this new rollout. Cool. Thanks, Max. 👎🏼",Whoever decided Max should be a thing needs to be fired.
2,2023-09-28 04:26:10,"There's a lot more stuff on the channel since the rebrand to Max, but poor layout and navigation decisions have made it difficult to wade through all the crap to find something worth watching. More is not better, it's just more, kinda like cable. (And they have removed some things.) Finally, the flashy start-up graphics ignore my iPad's reduce motion settings. They are painful to watch. Might be time to drop this app until those who thoughtlessly mandated this poor reinvention of the wheel get their act together. Update: now I'm getting emails to request participation in a survey. Are they using a new team that has no access to the years of customer interactions that went into the development of this app's forerunners? I don't like wasting my time simply because a company doesn't value the institutional memory of its previous development teams. A lot could also be improved by focusing on best practices when it comes to user interfaces and accessibility.  UPDATE: I do not want CNN in this app. I don't open it for news. Yuk.",Max Mishmash
2,2023-05-27 09:39:36,"HBOMax was classy, well organized, easy on the eyes, and a great app. Performance suffered in recent months, I assume as the Max app was being developed. The blue is obnoxious. The removal of recaps of prior episodes of TV shows stinks (make it an option if you want to do that, but those recaps added so much to the experience in setting up the episode). Worst, when watching minimized, the jump to the next episode drops out the player entirely. I can literally spend 12 hours with your app playing. Switching back to the main app constantly in that time is obnoxious & HBOMax did not work that way; even more ridiculous, if I don’t switch right away, the show may start playing in the background with no player visible(!) & that next episode startup may happen immediately OR even 30 minutes later, out of the blue! The new UI is the pits - ugly color, bad organization. And you dropped the HBO name which was the best connotation there was for denoting quality. (Cine)Max has no class & never has.

They have mixed together many different classifications from science to children's to comedy, adult anime to fantasy to war movies in same category. I have love stories and ancient history in same category. Terribly disappointed that they are unable to get this together. An AI Chatbot would do better. They have many excellent programs, finding them is really hard now that they have combined so many different types of programs under 1 classification. I frequently give up and go someplace else. HBO used to be famous for their series. They mixed up series from every channel they carry now. They have made their streaming service as difficult as they could to watch.

Y’all even made the color scheme more basic and lame, PURPLE WAS SO MUCH BETTER. And on top of all this you removed the HBO from your name which is just stupid.

2,2023-09-18 14:28:15,"App functionality continues to get worse with every update unfortunately (using an updated iPhone 13). Casting is next to impossible: episodes will re-start randomly while you are watching them, volume will max out, and your episode progress won’t be saved. Casting also lacks a “skip intro” button which is sub-standard for streaming apps.   Apart from casting, if you try to re-watch a series, or jump around episodes, your progress will not be saved under “continue watching” on the home page. This forces you to manually search the show you were watching every time, guess what episode you were on, and guess how far in you were. Extremely inconvenient.

I hate this new format and literally want to cancel my service and stop using it. I don’t know who’s genius idea it was to take something that worked just fine and totally change it. The “start from beginning” option is gone, the subtitle function is more difficult to use now and the user experience has gone from a 9 to a zero. Instead of rewinding properly you just get a sound that makes it seem like something is happening but nothing is… I have to think they’ll change it back to how it functioned before but nowadays people just change things for absolutely no reason.

The app is also eternally incapable of remembering where I am in an episode or even which episode I’m on whether I watch in on my computer, iPad, or Apple TV. This is your only choice to watch HBO shows, it’s just bad. Update: The developer reached out to offer “help” which was just a link to the downloads page. I understand very clearly that downloads are valid for thirty days after download and for 48 hours after they are started.

I gave it a 3 star because if I watch a new show or any show for that matter, when I stop, I expect to be able to come back to pick up where I left off.  This new app doesn’t even remember that I watched the show at all, let alone which episode I stopped at.  That is frustrating.

From popular HBO series like Game of Thrones and Westworld to cult classics like Friends and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, HBO MAX offers a diverse range of TV shows and movies.  The user interface of HBO MAX is sleek and user-friendly, making it easy for even first-time users to navigate and find the content they want to watch. The search bar is intuitive and works well to find specific titles without fuss.  One notable feature of HBO MAX is its section of original content, featuring unique and innovative programs like Lovecraft Country, Raised by Wolves, and Euphoria. These shows are not only entertaining but also tackle important social and cultural issues, making them stand out from other streaming platforms.

1,2023-07-12 20:22:53,"Hello  I am currently on a family vacation, during which I decided to download HBO content for offline viewing. To my surprise, the downloaded movies my kids were enjoying suddenly became unavailable today. According to the app, these downloads expire after either 28 days or 48 hours from the first viewing.  Our current location is an extremely remote area with minimal cell service, relying on EDGE or 3G when available. It has taken considerable effort to find a spot where I can even write this review. Furthermore, there is no Wi-Fi access here, as we are situated in a mountainous town that is approximately two hours away from reliable cell coverage.  Initially, I presumed that the HBO app merely required a revalidation of the download by connecting to the servers. Thus, I tethered my iPad to my phone, but to my disappointment, it started attempting to download the entire movie again.  While I understand that contractual agreements with studios can influence content availability, it is worth noting that some of the content in question is owned by HBO/AT&T, indicating that these restrictions were implemented internally for reasons unknown to me.  In contrast, competing streaming platforms such as Netflix do not impose similar limitations. I suggest considering a thorough review of the features offered by your competitors, as I am now inclined to choose Netflix over HBO due to these download restrictions.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.",Offline on vacation
3,2023-09-16 21:55:55,"This is one of my favorite networks and I’m mostly reviewing the app for TV, not mobile devices. Since the transition from HBO Max to Max, everything I watch through the TV app has been sticky and glitchy. For example, I’m currently watching a show. When I hit pause, then play to start again, the show reverts to the very beginning or goes back three scenes, instead of picking up where it left off. It also freezes and crashes on a very regular basis and sometimes doesn’t remember shows I’m watching so I can continue watching them.. I hope this is just all part of growing pains, and that the current bugs will be squashed as new versions get updated. I’m also so bummed that I can’t choose my own avatars. I used to have cute photos of the users in my home and now I’m being forced to select from cartoon characters that I know nothing about.",Oof

When I open the settings on my phone to turn the descriptive audio off, it doesn’t even display it as an option. Every once in a while, it’ll do the same thing, but get stuck in a different language and won’t even allow me to turn the subtitles on to cope with it I can watch the show on my phone just fine, but the problem arises when I project it to my TV. currently I don’t have a remote for my TV… So I can’t just open up Max on my TV and play it there but I imagine that’s gonna be a problem then too… This app is a mess, no idea why y’all would switch to a whole new app with whole new problems, but it’s really really frustrating and I’m thinking I’ll cancel my subscription.",Audio Bug is driving me CRAZY

Not happy at all with th recent update…when resuming an episode it won’t pickup where you left off, no….it will start over. Every time. So now I have to make note of how far along in an episode I am if I have to stop an episode and exit out of the app. Also, episode progress bar(to show how many episodes you’ve watched) is not showing.

Transitioning between the previously mentioned devices is not smooth and I constantly have to remember where I left off on the previous device and fast-forward on a new device since the app can’t seem to remember.  After pausing a playback, it might start where you paused it, it might go back 10 seconds, it might go back 20 minutes… you never know what it’s going to do.  And the “For You” section is a joke. Stuff I would never watch, but there is no option to remove the suggestion, or to like/dislike something to improve the suggestions. I’m also writing this review when the playback decided to stop, which it does often. I have to go back to the main screen and restart the show from there for it to start again.",Not worth the price
2,2023-06-21 20:43:29,"The previous HBO app was wonderful. I don’t like anything about the new app, aside from it having all HBO content.  Which is also a part of my problem with it. To much content. It just doesn’t seem very well organized to have to navigate through SO much content that I have no interest in, before I stumble across something I want to watch.  I think the fast forward/rewind in 10 second increments is extremely slow, compared to other apps and including the old HBO, which was great. Not sure if it’s do to all the additional media, but it’s just very slow. I also do NOT like that the progress bar only shows time remaining in a program, as opposed to also including time watched, like it use too.  I also get a lot of blank black screen issues if I fast forward. A program will start just fine, but if I fast forward through the opening credits, only the audio will work, as the video just drops completely out to a pitch black screen. That happened on Very Rare Occasions on the old app, maybe once a month or longer. With the new app it’s almost daily. So I constantly have to reboot my Apple TV device. I suppose it could be a compatibility issue with the Apple TV, but the old app didn’t have that problem.   Those are just a few issues I have with MAX. I wish I could go back to the old HBO MAX!

1,2023-06-04 07:24:36,"First off, the branding is ugly and the blue light is absolutely blinding when it comes on my TV. Secondly, why inconvenience your customers by making them download a completely different app, and if you plan on doing that, why not make the app work properly before launching it??? The app crashes constantly across all platforms, freezes nonstop, it’s harder to find what I’m looking for, and my biggest problem with Max (other than the fact that it freezes and crashes every time I try to use it) is: when I try to rewatch episodes of a show I’ve seen all the episodes of, the show is no longer in my continue watching, no matter how many times I restart it. And when I play an episode, every single time, it starts at the very end instead of the beginning, causing me to have to back out and press restart, which usually causes the app to crash. Such a horrible idea executed in the worst way.",Everything about the switch to Max was a mistake.
1,2023-05-25 03:19:29,"Garbage app from garbage monster David Zaslav. This thing never remembers what I was watching or which episodes I already watched. It also keeps taking me back to the top of the home page rather than where I was in the home page so I have to keep finding everything over and over. Titles that start with “A” or “The” are filed under “A” and “T” because the people who made this app are dimwits. And it no longer tells you the writer and director. It just has some vague label that says “Creators” and then just lists a bunch of names in random order and you don’t know who did what. This is because Zaslav hates creatives and wants to muddy the waters between scripted and unscripted. And there needs to be an option so that none of those awful Discovery shows ever appear on my home screen. This merger has absolutely ruined Warner Bros and what was once  very respectable streaming service with an amazing library of content. Fix this garbage app, fire David Zaslav, and pay your writers!",Terrible app
1,2023-06-09 22:43:47,"HBO is responding to the complaints about its app not saving the most recent progress of a watched show or movie by asking the consumer to “reach out” so they can help. That would be great if this were something that was happening on the consumer’s side of things, but this is a bug in the app that needs fixing on the developer’s side.  I watch the MAX app on Roku. I’m sorry, but if your app can’t reliably remember the last show I watched, what episode I was on, and where in the episode I left off, why would I even continue paying for your service? The HBO Max app did not have these problems, but your new app doesn’t even add what I’m watching to my continue watching list most times. Weirdly, sometime’s my progress is there and other times the show isn’t even available in my continue watching list. I have updated the app on every device yet the problem remains.   How about you guys fix this instead of putting the responsibility onto the consumer?",Terrible App
2,2023-05-26 04:05:25,"I really don’t like the new app. The old one was pretty good, and it actually had a usable, recognizable name. Now it just seems like some dumb conglomerate of companies, like Disney but kinda stupid. Just call it what it is, HBO.  In terms of acquiring it, I had no idea they changed until HBO Max told me it doesn’t work anymore and to get the new app, so I did. Luckily, everything moved over without me even having to put in a password or anything, which is great because I’m using someone else’s account, but not so great for your security.  Now, for the app itself, it has some glitches, just a couple little things that make me instantly upset that I had to change apps, but they’re mostly minor bugs that could probably be patched in the next update. Still, not happy.  I give it two stars cause I wanted to give it one because I don’t like change, but I’m being generous in that the app itself works alright.",Ugh

Will have to wait and see if this is more than just a cosmetic fix.  Edit: After using it for a few days I’m changing my ratings. After the last update, this app seems to perform much better than their previous app. The UI/UX is still not good. For example, when I click on the title of a show, it starts streaming immediately when I just want to go and pick an episode to play. The play button and the title should have different functions.",Can’t see the difference
2,2023-05-26 04:47:10,"The app in it’s current state is buggy and has idiosyncrasies that HBO didn’t have. Like not only adding previews for other shows to the movie you’re watching but adding it to the timeline so that if you go to the beginning it starts the preview over.  However, the worse thing for me coming from HBO is the archaic practice of charging extra for 4K and HDR. The bandwidth costs to stream 4k over HD are negligible, making this a blatant money grab that keeps watching content the way creators intended out of reach for many viewers at $20/month. Ironically, 4k HDR is the one of the only advantages first party apps have over the numerous pirate sites out there, so by removing 4k HDR from standard plans they essentially remove one of the top reasons to pay vs pirate. I personally am willing to limit myself to services (like disney+ and apple tv) that don’t charge extra for 4K solely for principle. HBO had a loyal customer in me. Max, not so much.",Worse than HBO Max
1,2023-05-25 15:01:45,"I’m so annoyed. First off, the name change is dumb. I subscribed to HBO because of the power of the HBO brand. It’s synonymous with good, quality television. Rebranding to get rid of HBO makes it seem like you want to get rid of me as a customer.  As far as the app goes, there’s no reason you couldn’t just have renamed the existing app. Instead, making us all jump through a million hoops to download an entirely new app, for literally NO benefit to us as customers, is ridiculous and anti-consumer.   Finally, basic functionality is (still) missing, even from this new app. Every video app on every platform for literally decades now has had the same basic convention: you press the spacebar to pause or resume a video. This app doesn’t do that. As far as I can tell, there are no keyboard shortcuts to interact with the app at all. Given many, many people use their iPads attached to a Smart Keyboard (or any bluetooth keyboard), this is a baffling oversight that would be SO easy to fix if the company cared about making their app easy to use. (Is this a small thing? Of course, as much as I want to be able to tap the spacebar once to pause it instead of having to tap the screen twice. But it’s indicative of the complete lack of care being put into this.)  I don’t know why I should keep paying money for a service that seems to have no interest in putting its customers first.",Anti-customer nonsense

This app carries over many of the flaws that the old app had that I assumed would’ve been corrected with the launch of this one. When casting to a device, the option to pause or add subtitles doesn’t work. In addition there is no back or forward tracking option. Hopefully these issues will be corrected fairly soon.

In addition to the technical difficulties others have mentioned, the Continue Watching feature appears to be broken, as these shows/episodes never actually show up there. The biggest problem, though, is that the HBO content for which many subscribe is now hidden beneath a deluge of reality TV shows. It’s mainly relegated to the HBO hub, making it difficult to explore the app and find content. This change has completely destroyed the user experience. Max’s biggest advantage and draw - prestige TV - has been mostly replaced by the kind of worthless television that fills basic cable.

Even more insulting to your intelligence is when this pop up window is blocking a preview for another show or movie that is playing before the content you selected. It’s an ad on top of their own ad, all from the same company. Why would I change my mind and stream something else after I have already made my choice? Please remove these pop up ads of give an option to turn them off.  Also, interface elements do not disappear when content is playing.

The audio is corrupted and you hear what’s happening at least 30 seconds before you even see the events on the screen. Airplaying shows from Max on my iPhone onto Max on my smart tv is the only way to avoid this and it’s annoying. HBOMax was doing so good before it got switched to Max.

I constantly cast to chromecast from the app and it works maybe half of the time. On top of this, the app stretches the image which isn’t an issue but is off putting.   A big functional issue is when casting, there is no slider to rewind, fast-forward, play next episode or anything. This is highly unintuitive as wherever the video is becomes where you are stuck.  These functions do exist except that they are only there 40-50% of the time causing me to have to constantly disconnect, reconnect to the chromecast and hope the settings are there. THEN, once I finally close the app and get settled, if I ever wanna change the time again there’s a chance the options aren’t there and I’ll have to go through the whole process to obtain basic app functionality with time control in a streaming app.  0 stars for the functionality, 3 for content.",Good quality / poor implementation

I didn’t mind that the name changed, that the color scheme was different, or that I would have to completely redownload a new app. Then I started actually using it. I’m watching one of my shows and it keeps restarting where I am in the show. It will either rewind itself, jump to the end, or skip episodes either in the middle of me watching it or when I go to watch it the next time. Also, I started watching a new show and every time I log on it completely disappears from my continued watching and this happens whether it’s a brand new show or a show that I have already seen but want to watch again.

When I try to do anything with the audio it always says you can customize in settings, despite the fact the they could literally just do it on the home page or on the show or movie itself there is also nothing in the settings for it. When I try to chrome cast it has commercials and subtitles in English but won’t let me change the language from Spanish. When I try to watch on Roku the audio was audio description for English and English description so there was narration over the show.

For a while it also didn’t show the shows I was in the middle of watching in my “continue watching” list. I haven’t noticed that bug in a while, but I also don’t use this app as much as I used to because of all of the bugs. I also don’t like the new UI for shows at all. What was wrong with the grid??

First off, why did you get rid of the custom profile pic feature? I thought that was so cool and unique for a streaming service to allow people to customize their profile icon with photos from their phone. Second, I see a lot of purged anime from the service, and I highly doubt it’s because of your licensing with Sony expiring. It’s because your too lazy to put both English and Japanese version of said anime on the platform. The only anime you managed to keep both in English and Japanese were the Studio Ghibli films and you streamed the language separately. Overall, not a great start for a service such as this.

While you can search by hubs the process to get there is equally as aggravating as scrolling. The main page feels like a cluttered nightmare and the process of trying to find something to watch makes me just click out of the app and head to somewhere else. As a user of Discovery+ and HBO Max I can honestly say I never had a desire for the content to be smashed together, let alone in such an unappealing package.

Now you must view your list in the order in which you bookmarked the titles, which frankly is less than useless.  Why would they get rid of letting the customer choose?? Also, they got rid of the option menu (upper left corner of the old app).  It was very convenient for navigating around.  And it’s not as though they replaced it with anything better.

I pay a premium for HBO Max, and I expect the service to work flawlessly. But instead, I am forced to use my iPhone or AirPlay to watch HBO every time I want to use my Apple TV. This is a complete and utter inconvenience, and it is unacceptable.  To make matters worse, HBO has decided to rebrand itself as HBO Max. Is it the new Cinemax streaming service? Because that’s what it sounds like. I understand that HBO wanted to create a new brand that would appeal to a wider audience, but I think they made a mistake by changing the name from HBO to HBO Max. HBO was a well-known and respected brand, and I think the new name is confusing and unnecessary.

Additionally, when the substitutes are own, some episodes will just skip into the next episode 5 mins into it (this will not happen if the subtitles are off). Finally, as others have mentioned, the episodes do not start where I left off.

In order to access movies by genre, while in the movie section I have to scroll all the way to the bottom, but the app can’t keep up and I get stuck waiting for all the cute-name-suggestion categories to load. Then, once I’m in the genre, it offers Featured, A-Z. Series, and Movies instead of just movies. Then when you try to select Movies, the cursor automatically kicks back up to the suggestions for you, as you move through the four items, so you have to move the cursor back down each time. This interface is terrible. Please fix this. You have made it so much harder to find movies to watch.",New app is not great
5,2023-09-05 21:41:43,Navigation is better then all my other movie apps I have 4-5 the selection on max is great I think again better then the other apps I have if I had to make a complaint it’s that max does rotate movies instead of holding a growing library just like other apps I do not and have not liked that from any movie app but it like this if max doesn’t have it and someone els does I wish it had just been in max I prefer to use max somthing about the max app just feel better the any other movie app Iv ever used not just the ones I have,If it’s not on max I wish it was I prefer to use max

2,2023-05-27 18:41:44,"I love the shows that are on max but since the switch from hbo max to max i no longer have a “continue watching” section and it doesn’t keep my spot of where I’m at in a series so i have to remember where I’m at each time. Things are no longer alphabetical when searching. So the for ever scrolling to find something is annoying. THE PURPLE WAS ICONIC. Many other issues that are listed on other reviews i agree with. The app was perfect the way it was, downloading a whole new app for it to be like an off brand app is so disappointing considering the amount of push this new app got. All it needed was a name change and the additions of the newer shows & channels. The channels added is a very nice feature which i appreciate but the rest needs fixing",Max Needs Fixing

However, more and more HBO MAX or “MAX” as let go of these shows and others like it. I’m not really a fan of any of the new “originals” they put out so I really only watch anime and cartoons on this steaming service. Long story short if the platform keeps dispatching these shows I might have to move on completely because it’ll be kinda useless/ boring to keep paying $15  for service that I can only enjoy limitedly..

Even though they offer it as an option all they will do is charge you but then not allow you to log in and just show the screen that you need to subscribe. After calling help desk 3 time and sending 15 emails with no response the woman on the other side argued with me that it wasn’t their problem and that I hadn’t given them enough time to respond even though it had been two weeks. Absolutely terrible service all around.

They also made it so my older iPad cannot download it because it's on the previous version of iOS which is the latest version that iPad can be. The old HBO Max app works on that device, but this app cannot be installed on that version. It feels like poor planning and rollout by the company.  The app itself is ok, but not as nice as other streaming services. It's difficult to explore and find content on Max without it being on the first page. There's no recommendations for shows/movies, and even finding Max only content requires browsing into many catagories. It's basically just a name change to the old HBOMax app with more hassle and less device support.",please support older devices
1,2023-05-27 08:33:11,You really couldn’t just change the name of the app you already had? You had to kick everyone out and delete profile pictures just to watch “all the same stuff” in another app. You literally took things away from this app like being able to watch foreign films in their original language or in English. Majority you used to be able to switch back and forth with the click of a button. Now some are only English others are only for example Japanese or other languages I like the option and it’s much more satisfying to listen to a different language. That’s all I used the app for honestly so I will probably cancel the whole membership unless it’s fixed soon. Friends are doing the safe. Nice job doing nothing you guys ! 😎👍🏻🫡🤠,So pointless.

However, for some reason, if you start watching an episode and close the app, then try to reopen the app several minutes later, once I open the app, it will restart the entire episode when I did not even touch the bar?! Also it is not marking episodes as watched so if you fall asleep, good luck! You’re going to have a hard time knowing where you left off and it’ll restart the shows episode from whenever it decided to stop logging internally and it’ll restart it from the beginning.

I recently downloaded several movies and shows to watch on a flight, only to find once I was on my 6 hr trip that two of the three would not play back. I good-naturedly assumed that perhaps my app needed updating or there was a download problem.  Once I was at my destination, I checked that my app was up-to-date (it was), deleted the problem downloads, and downloaded several more things. Once again, I had that issue on my return trip.

The only option for me to remove my credit card info is to fill out a ‘Delete your data’ request and wait 45 days for you to “process the request and update what information you can based on my needs and your ability”.  You have no right to keep credit card info of people who are no longer your customers on your database. I have no faith you can keep my info safe in the case of a data breach.

5,2023-05-25 15:13:37,"Max is solid and nicely cleaned up. Bugs will be fixed. It's by far the best streaming app as far as content and execution, but a lot of room for improvement.   The UI/UX organization could be a lot simpler and deliver more value to the user. Apple TV+ has pretty much no content but the execution is way better and intuitive. Max feels like it's trying to mash things up in a way that keeps you sucked into the app versus just giving you what you want.  They should focus on elevating the brand, not finding the lowest common denominator. Thats reflected in both the name and color choice and also loading the app home page with reality tv schlock. Hide that stuff behind a hub. Don't hide HBO behind a hub. Literally should be doing the opposite.   Make the service stand out in the branding and highlight the best IP while making the garbage available but hidden.

I watch the Big Bang theory religiously and I have to actually type in the name EVERYTIME just to watch it because it completely disappears?? Not sure how if I watch it everyday. Also you know how it’s supposed to atleast save the last episode you left from, well NOPE so it adds on to the stress of having to type in the show name and navigate to the last season and episode I paused at.

I’ve closed the app a million times, restarted my phone, updated the app it’s latest version and turned my tv on and off and I can’t seem to get it to play the subtitles. Whenever it does, they’re delayed or in Spanish. Why have the option if not going to work. Also, when I leave the app to go into the another, it won’t load so I end up having to completely close the app out and open it again. It doesn’t keep track of what episode I’m on so I have to guess.

I guess if they announce Diners Drive Ins and Dives is being taken off for not being watched, that’ll be a clue for how this merger is really going.

Didn’t address the issue (having to manually turn subtitles on every single time I open the app on TV/computer/phone) in the slightest bit and totally ignored my other comment.

The show just remains frozen on the screen. You have to rewind and play every single time. I’ve called into Max to notify them of this, and all they tell me is they’re still working out bugs.

Even when I get something to play I can’t even pause it. Captions may or may not appear even when selected.   The watching selection is expanding rapidly but it’s truly low quality watching for a company with the reputation of HBO. The library is so dense with no real description of any selection. The details about shows used to include original air dates, actors, directors, producers, writers. Now you’re lucky if you can even get a title from the details provided.

There’s no easy way of marking an episode as “viewed” either so the app keeps telling us there are New Episodes available. THERE ARE NO NEW EPISODES!! The new format with the flashy new name is just awful at keeping up.  What genius thought changing everything was a good idea? So many completely FREE apps work so much better than this.

Instead I get categories like “trending now” or “recently added” but they are only showing approx 10 titles each…and pretty much the same 10 titles regardless of the algo category.  In the meantime I know there is a lot more new content because the titles being spammed at me are Lifetime movies, reality shows etc; none of which I have a history of watching.

The audio gets out of sync with the video about every 10 minutes - if you stop the video and then restart, it is fixed, but most of the time you then get kicked back to the last ad break, so it takes about 25% longer to watch anything than it should (although the advertisers are probably extremely happy about this!). Also, a green strip keeps appearing at the bottom of the screen - incredibly distracting if the scene is dark, or if you just want your video to look like it‘a supposed to. HBO is a joke and they clearly hate their customers because they have gone backwards in terms of both content and functionality with this “update”.",Don’t bother…

I have to go find the show and then find the episode I’m on, and sometimes when I find the episode I’m on it didn’t save where I left off (ie. I was in the middle of an episode of the middle when I had to leave for an appointment and it restarted the whole episode). This is a bug in the system that needs to be worked on because some people don’t have the patience to keep looking for their shows/episodes. Other than that, I loved it when it was HBO Max and I like the broader selection of shows without having to change apps.",Not saving any of the shows to my continue watching list.

This is a bit of a deal breaker especially if you’re watching a movie or something in the dark. There are 2 very white bright elements distracting from the program or movie.  HBO Max didn’t have this. This is a failure of QA and product sign off and a basic feature of any video application. You can do better.  On a good note, the new combined content is good I guess. I like that HBO is broken off into its own channel as is the rest of the content. I’m nervous what the future will bring since I’m an old school HBO consumer.  I will continue to subscribe because the HBO content is stellar, but I think while some bugs are going to be ironed out, there’s no reason to have the full screen issue.

Click once and the timeline appears on screen, and then click again to actually skip ahead or back. Small thing, but somehow really irritating. Every other app is just one-click and responsive.  The design of the app feels clunkier, heavy, and not as thoughtfully designed as the previous HBO Max app. For example, the welcome screen where you choose a profile is ugly / why are the profile pictures so massive? (I’m in graphic design, I can’t help but notice this). I wish they just changed the app name versus forcing you to re-download a new app that is worse in aesthetics and function.","Uglier, Glitchy"

Several shows in my continue watching are stuck in episodes that I have already seen. But won’t update to the new part of the show I’m in.

Now it’s MAX, not quite the same or as good in all of those areas… especially some of the functions, like it’s difficult to Restart an episode (little bitty area you gotta touch just right) and the option is not automatically offered when you return to a show.

Constantly losing connection to the screen and has to reconnect and reload…goes for seconds or minutes and then happens again.

If I’m rewatching a series that I enjoy, instead of playing the next episode from the start, it plays from last played. So, If I stopped watching at the credits, it starts at that point and not at the beginning of the next episode. I tried removing watch history, but that doesn’t seem to be available.

I’d like to rewind all the way, but the scrolling instead of spinning is meticulous- if you don’t brush completely horizontally then it won’t work- and slow. AND the “play next episode button” pops up immediately so when you pause to rewind (since you *need* to on this app) it’ll immediately play the next episode.

When I finally got the app downloaded on his TV, as soon as I first opened the app it asked for a password. For what account??? We put in 5 different passwords including the actual account password, his TV account password and other ones as well.

The transitions between top bar menu items and programming is atrocious.  For the love of my eyesight please introduce a fade in and out transition - not a sudden pop in and out.  Also, there is something terribly off with the frame rate while watching content on the app, after scanning through time.  It appears to almost play too slowly or quickly depending on if you have moved forward or backwards.  This doesn’t happen all of the time, but once is enough to make you feel slightly ill.  Lastly, why are categories of content so hard to locate?  It’s as if you don’t want your customers to be able to find content they would like.  The HBO and discovery apps both did better jobs of this.

The music volume compared to voice volume is quite dramatic I often have to adjust the volume to due the music being exceptionally louder than voice volume. Also it will constantly start serial many episodes back from where I left off. I only use the app on my phone so it should remember my viewing history.

The biggest issue is a synching problem with audio and video. The video drags and the audio continues at the proper rate. This has happened with two series so far. The previous HBOMAX had issues, but not as many as I have found here.

So just now instead  of being able to browse  A-Z, I had to search through every single  genre, where  some of movies appeared in multiple genres.

Doesn’t track the episodes you’ve watched or where you left off. The continued watching section does not update so you have to search for what you were watching to pick up where you left off and hopefully you remember what episode you were on. What you’re watching will randomly restart and when it does it then doesn’t allow you to fast forward to get where you were so you have to close the app entirely to restart.

I also don't like that movies with sub and dub are now two separate movies instead of being able to just switch the audio makes the whole thing unnecessarily difficult And why have to download a whole different app why not just update the app that was already in use?",Its just ehh

For some reason, now the clock and battery display doesn’t turn off automatically and is very distracting.

I have several TVs and I might watch something on 3 different floors in my house and yet when I log back in I don’t have the show available to pick up where I left off and if it is it shows me the first episode in the series.. just so many wasted clicks and time. Please fix!!! Netflix is a good model to follow.. it’s 2023 why is this app still working like it’s 20 years old? Where is all the old HBO content? HBO had a whole library of movies they made in the 80s and 90s and yet it’s never made it on the platform.

3,2023-07-20 16:07:54,"A new Max iPhone app upgrade came out today, and problems I’ve raised with their agents remain broken.  It’s been more than a month since notifying staff of episode numbers being wrong for the 2022 seasons of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel and Real Time with Bill Maher.   Somehow it causes the Nov and Dec episodes of Real Sports to be flat-out missing and unavailable.   More critically for iPhone users who rely on an unlimited 5G cellular plan and Apple’s Lightning to Digital AV adapter (to watch as a group on a larger screen) the bug introduced in the previous Max upgrade is unfixed.   A downloaded show cannot be viewed, only audio comes through.  Streaming a show does display to the larger screen, but one can of course experience buffering at times when the 5G service is at peak demand or otherwise overloaded.    I was told all these problems were passed into developers but I now doubt that.  MAX has good stuff but the customer service is questionable.",New app still with critical iPhone flaw & more

I’ve turned off my phone, deleted the app, reinstalled it, logged in and out, but I still can’t turn it off. The worst part is I never even turned audio descriptions on in the first place - the app updated on its own and now it’s stuck like this.

Also, The new interface is much harder to navigate. I pull up the app on my Roku several times a day look thru the terrible new shows, get frustrated with all the garbage content, then go to a different app to find something to watch.

The only complaint I would have is a lot of the proprietary content Max creates is in the woke genre. Not as much for mass audiences or even the critically acclaimed arena; just not my cup of tea. Although, the HBO brand has always been that way, so I’m not shocked.

I was going back and forth from HBO to Discovery and now it’s all in one. That’s a plus. Overall, I can’t complain. It’s nice to kinda have everything in one app. The UI could be better but for an app that just launched, I love it. I’ll use it everyday just like I have been with HBO.

However, I wish there were more options with animation-specifically Max should spend less of its money on shows like Velma and more on stories warrant a show. Original animated shows that are just reboots of beloved classics perhaps? I would also prefer more anime options but I know it’s not on Max to provide that…  I was surprised that we could pick a character for a profile. It seems like Mac is trying to copy Disney Plus.

The way this app takes over like that with no simple way to go back, is absurd. And don’t click back, or it’ll just bring you to the main generic home screen on the app. Terrible experience. I’m specifically talking about the Apple TV app (can’t review on the Apple TV), but the point stands. This app stinks, and it’s inferior to the old HBO Max app.",Forced to use an inferior app.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve deleted the app and redownloaded to try to get it to work better or just to turn off certain things. The last app did not have these problems. What did y’all do?!

1,2023-08-29 05:05:44,"why does MAX recommend and push that I watch a slew of reality tv? From my watch history the APP should know what I am interested in seeing. it s all narrative story telling and actual documentaries.

I don’t watch this content. Stop putting it in front of me. The amount of content I will never watch on my main feed almost makes the app unusable.  Are you serious MAX?  I gave real feed back. And you responded with an automated reply? Telling me to provide feedback? Either give with a legitimate response or don’t respond and all. It’s fine not to respond.

One problem is that every once in a while yor watching a show and it has a swirling circle then it rewinds gose back to where it was and rewinds again that gose on forever if you don’t fix it by winding it forward so that’s all so just a little laggy but I still completely advise that you get it,Good.

It’s NOT my fault pricing and tiers were changed so I believe that I should STILL be able to watch 4K content until my yearly subscription is up. I really hope to hear back because it’s not very good for your ‘new look’. I was expecting better from this new app but I’m just frustrated and mad to be completely honest!

Pretty sad that I have to do a google search to get the list of shows added that month because they are too lazy to provide it in-app.  The old app also had a just added by category. Also eliminated.  Also lost downsized were the searchable genre categories and being able to click on the title for the row to bring up the entire listing in that category. Now you are stuck scrolling to the right and it has just a few in that category.  So much harder to find a movie to watch that I spend less time on this app and more time on prime.

I can’t fast forward a show or rewind without having to rewatch an ad if there is an add break at that moment in the show or movie. This is ridiculous.

Why make everyone migrate to a new app and a new website? Why undo all the good changes HBO and HBO max have made? This is blatant greed and ignorance from corporate. HBO was one of the few remaining companies that produces good content and they’re going to throw that all away to add cheaper reality TV no one wants because it’s cheaper and makes the CEO more money? Greedy selfish people. And then to remove writer credits and make a half hearted apology that doesn’t even really accept fault? I am two seconds away from canceling my subscription.

Prime Video is blue. This app is as generic as Discovery’s bland reality TV programming. It’s less user friendly than HBO. And it’s cluttered with extra programming.   With prestige shows like Barry and Succession ending, I fear for the future of HBO as a place for must-see programming. The buzz about The Idol being re-written to appeal to more viewers doesn’t sound great. And Discovery runs shows for 8 million seasons. Will that happens with dramas on HBO now too?

I can no longer browse content the way I could before. It’s a huge step backward and I’m very angry about it.

Never had this problem before but it’s pretty annoying, and disrupts the experience to the point of questioning is this subscription still worth it. Hope it improves, but currently kind of a shame.",The last app was better 🙃

It’s extremely buggy, crashes frequently, and I am logged out across my various devices on a daily basis. I’m not sure if this is intentional on their part as a way to prevent account sharing, but it is incredibly annoying and inconvenient, and I don’t know if I the annoyance is worth my continued subscription. I’ll give it some time but I never experienced the level of issues with the old HBO Max app, so it’s surprising they released such a regression in user experience.",Feels beta

The previews and description of tv show episodes are so tiny they are hard to see with my 20/20 vision.

This is really annoying to me because it is an inconvenience and I don’t want to sound like a Karen but it’s annoying!

The current version of MAX has some bugs that need to be addressed. Watching a series on TV, the normal behavior isn’t there. For instance; watching The Last of Us (or anything else), when the episode is near the end, it should allow one to watch the next episode without issue. But it doesn’t. Also, using the Apple TV (4K) remote, and clicking the upper left button, doesn’t go back one step. Instead, one HAS to return to the Apple TV *UP NEXT menu to see additional episodes.

2,2023-06-11 14:41:54,"Why does HBO continue to employ inferior staff? I suspect we will never know. I just wish they would send them away and employ a team that could make an app that is even close to the many other streaming apps available. We know the technology is available, so why can’t a behemoth company like HBO use it? I’d be open to government assistance for the inferiors, but they should not be allowed around computers ever again.","Better than their previous app, but not by much"

Shows are not showing under continuously watching, episodes don’t start over if you are rewatching a series, and the app doesn’t keep track of what you watched, so you have to go through all the episodes just to get to the episode you wanted to pick up on. Do better. You forced us to change apps, because of this “name change”. No one asked for this. Fix your streaming service.",Same as the other reviews

I played around with it a bit and even if I just finished something and refresh the page it will not update my progress. It’ll probably get better but unimpressive start.",Pretty Buggy so Far…

If MAX didn’t have my favorite shows, I would consider canceling the subscription.  Bring back the continue watching!!!!!",RIP Continue watching

1,2023-05-26 19:27:10,1 star for the poor transition. I’ve had HBO max for a couple years now and have been happy with the content and service. Even while traveling long term this worked great. With the change to MAX… no longer available in my region. So I’ve paid for a year of content and will miss out on almost 6 months of service. HBO was heavily advertised locally and now it seems to be removed from the region entirely.   Do I get a refund…,Excited for the new content and completely disappointed in the changes.

But here you go even after Zaslav’s promise, that it would be a better experience, it actually comes out even worse! What a piece of garbage and we’re expected actually to pay MORE for this? Let’s talk about all the features that are missing from this.  No integration with Apple TV and its Up Next feature No native video player No Picture in Picture Frame rate issues Dynamic range issues Can’t scrub a video worth a crap with Siri Remote   Since my current subscription ends next month, I will probably go for a month and when there’s something worth watching, probably when the second season of the Last of Us premieres.

1,2023-05-23 06:13:26,"As stated, there are several features that used to function perfectly fine in the former “HBO Max” app. The two features I’m talking about in particular are:  - Match Content (Dynamic Range/Frame Rate) - Apple TV app synchronization   Match Content is an important feature that allows the Apple TV to change the dynamic range (SDR/HDR/HDR10+/Dolby Vision) and frame rate (generally 24fps for movies and tv shows). Many people want the content to display in its proper dynamic range and frame rate.  Apple TV app integration allows you to view shows and movies that you’re watching in the “Up Next” section and continue watching them which would open the Max app and take you to the video.   Overall, while I like that there’s more UHD content in Max than there was with HBO Max, the app itself is a major downgrade.",Many Apple TV app features are missing

It doesn’t matter if it’s my TV, phone, or game consoles (PlayStation/Xbox). It does it on all of them. I never had any issues like this before and it’s frustrating. I figured these bugs would be fixed by now but it’s still aggravating. Also in agreement with others, the setup and the loss of features is disappointing. The app is not better as promoted; its worse.",Log Out Issues!
5,2023-06-10 19:04:46,AMAZING CATEGORIES there’s allot of good movies and it’s very organize nice opening etc. it’s a good way to find what you need to watch and how to watch has a LOT of languages to choose from the subtitles are not in the way nor to big or small it’s probably the most useful streaming app in my opinion. ;)))),YES YES YES MAXX
1,2023-06-22 03:04:06,"Might be the worst streaming app I’ve ever seen. Old HBOMax was good. Literally told me my password didn’t meet the requirements (was too short), but it was the saved HBOMax password that they told me to use. Keeps making me re download it, crashes, didn’t save more than half of my continue watching or saved Queue. It’s bad enough that as soon as we finish the show we’ve been watching, we will probably delete it amd unsubscribe.",Should have tested before they released

I understand this is a total first world problem, but I’m spending money every month on the app that also recently started having ads.. I love that discovery and HBO came together to make the ultimate streaming app, but unfortunately there are still some kinks, all of this does discourage me from continuing to use the service",The app lags
5,2023-10-15 02:20:42,As if I didn’t have enough subscriptions! I was worried about if I would have to pay for another platform to screen the Discovery of Witches and here we are! They have added it onto Max and I couldn’t be happier! 🥹,No way!

The app has a hard time remembering exactly where you stopped playing a show when you return, a frustrating step backward.

Now, despite being ridiculous monthly fees through my cable provider, I cannot access the app anywhere.",Crappy Transition
1,2023-05-24 01:06:30,Very disappointed with the new TVOS app that has been released. The lack of Apple’s native video player is one of many problems including the app not syncing with Up Next and not abiding by system wide settings with closed caption. Huge disappointment.   Equally disappointing is that we were misled to believe that all Discovery+ shows would be added to this platform and that does not appear to be the case with many shows missing.,Break in functionality
1,2023-11-04 03:16:09,"I primarily stream HBO from my phone to Sony Android’s built in chromeCast. Previous iterations of the HBO app worked fine; however, now with the new Max app, when starting a video, the volume defaults to max on the tv. so I have to play the game of lowering the volume fast enough before it wakes up my entire household, or trying to pause it before it makes a noise so that I can lower the volume.

4,2023-09-21 01:12:37,It should have different languages for series. For example in Cartoon Network there’s not a single cartoon in another language. I don’t know if there’s a specific reason for that but I would love to watch it in Spanish for example. But overall it’s good.,Different languages

Of course, you can avoid these limits of you pay even more on top of their already high subscription fees.   I’m not doing that. I canceled my account instead.

1,2023-05-23 23:54:24,The HBO max app which has worked fine for years was force upgraded and this new app forced me to not only log in again but change my password and then had streaming issues. Absolute hot garbage. i don’t know how many different App HBO needs to push out. This is like #4 since they’ve started a streaming service. Here’s a tip HBO: Don’t release Apps until they are well tested and don’t make the user experience of the new App horrible.,Hot Garbage
4,2023-10-24 13:00:41,I love hbo max. I do wish they recommended things that are alike to movies and shows I watch daily on here; instead of a computer generated of what the majority of  users watch. But all in all would highly recommend.,How I feel about the app

This App is a steaming pile of garbage, clunky, repetitive, difficult to find things, SLOW, poorly designed. And to top it off they removed the marquee HBO name and decided to use the crappy MAX which makes everybody think of Skin-O-Max. Good move!!!!!  Warner Brothers screwed up big time.",Garbage

If you search for the show it still doesn’t show where you were.   I’ve tried the work around and they don’t work or they work. And frankly no one should be doing a work around.

1,2023-05-25 02:24:26,HBO Max application was bad. This new one is even worse. With all the money that Warner brothers make.

2,2023-06-25 10:00:06,Max does this confusingly stupid thing where if I click on an episode of something I’ve watched before it starts me at the place I last watched… which was the credits…. So it plays the same “next episode” bar at the bottom and starts the next episode…. HBO apparently contributed the logic to the video playback. Absolutely dumb.,Silly User Design Changes
2,2023-06-20 04:08:13,HBO MAX worked great- minor issues but they were very far and few between that it was fine. Then they changed to just MAX and it’s a nightmare!!

1,2023-06-19 15:01:56,"HBO Max was fine, typical streaming app, no issues.  I’m fine with the rebrand, but you can rebrand without creating a whole new app.  So now i have to download a new app on every device instead of simply updating like every other company does their rebranding.  AND, this is a big one, the new MAX app (easily confused with cinemax, but that’s probably their intent) requires me to login EVERY TIME I OPEN THE APP.","New app for no good reason, no i have to login every time"

1,2023-05-25 02:34:23,I loved HBO max I was okay with it changing names I wasn’t exactly stoked considering that the name “Max” is the most generic name ever but hey whatever. Little did I know that I’d have to download an entirely new app. The blue color is WAYYY overdone like every single steaming service is blue now the purple was so fresh and beautiful now I guess the generic name “Max” fits with the generic blue color.

1,2023-05-24 12:21:58,"With the change to Max from HBO Max, the amount of ads I’ve gotten has skyrocketed.

It makes me much less likely to enjoy or recommend this service to others.",Went from minimal ads to way too many

1,2023-08-17 01:06:54,The MAX app has been a disaster since it launched. A lot of the content included have audio syncing issues with the video on both the mobile and Roku devices.

This app needs some serious work.,This app is clunky

5,2023-06-14 16:54:42,I like the HBO/Cinemax app now called Max. But I feel that they are pushing the pride agenda too much. A persons sexual orientation and preference is a personal thing. It’s out there to much. I dont care what you are or pretend to be or think you are.,Pushing it a to much.
4,2023-07-07 14:54:30,For starters HBO Max had a great. variety of TV shows and it’s also really easy to find TV shows you want to watch on HBO Max.

2,2023-06-10 21:54:08,The only plus that comes with Max compared to HBO is that max has a “my list” to save your favorite shows. Max rarely ever saves your place in the episodes. “Continue watching” is so buggy!

1,2023-06-09 00:11:32,Max added some good new content but the new apps have issues. Continue Watching either doesn’t advance shows to the next episode or it drops shows completely. Lost some nice features in Recently Added and Leaving Soon. The new app has some version of Just Added which doesn’t show the most recently added content. Comments apply to Roku app as well.,Awful Max apps
5,2023-05-31 00:33:32,The quality of the shows and content simply are a league above the rest. Max just transitioned from the older platform so there a few hiccups here and there but for me so mad it’s a seamless transition and it’s amazing,Max Supremecy

2,2023-05-29 03:13:20,Eh not really sure what they were trying to do but now the new Max doesn’t give notifications for new episodes for series you have added (HBO Max always updated on new episodes saved to your list).

1,2023-05-26 19:29:02,The creation of the new app is so stupid. If you’re going to rebrand why not just change the existing app instead of making everyone download a new app that’s the same?! Also ever since the change I have no “continue watching”. Every time I open the app I have to search my show and fast forward because my history is not saved.,Rebrand messed it all up!
5,2023-05-24 19:55:02,I was wondering why HBO max app was so hard to navigate and laggy. It’s because y’all were working on this !! It’s so much easier to find new stuff and the selection is a scroll away . Blessed!,Awesome!!

Get it together hbo. I work all day and want to watch tv. But no, I have to spend 20+ minutes downloading new apps and signing in to 9 accounts and switching between tv and internet and apps. Holy cow it’s annoying",Again? Another new app?
5,2023-06-04 15:09:03,It’s has all my favorite things but the only thing it’s missing is probably SpongeBob because kids will watch that for hours…,Max is great
1,2023-06-06 08:59:31,So I loved the old app even though it would crash now and then but this app is horrible. Any show I try to watch says “unexpected error loading/playing this content” and then won’t play it or it will play it and that error message stays on the screen. My app is up to date. iPhone XR is compatible and it’s garbage. About to cancel my subscription,Loved the old App this one is trash

1,2023-05-29 04:06:39,"This new app is almost the same as the old app but excludes multiple useful features like syncing with the AppleTV app.  Beyond this, I am now paying more for less content. They removed a number of originals I enjoyed. And canceled full-finished projects which were about to release. I am also furious by the way this company treats their creators and supports abusive actors.  Be cautious…",WBD isn’t what you think…

Very frustrating bc even when I cut it off & back on it still picks up from before the commercials even if I already watched them through. I know they gotta work out the kinks but it’s been days of this now,Issues
3,2023-05-26 22:07:28,I’ve seen a lot of reviews about how the new update is really bad but it’s honestly not even that different other than the name and the fact that there are now more shows. I honestly do not understand why people are so upset.,People are being dramatic.
3,2023-05-26 21:34:49,HBO Max worked just fine but then we i had to download max there was a connection issues where it would work for 15-20 minutes and then start loading then tell me that the connection is not available,Why max?

2,2023-05-25 21:36:54,"As other said, doesn’t play well with Apple TV.  But mainly, the new MAX app is a poorly organized mess.  The HBOMax app was easy to search in and dive deep into content not being pushed.  This one is convoluted, perhaps by design.

1,2023-05-24 08:49:24,Congrats you successfully downgraded your product. There was no reason to do this. The new platform is ugly glitchy and has less features than the original app. It’s more annoying to navigate and it just looks aesthetically bad. This goes for the phone and PlayStation app. Fire whoever thought this new platform was a good idea cuz you just spent millions making your product worse,Awful

Just don’t give them your money, you’ll regret it.",Waste of a streaming service
3,2023-09-05 00:05:59,"I never watched Discovery before.  They should have kept all the Discovery programs in their own streaming service instead of ruining and watering down HBO MAX.

2,2023-06-24 21:34:47,This app has been very unstable. While watching shows that would have had commercial breaks it will get stuck in a loop between segments requiring the user fast forwards manually. It freezes and crashes requiring restarting. Have experienced this on both iPad and TV.,Freezes often
3,2023-06-14 02:57:04,Most things work appropriately on the app. The issue I keep having is that it won’t save the progress on the shows I’m watching so I’m repeatedly having to search for the show I’m currently watching and duffle through the episodes.,App issues

1,2023-06-10 11:54:48,When I opened up an app there was some statement about my subscription not being about to be used so I canceled it and renewed it to start after the current one ends. They charged me twice. The app has also been super glitchy for me. I hate the ads. I’ve basically paid $20 for a glitchy app. I am awaiting a refund for the second charge.,Glitch caused me to be charged twice.
5,2023-05-28 18:00:13,Love the app. Have always had HBO for years and subsequently HBO Max so I’m thrilled to now have Discovery shows as per of my choices! So many new shows I’ve never seen before that now I’m hooked,Love the new MAX!

1,2023-09-11 06:18:25,This has been the most glitchy app from hbo. I can’t get into the seasons or episodes of a show without the app crashing. I would have thought after 4 versions of hbo apps they would have a handle on things in the app world. Get with the times and have a working app. I’m probably not going to renew my subscription because of this.,Worst version of this app
1,2023-08-29 01:59:41,Worst app I’ve seen. Has kicked me out while watching a show. When I try an sign back in I have to several times. Keeps saying can not verify subscription. Download shows then app won’t pull up when you have no service what’s point in downloading. Just updated the app and downloads are now gone. If this wasn’t included in my AT&T plan I’d want a refund.,Bad

4,2023-08-05 03:04:02,I really want to like this app. It’s a good app. Great shows and movies from great companies. The problem with this app is that the people at the top are idiots.

2,2023-06-26 01:06:23,This app doesn’t have the frustrating issue where a previously watched episode or show gets stuck on the splash logo.   It does seem to have issues with closed captioning. I have to select it every time I start a new movie or episode. It is rather annoying.   This is a huge issue since it impacts peoples with disabilities. Minus 2 stars for this.   This app could be 5 stars. Except for one other thing - the audio seems to fluctuate before a new episode. Why have previews or “previously on…” if one can’t hear them? I have stereo HomePods. Could this be the issue?,Fix closed captioning

3,2023-06-10 05:11:45,The new set up seems glitchy or something. Makes it really frustrating to cast the shows/movies to your smart tv. Controls after it’s been casted are missing or glitching or just not popping up.,Difficult on phone for casting

1,2023-06-02 03:14:54,You turned hbo max from an app that worked to max absolute garbage is what it must be short for. Picture quality is horrendous now the continue watching is just gone and now all it does it buffer. I had no problems with the old purple hbo max then you threw it in a blender gave it new paint and said it’s perfect.,Horrible

1,2023-05-27 02:12:56,"I don’t understand why they had to make a whole new app for this. HBO Max was just fine but to do all this to make it just “MAX” seems silly and pointless.

2,2023-05-24 03:50:02,No need to differentiate from the hbo max app to the point where we lose Usability. The fact that you have to scroll all the way back up to get to different categories is just outdated app design. Stick with what works.,The top menu bar is a mistake
5,2023-05-24 01:23:29,Love HBO. Has some of the best shows of any platform. The app works great as well. My only complaint with Max is that they got rid of the iconic purple!!! Bring back the purple!,Blue!?

1,2023-05-23 15:01:26,I immediately deleted the app and reverted back to HBO Max. While scrolling the interface it constantly jumps back to the top of the screen not to mention not supporting the “up next” feature of the Apple entertainment ecosystem. You couldn’t use the base programming of HBO max for your new app? For reals? I’d give this zero stars if possible. Fail.,Apple TV app disaster

1,2023-06-02 04:13:59,I’m not sure why HBO replaced HBO Max with Max.

1,2023-05-24 07:07:23,There is absolutely no reason I had to download a new app just for a style change. You can change the way an app looks without completely turning it into a skeleton just to copy paste the design onto a new “fresh” rebranded one. Nonsense.,Completely unnecessary
1,2023-05-24 05:44:16,One reason I liked this app above all other streaming services was the ability to set my own profile picture now it’s just like any other all. They downgraded by doing this update.,Profile pictures
1,2023-05-24 05:44:07,Why force us all to download a new app for no reason? All you did was make everything look worse than it did before. Couldn’t you have done that by just updating the old app?,An absolutely pointless new app

1,2023-05-29 21:01:07,"Changing HBO MAX to Max was awful. The name sounds bland and the blue color scheme just looks terrible. Why fix something that’s not broken? It’s just so infuriating.

I hope the morons at Discovery don’t ruin HBO, but polluting the HBO content stream with this garbage is a dark harbinger.   Also, this CREATORS tag is not helpful and actually malicious in intent. Use that for reality crap, but for films—their respective guilds have pretty rigid guidelines for credits, so maybe just use those.   And pay your writers.","Love Hbo, hate Max"

1,2023-06-03 07:04:00,Once HBO switched to the max app it is now nearly impossible to use and god forbid you try and do anything other than let it decide for you what you want to watch and at what point In the show or season you should watch,Max app crap app

1,2023-05-26 02:41:41,The whole reason I had HBO was mad to watch movies and shows over FaceTime with my girlfriend. We are long distance and HBO max gave us a way we can watch stuff together and now that’s not possible I think I might cancel just because of that.,No SharePlay

4,2023-05-29 02:52:19,"Wish i could scroll through titles as i write this then i could list the shows that have saved my life, quality and quantity, and been fun all the while. However this review window just popped up so doing what i can in the moment.  They used to call TV the “Boob Tube” while overlooking its impact on a young priviledged generations’ witnessing war atrocities and asking questions and taking action as a result as well as shows that were cathartic for the social changes that without art to help integrate would have been even more overwhelming than they already were.  And I think the plethora and quality of shows these days in general is astounding and likely taken for granted as we humans tend to do; there are teams of writers these day more so than in the past and perhaps larger teams, more diversity and so much more integrated with knowledge in general such as psychology and politics and ecology etc.  “My List” feature nice as is option to download.  I haven’t used Netflix in a long time so can’t review a comparison and Showtime…well again I don’t recall programs there vs here off the top of my head.  Too bad all these providers can’t share content more readily as while it is great to escape and even conversely or concurrently get deeper into life and relationships etc. through art that also means my brain is not paying so much attention to the service through which i am watching it so no details stored in my old brain to list here.  Also it is somewhat socially separating to have access only to shows in one streaming service vs another.  Another improvement would be to have more social access, discussions about the movies and potentially even watch parties where we all watch one at the same time and discuss afterwards.",Therapeutic and far more sane often than the so called real-world

3,2023-06-14 23:08:53,"I use an Apple TV to watch Max, and the first issue I noticed with the new Max app (after changing from HBO Max) is that the player has been completely changed. Quick rewind/fast forward has been removed. With the old HBO Max app, I could simply click the left/right sides of the remote during playback to quickly move backward or forward. Now with the new Max app, I can only do quick rewinds/forwards by pausing first. This issue is compounded by the fact that resuming playback after pausing always jumps the video forward by a few seconds, so I can never actually resume the video exactly where I left off, and I can never skip to exactly where intended. The main reason I usually like to do a quick rewind is to listen again to something I missed, but when the video jumps forward upon resuming playback, I still end up missing what I'm trying to listen to, which is needlessly frustrating. The issue with the video jumping too far forward also happens when skipping intros. Whenever I hit the option to skip an intro or an ad, the beginning of the episode is cut off as it skips forward too far. This becomes very obvious with fast paced shows that have dialogue the moment the episode starts, as I usually end up missing the first half of a sentence of dialogue after skipping an intro. So then I end up pausing, doing a quick rewind, and then being forced to watch part of the ad and/or intro just so I can actually see the beginning of an episode. The player is just so much clunkier than it needs to be now, especially considering the player was perfect the way it was in the original HBO Max app. Developers, if you're reading this, please consider fixing this in a future update by reverting to the original player from the HBO Max app.",Please bring back the original player controls

3,2023-05-26 05:46:43,"Who is the marketing genius? That thought people weren’t gonna confuse this with Cinemax? The  channel that HBO has been in competition with since premium cable was invented. I hate the blue I loved the purple I understand whoever made the choice to change it to blue doesn’t like purple and that’s why they did it. They did not think of your consumer base when they did that. if someone is not being fired over this change, they really need to be but I’m sure they’re getting fat raises and bonuses because of it because in house you’re thinking this was a good launch. there was zero reason to make people download another app. My TV could not figure out how to do it. I downloaded the app about six times before it actually took and that’s not an old TV that’s a new TV so it shouldn’t of had any trouble and after I download it, it would get confused on which apt actually open, even when I would click the Max app, which makes no sense since they’re supposedly two different apps.   Add to the fact that nothing is sorted the same way either so I can’t find anything now which is also irritating. Unless it was actually in my list I got no idea how you guys are sorting things. On HBO max everything was broken down really nicely into different categories and now it’s just all lumped together and I hate that. Again unless you guys have merged with Cinemax which I couldn’t find any news on there was zero reason not to just call this HBO. Drop everything else, drop the go, drop the now, drop the whatever and just call it HBO. Why is that so difficult we don’t need plus we don’t need add we don’t need any of that discovery or whatever just call it HBO and let that be the end of it even if you’ve merged with whatever but since you are not merging with Cinemax, there was no reason to call it Max.  With all that said, if you need a new person to take over whomever made this decision I am your girl. I got qualifications and got degrees with over 30 years work experience. I got whatever you need and you can pay me 75% whatever you paid the person that made the decision to call this Max and I’ll be fine with it. I don’t even need a bonus but I’ll take it and I guarantee you I can make it a better app than anybody who decided to call this Max and confuse people thinking it’s Cinemax.",Oh this isn’t Cinemax aka Skinemax?

5,2023-09-14 02:33:52,"You know the radio hasn’t heard a not for miles right.   The hosts are at home asleep   But with your numb clamming fingers stuck to that steering wheel, you don’t care.  You’re too focused on getting out.   It's hard to believe it’s been 3 hours since you’ve seen them  You miss them, but that doesn’t seem to bother you  All that matters is getting there, seeing them.   Then maybe you’ll feel it again  A click, a sound on the radio, a sign of life.   You recognize the song but can’t remember the words.   A melody, flows in the shape of sadness, and the feeling of cold.   It reminds you of something  A thought that cost you a freethought for the rest of your life.  You waited for this moment  It came, and it went, and you feel exactly the same way you’ve felt for 3 days  And now you’re left with my thoughts again.   The memory doesn’t fade  You can feel their skin  It was awfully dark to tell, wasn’t it  That’s the last time you felt it.  What a way to start your adult life.  Lose at your own hands is a uniquely terrible thing.  But when it’s past, it’s past   You have to move on.   After all its been 3 weeks and you’re still gripping that steering wheel   Nomatter how numb your fingers are.  When they left, you felt nothing.  And when they came back, you felt worse.  That’s why you did it  You waited for this  You weren’t sure it was the right time, but.  You had to do it.  You loved her  I have nothing to do with this  I have nothing in common with you, nor do I wish to.   I am merely the messenger of your intrusive thoughts.  The executioner of rash decisions  Thats me, in your head  I offer to all, but you accepted.  You acted on it.  And you don't know when you’ll be able to see it.  3 months, wanting a way out of the situation  Out of your mind   That’s why you took a drive.   Static, because you’ve been driving for 3 years now,  And your glassy eyes can’t see your knuckles have gone white  And your ringing ears can’t hear me anymore.   The radio has been static for a while now, but  You’re still humming that tune you heard 3 days ago  They were there with you  You’re dry lips crack and bleed when you smile.  You can feel them now  Sweet static clawing at your cheeks  But your dry eyes, and your cracked lips can barely feel the tears falling  A sunrise on a new day, a cloud atop a hill  You can see it   In your rear view mirror  A mirage of a better decision  Would you believe it if you saw it?  Would you want to?  You know what you did.  But refuse to accept it  A world that gave them to you  And took them away  It doesn’t matter   They will move on.  They will forgive you   But you took the air for them to say that   Great things come for those who wait  For the static, the fog, the ringing to stop  After all without the rain, the flowers still come  You’re 3 minutes away now   And you can finally open your eyes  But adventures never really end do they?  Someone has to carry on the story.",My story

5,2023-06-27 16:34:53,"I recently had the pleasure of exploring the streaming service Max, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in many ways. With its vast library of movies and TV shows, Max truly offers a delightful entertainment experience. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing me to effortlessly discover new content and enjoy my favorite shows.  One aspect that particularly impressed me was the quality of the streaming. The video and audio were both crystal clear, ensuring an immersive viewing experience. Furthermore, Max's recommendation algorithm seemed to understand my preferences well, suggesting a variety of titles that matched my interests perfectly.  Additionally, Max offers a great selection of original content. From gripping dramas to hilarious comedies, there's something for everyone. I found myself binge-watching several of their original series, thoroughly enjoying the captivating storytelling and brilliant performances.  While the recent name change to Max may have caught some users off guard, I believe it is a testament to the company's commitment to rebranding and adapting to the evolving market. After all, a name doesn't define the quality of the service it represents. Max remains a top-notch streaming platform, and I look forward to continued enjoyment of its exceptional content.  Mean Review: Let me start by saying that the recent name change to Max for this streaming service was absolutely dumb. Seriously, who came up with that? It's like they just picked a random three-letter word out of a hat and decided to roll with it. It's neither catchy nor memorable, and it certainly doesn't reflect the excitement and innovation one would expect from a streaming platform.  But let's move past the name and focus on the service itself. Frankly, I found Max to be rather underwhelming. The library of content is limited compared to other streaming platforms, and the user interface feels clunky and outdated. It's a struggle to find anything worth watching, and the recommendation algorithm seems to be completely off the mark.  Even worse, the streaming quality is often subpar, with frequent buffering and poor video resolution. It's frustrating to invest time and money into a service only to have it constantly interrupted by technical issues. It's as if Max doesn't prioritize providing a smooth and seamless viewing experience for its users.  To add insult to injury, the original content on Max is mostly lackluster. The shows and movies I encountered were uninteresting and failed to captivate my attention. It's a shame because other streaming platforms have raised the bar with their compelling originals, but Max seems to fall flat in this regard.  In conclusion, the name change to Max was just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the disappointments I experienced with this streaming service. With its limited content, poor user interface, and lackluster original productions, Max leaves much to be desired. Save your money and look elsewhere for a more satisfying streaming experience.",Great app stupid name change

4,2023-10-30 22:26:23,"The library of content is wide and generally interesting, although it seems to have overloaded on chintzy reality trash lately, at the expense of HBO’s library and other top-tier titles. What is especially concerning is that the really good drama and comedy series are fewer and further between in recent years. Apple TV+ has taken the mantle for ‘premium TV where every show is worth a watch’ away from HBO, which seems to be increasingly inert.  The video player is fine, but there’s nothing in the non-native interface that justifies itself over the native player. Subtitles sometimes get activated without consent, especially when a video gets windowboxed to suggest a next title, but one returns to the current video for watching the end credits. Circular scrubbing with the Apple TV remote is missing. I also can’t tap (not click) the remote to dismiss the video player controls or see the current end-time of the video. All of these are annoying. Very annoying. Netflix uses the native player and it’s great. This is worse. I don’t understand why HBO/Max doesn’t use the native player, although I’m sure some middle manager is enjoying a bonus somehow.  Being able to skip pre-roll content ads as a no-ads customer is a table stakes feature at this point and one of the things I appreciate when compared to Paramount+, which forces viewing of such ads even for premium/“no ads” subscribers. Don’t ever change that.  If I could change three things, one would be to revert to the native video player as explained above. Second would be to lose the overlay showing rating/content info at the beginning of any title for far too long as playback starts. Either return to an info card as one might see on an HBO broadcast in the past 35+ years, or find some other way to not have it in the way of whatever show or movie has already started.  Last would be to re-enable the download/use of the iPad app for Mac users (or make a native Mac app). While streaming in the browser is ‘fine’, not being able to download titles for offline viewing is seriously shortsighted. Prime Video has an app for Mac users, and downloads are available. Apple TV+ (and any subscriptions via the TV app) does too. The old HBO Max app was enabled and worked great on my Macs. My M2 MacBook Air is my best portable screen and I dislike the notion of ‘taking a iPad too’ just to have this flexibility. I see no reason not to opt-in to Mac use of the app that isn’t traceable to a paranoid, distrustful stance towards paying customers.  It’s an above average service, a okay app with seemingly easily-fixable shortcomings, and there’s nothing I need to go back and forth with customer support about. Fix the deficiencies and this becomes an unqualified top-tier 5-star option.",Mostly fine with a few paper cut issues
1,2023-10-19 04:25:59,Useless!,Downloaded videos do not play
5,2023-08-31 13:18:22,Go fund yourself,Penis
1,2023-09-01 07:01:26,"Go to a site like Metacritic and search on HBO and Max. Unless you want a few reality shows from the Discovery side, there is basically nothing being offered from HBO or Max over the next 6 months. What a drop from the stellar premiere service of old. After selling content to other services, the new CEO wants to make money by only producing cheap content. Sure there are still some old hits hanging out for those who have never seen them, and some decent series were wrapped up, but for the monthly price Max is asking there are MUCh better options. Apple TV has been killing it with new content and Netflix has something for everyone. Even Peacock and Paramount have managed to offer some interesting stuff. Max is not a must have anymore. Get it for a month or two and then move on. It's time to send a message to services who intentionally holdback on new content and ask equivalent payment to those who continue to add new programming to theirs. And to be clear, this is not because of the writers strike which will ultimately affect all services. This was planned and advertised well in advance of that. I have no problem paying a service like Netflix who offers a variety of content even if not all of it appeals to me. Vote with your pocketbooks people or they will continue to take advantage of a brand name that they no longer support or honor. ================================================== UPDATE😃: A feature I did not find until today ups this App's functionality and I wish all other Apps would do this. No matter where you are in the App, by holding down the Select button on a show/movie you would like put in your List, it will automatically put it there. You can also delete in the same manner. Similarly you can also delete content in your Continue Watching area by holding down the Select button. I have tested this on Apple TV plus a Fire Cube and both work although on Fire Cube you must hold down the Select button longer plus to remove you hold down longer than get asked if you want to delete. I can't give this App any more stars until content is more defined in the GUI interface but the above usability is a stellar improvement. ******************************************************************** Seldom does a new app come out without glaring bugs. So far this one seems to be the exception. Voice search on Apple TV and control over Autoplay are welcome features. However, with the addition of Discovery Plus content the app has become overwhelming in size. The category 'Brand Spotlight' is buried several rows down, as other Apps have done, where placing it on the top would be more efficient and practical. The massive amount of categories and large picture icons is time consuming to navigate and only serves to keep eyes in the app rather than help direct consumers to content they would prefer. Unfortunately, MAX has not broken away from all the other apps that have crowded screens that need to be endlessly scrolled to find something to watch. The categories 'For You' and ‘Featured' are more about them trying to steer you to programming they want you to watch. Taking away sidebars in the Home Screen that helped you quickly narrow your search was a huge mistake. The top row of Home, Series, Movies, HBO, New & Notable is so generic that, with the amount of content MAX now has, it just opens up a maze that is cavernous. At some point content providers will have to come to the realization that customers respond better to simplicity than complexity. At first the 'All you can eat' buffet of programming does dazzle consumers but eventually that wears off and they become weary of the struggle to find a good content fit.",HBO/MAX new content slashed to nothing

Where you expecting content related to you current watch? Not here at MAX, we just shove all of our high budget shows and movies right back into your face! I literally watched the newest Shazam and when the movie finished I was hoping to continue on the DC train and instead I got; some terrible show that doesn’t interest me, the Meg, a documentary, and another show. Thanks max.  Adult Swims hub was great for watching a lot of shows I grew up on or just enjoy and instead that’s gone. Have to search for my shows like truffle pig hoping just to find one.

Just a new name and maybe some more hubs added for additional content. I don’t understand the thought process behind creating a whole new app when the previous one was fine.   What irks me the most is the design and confusing layout. One of the main reasons I stopped using Netflix was due to their terrible layout. Even though Netflix has a lot of content I find it hard to ever find anything to watch because navigating their selection is so difficult. The navigation on HBO max was always LEAPS ahead of any other service. I found navigating it very easy to do. However all of the features that I enjoyed on the previous app are just gone now. And Max looks a lot like Netflix now. I really don’t now how I’m going to use this. Unless there is a massive overhaul in design change and navigation soon, I will cancel my subscription. I’d rather risk a virus and pirate the films and tv I want to watch than pay for a service that I won’t and can’t use. Really really disappointed today.",Considering cancelling

4,2023-08-15 14:25:52,"I recently subscribed to the ""Max"" streaming service, and I must say, it has been a pleasant surprise. While it may not be perfect, Max offers a solid streaming experience that is worth considering for any avid movie and TV show enthusiast.  One of the standout features of Max is its extensive library of content. With a vast collection of movies and TV shows from various genres, there is something for everyone. Whether you're into action, romance, comedy, or documentaries, Max has you covered. The platform also boasts a good mix of both popular and lesser-known titles, allowing users to discover hidden gems they might have otherwise missed.  The user interface of Max is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. Browsing through the library is a breeze, thanks to well-organized categories and a robust search function. The platform also provides personalized recommendations based on your viewing history, which helps in discovering new content tailored to your preferences.  One aspect that sets Max apart from other streaming services is its emphasis on curated collections and exclusive content. The ""Max Originals"" section offers a range of high-quality, original productions that are both entertaining and thought-provoking. These exclusive shows and movies add value to the service and make it stand out from the competition.  Another notable feature of Max is its streaming quality. The service offers a reliable and stable streaming experience, with minimal buffering, high-definition, and 4K playback. The video and audio quality are impressive, ensuring an immersive viewing experience.  However, there are a few areas where Max could improve. While the library is extensive, there are still some notable titles missing, which can be disappointing for those looking for specific content. Additionally, the availability of subtitles and language options could be expanded to cater to a more diverse audience.  Overall, Max is a solid streaming service that offers a wide range of content, a user-friendly interface, and excellent streaming quality. With its curated collections and exclusive originals, it manages to stand out in a crowded market. While there is room for improvement, Max is definitely worth considering for anyone seeking a diverse and enjoyable streaming experience.",A Solid Streaming Experience with Max

1,2023-07-09 02:16:04,"It’s been a few weeks into my subscription , at this point I refuse to change subscriptions to another service because I do catch random programming I enjoy …but I got the low tier with commercials , I don’t mind the commercials but the app will cast and play movies at full volume and in Spanish or worse yet Descriptive Audio Spanish , so it’s like I just stole from a bodega and the owner is yelling at me when I try to watch a movie at first …I can fiddle with the settings some to get around the oddity , but the setting to turn the descriptive audio off is removed from the UI …which is also part of the glitch or problem . Whatever it is , it’s almost comedically engineered to frustrate . Customer service is non existent . I’d been contacted once ..my first contact I was given the equivalent of a screen shot from a trouble shooting faq they’d developed . So they did not read my email . The second time they reached out was a customer service form they sent me …because apparently reading my complaint on the app on the App Store or reading my email prior wasn’t possible . It’s annoying and utterly the reason I’ll end my subscription . I’d requested a refund and that’s just not a thing with them . Considering I believe the glitch to be by design . I mean come on , the button to set the language and descriptive audio back was removed , I think the design maybe intentional somewhere …it’s seems logical because of the parallel of how it’s made to give no solution besides playing with the connections and different app and tv combos .

3,2023-06-06 09:21:49,"HBO Max changing to MAX seems like another pointless rebranding.   Sure, if you look up the differences between the two, I’m sure the list would be fairly long, but there are still the same issues HBO Max had.   The only noticeable thing, and this could change, is the app lags less when it launches. While the design was slightly changed, there still isn’t a way to clear a show or movie you started and don’t intend to finish.   There are still issues where an episode that was watched previously, starts again at the end, when “next episode” was clicked. Then you have to navigate back to that episode’s home screen, (which is different from the show’s Home Screen, which is different from the regular Home Screen) and hit the “restart episode” button.   When you click on an episode, it immediately plays, rather than showing the episode’s Home Screen, where you can continue where you left off, or restart the show/movie. So there’s a lot of clicking and then backing up, just to do one thing.   Plus the new “shows like this” button, always gets it the way when trying to navigate to a specific season. They put that in a bad place. Selecting a season should be easier than choosing a different show entirely.  The functionality and navigation is still quite flawed. It looks a little better, but while appearance is nice, I think the priority should have been fixing the navigation issues.   So while I like the app’s show and movie selection, the lack of ease with navigating the app leave a lot to be desired.   I’d rather be able to use it easier, than have it only look slightly better than it did.",Unnecessary update that leaves flaws intact

4,2023-05-23 15:25:41,"As an avid HBO Max user, I was intrigued when I heard about the new Max app. Having used it for a while now, I have mixed feelings about it. Let me share my thoughts on the app from a first-person perspective.  One thing that caught my attention right away is the improved loading speed. The new Max app definitely delivers on that front. It's refreshing to see how quickly the content loads, allowing me to dive into my favorite shows and movies without any delay. Kudos to the developers for this improvement.  However, there are a few aspects of the app that left me slightly disappointed. One of the features I enjoyed in the previous HBO Max interface was the easy access to genres through the sidebar. It made it convenient for me to explore different categories and discover new content. Unfortunately, the Max app makes this process more cumbersome, requiring excessive swiping and searching to find a specific company or genre. This change felt like a step backward in terms of user-friendliness.  Another drawback I noticed is the absence of a feature to delete a family profile. This omission puzzled me, as it seems like a basic functionality that should be present in a streaming app. It can be frustrating not being able to manage profiles effectively, especially in a family setting.  Despite these downsides, the Max app still retains the overall look and feel of HBO Max, which is reassuring. The familiar interface and content library provide a sense of continuity. However, when considering the drawbacks and inconveniences I mentioned earlier, I don't find the new app compelling enough to warrant uninstalling the old one and installing the updated version.  In conclusion, my experience with the new Max app has been a mixed bag. While the faster loading speed is a definite plus, the hassle of finding specific companies or genres and the absence of a profile deletion feature are notable downsides. If you're an HBO Max user, I'd suggest giving the new app a try, but unless these issues are addressed, it may not be worth the trouble of switching from the previous version.",A mixed bag

3,2023-06-20 17:49:12,"First off, the whole thing feels a little more stable which is nice, so GOOD work there.  Simply a better set of options for organizing and viewing your own list would be welcomed.  What is NOT great is that the point in time that you are at in a particular video doesn’t show. Other streaming apps either show it to left of the progress bar or on the actual point at which you are. It would be a much nicer experience.  Another gripe about the progress/time scrub bar is that the arrow forward/back buttons on remotes no longer nudge forward or backward in 10 second increments. Instead it engages fast forward at a speed that is way too fast to quickly stop. It is very frustrating, and brings me to my final issue…  The fast forward/rewind speeds of the actual forward/backward buttons need be addressed in that there needs to be a much slower first-press speed, and a much faster last press speed; I mean slow-mo to fast enough to get to the midway point of a 3 hr movie within a few seconds and completely fast forward through the entire thing in under 10 seconds. It would be extremely welcome for us.  Lastly, as a lover of all things Discovery (especially ID), BRAVO on the new integration. It is a big task and I’m sure will only improve with time. We absolutely love all of the options available. Now just give a new show or movie a chance to gel before unceremoniously ripping it from the service - in some cases with forever cliffhangers - and you are the best thing available to consumers by a mile!  Sincerely and with the utmost respect, A humble, lifelong lover of HBO and Discovery",Better player

3,2023-05-26 03:45:17,"The message was that the hbo max app was going to  automatically become the max app. So far I have had to download a new app and delete the old one on my iPhone and Samsung tv. Thankfully my login still worked, although I guess they wouldn’t delete my payment info because that’s what they really want.   I really liked the set up to HBO Max, specifically the list based off studio or whatever they titled the list of DC universe, HBO originals, Cartoon Network, Studio Ghibli and the other ones, I also loved the list of genres those lists allowed me to say I want something I haven’t seen before that is like this other movie or show I watch.   Max only has 3 menu options; Home, Search and My Stuff which makes it a lot harder to browse or find something if you don’t know the name of it.   I was excited for Discovery + to become part of HBO Max because there were documentaries I wanted to see on there but don’t remember the names and it’s hard to find them seeing as there is no Discovery list. All the emails I received said that Discovery + was becoming part of HBO Max and it was being called Max and you wouldn’t loose anything. Well I lost the browsing ease I had before.   All they had to do was add what was available on Discovery + to HBO Max and change the name to Max and yet they went with the deactivate the old apps and delete the entire menu that organized things so nicely and made it easier to find something new to watch in the same style as what you enjoyed before. I don’t like the “you might also enjoy list, because it not accurate and it’s marketing off what they can make money off of. I personally hate the show Rick and Morty, and yet it shows up on multiple “you might also like” lists for me. How is Rick and Morty in anyway related to live action DC universe works? I think it’s more about the Rick and Morty merchandise they have for sale.   Bring back the menu lists of genres and groupings by studio or channel or universe or however they did it, because that is what I liked the most about HBO Max.",Problematic

2,2023-07-11 12:44:16,"Interface is terrible on Apple TV.  Rewind and fast forward will bug out and force you to hit the back button to get out of the interface. This then undoes the time change and puts you back where you started.  Sometimes the back buttons does nothing and you have to close the app. Garbage.    Want to rewatch a watched episode?  Find it and hit play. You will see the last 3 seconds of that episodes closing credits just before it skips to the next episode. What? Every streaming app out there would have just restarted this episode from the beginning as expected. Not the new MAX!  Want a description of the episode? No longer available when you highlight a thumbnail. You now have click into a few sub menus to find and read the description. This is also where you need to go to find the now hidden “restart” option for an already watched episode.    Had a few episodes play while you were away or fell asleep? Want to rewatch them? Click on the show conveniently under “Continue Watching” and…. it instantly continues playing where it left off. No interface for the season or show at all. You literally have go to the main screen, “Search”, type in the name of the show, click on the show, select the season, then GUESS which thumbnail you want because the episode descriptions are buried under the “Episode Details” button.  Ugh.   Every other streaming app is more intuitive than this crap. And have been for YEARS. The old HBO Max was fine. This new MAX is complete garbage on the Apple TV.  It’s like the Apple TV app was designed by an intern or diversity hire that has zero to little experience.  Do better, Warner Bros!",Terrible on Apple TV

2,2023-06-19 05:43:11,"Truly this is a fall from grace. HBO Max was my favorite steaming service of which I have used. Now I hate it. Ignoring all of the blatant downgrades, and tangibly terrible features, my biggest problem is the download limit.   It is useless and, from what I can tell, serves no purpose other than to force people to buy the more expensive version, which is an even worse deal in my opinion. Essentially you can only download 30 episodes or movies at any given time on the middlemost expensive option. That sounds pretty bad, but considering that most other streaming services allow you to have an unlimited amount, it’s very terrible. Really, 30 items? Reallllly? Think of it, most shows have about 12 episodes per season. You have even download 3 seasons of a single show! And it serves them no purpose other than to make money.   Think of it, why would they not want you to download more shows, instead of an unlimited amount of shows as it used to be on HBO max? It couldn’t be anything to do with data, and it’s not running of a server when I watching it off of what I downloaded on my phone. Money! It always comes back to that. They went form paying whatever it was per month, for an observably great service, to a terrible service, with to option to pay more for a slightly less terrible service, to a service that isn’t even worth considering, considering that 4 extra dollars isn’t worth it.  The UI has also had a considerable downgrade too. I won’t go into much detail in this part, but things being sorted alphabetically, and more stuff like they were very convenient. And that’s the sole purpose of a user interface, is convenience, not to spend minutes looking to find something to watch when it should take seconds at most.   Albeit, I still cannot deny the library. It’s still probably the best. Shows and movies that everyone likes; classics, new movies, shows and more, were, and are still there. But what’s the point if I can hardly download much of them, or it’s tedious just to find them. If you look to TV channels, what do you do? You go to the guide and scroll down the channels. Very simple, but a thousand times more easy then the milquetoast UI of Max now. They tried to copy Netflix, and failed terribly. They have the categories like Netflix, but you can only see two cards instead of many more as it should be. So you have to scroll to the side very slowly, and you can only see two or three of the categories at a time, and that’s just one example. Imagine spending hours using the UI and picking it apart then and all the flaws you could find within it.  Again, this is a call for grace. HBO Max was almost undoubtedly the best. The three main things it had going for it were a good library, a good UI, and generally not being frustrating, with glitches and all that. From what I can tell it has only kept one of those. And that is a loss, considering that some of my favorite shows are on there. Essentially, HBO Max was great, Max is bad, fix it please.",Who thought of this?

1,2023-05-23 12:22:47,"The Max app represents a *horrible* regression from the already supremely crappy HBO Max app. The UI is cluttered; the lack of sufficient margins around buttons makes them look and feel claustrophobic; navigation around the UI doesn’t support the native “leaning” paradigm, so movement from element to element is sudden, jarring, often unexpected and unintended, and can even happen *after* clicking a button to navigate to a submenu or play a video (admittedly, this is a holdover from the HBO Max app); the player itself, which is a custom implementation (alas, an all too common trend), doesn’t even support basic Apple TV functions like using the remote ring as a jog wheel for slow scrubbing; and perhaps the biggest regression—the app no longer integrates with the Up Next list in the Apple TV app. This is almost certainly a cross-platform atrocity that Warner Bros. Discovery is trying to pass off as platform-native app—and it shows. It’s also clearly just an (inferior) re-skinning of the bug-ridden HBO Max app, despite HBO executives’ insistence that the app would be “rewritten from the ground up.” (And to top it all off, once you stream something from within the Max app, Warner Bros. Discovery appears to bar your account from accessing the “classic” HBO Max app, precluding the ability to revert to that slightly less terrible older app—with no advance warning whatsoever.)  And this is all in addition to the continued foolhardy adulteration of HBO’s peerless array of first-class content with lowest-common-denominator tripe from the company’s Discovery and network TV libraries. Warner Bros. Discovery’s behavior betrays a fundamental lack of respect for its viewers and represents a continued squandering of the formerly nonpareil brand equity that HBO had spent nigh fifty years painstakingly accruing. David Zaslav should be ashamed.",Horrible Regression & Continued Erosion of the HBO Brand

1,2023-07-05 13:20:58,"Don't really see why we needed to download a new app when they could've just updated the old one and make the changes they needed to do with that like every other streaming platform does?!?  Also really annoyed they are limiting screens to watch at the same time like Netflix is did with how many screens you want to pay for. A lot of people dropped Netflix in favor of MAX, so they continue down the same route of Netflix, they will lose a lot of people eventually as well, especially with the high price we are already paying for HBO.  Issues with new app is annoying. I have Apple TV and the newer model remote, I will be scrolling with the touch pad and after about 10-15 options (or less sometimes) it's takes me back to the very top of the page making me having to go all the way back down to the row where I was searching, thankfully it doesn't start me from the very beginning of that row with having to scroll to where I last was, but having a glitch every time I scroll from side to side is not a fun thing to deal with. I tested it with using the buttons on the remote instead of the touch pad and same thing! So I know it's not an apple thing and an app thing!  My advice to MAX, don't go the Netflix route and if it's not broke stop trying to fix it. Small improvements with updates are welcomed, but a whole new app for us to download was a bit ridiculous! Also stop raising prices! You guys don't enough original or new content to justify going higher in price then you currently are!",Why??

1,2023-09-26 01:24:27,"I’ve been updating my review since May 2023 since the app changed. Now, I can’t update it anymore. It’s gone. It’s frustrating bc it was extensive— but fret not! I remember all my complaints :) here they are, enjoy:  September 2023 -I start my show, and it turns up as green. The contrast is completely messed up.  I have to go back to Home and restart it  -Also, when I pause and then unpause, it starts back up somewhere completely different.  -Also, I don’t see an option to remove shows from my History so that I can rewatch them—once it’s watched, and I want to rewatch it, I click an episode, and it goes to the very end of the episode which is where I stopped the last time I was watching. It’s a mess.  -Moreover, sometimes I start playing an episode and the screen doesn’t fit in my TV, it’s literally 4x the size of what it should be. - It also does this thing that if I click on my show from Continue Watching, it sometimes goes to blank black screen & plays audio from a different movie / show.  Previously, between May-August 2023, the app didn’t show the “Continue Watching” section properly (they fixed that).   They also had an issue where I had English CC turned on but it wouldn’t show up. The only way to make it show up would be going to Subtitles, choosing a different language CC, then choosing English CC again. And still, sometimes it wouldn’t show up. (This has been since fixed).  If I remember something I will for sure add. I am 99% sure most 5 star reviews must be paid, there’s no way so many people are happy, just read the other 1star reviews. Too. Many. Issues.   HBO messed up big time switching to this “MAX” app. Why fix something that wasn’t broken? Why did you get such a terrible team of incompetent app creators? I’ve never had that many issues with an app.",Worst. App. In. the. history. Of. Mankind.

1,2023-05-24 12:44:23,"Time Warner has managed to ruin all of the things that were good (or at least decent) about the experience from the HBO Max app on tvOS.  For starters, this should not have required a new app install, it should have just updated the old one in place given their plans to shut off access to the old app. Bad planning to foist that pain onto users for no good reason.  Now, getting to the actual app. It was a big controversy when HBO Max switched from the native tvOS player to its own custom inferior player, so they promptly reverted the change. So what does the new Max app do? Implement a far inferior custom player that doesn’t work with most of the basic built-in functions of the tvOS player or feel like an app designed for the platform. I would choose stronger words to analogize this but given it’s an App Store review, I’ll just say it’s downright insulting and user-hostile.  On top of that, for the first hour after I installed the app I couldn’t even get it to sign in and was getting server side errors when trying to view the “sign in with provider” page. Ugly black & white unbranded error pages full of technical jargon which should never be shown to users to begin with. This is how they decided to ship this broken, subpar app. I gave up and was fortunately able to sign in the following morning.  Fix your terrible app. If you’re going to build a custom player, it had better be incredibly good and come with all of the standard functionality of the built-in player. But since it’s clear your software team doesn’t have the capability of doing that, please just switch back to the built-in tvOS player. You will not do a better job designing a usable playback experience than what Apple has given you (basically nobody else does).",Ruined everything that was good about HBO Max on tvOS

For example, there are also shows that won’t even cast to my TV and an “unexpected error” message will pop up onto the TV. When the “something went wrong” pops up when it has trouble casting to my TV it says “please try again. If the problem continues, visit BEAM.com/help” with the “if you contact us about this error, please include the following code” I don’t think that’s a real website, PLEASE look into this “beam.com” and fix it.

It’s useless to me if I’m not home. Not worth the price. Discount it if I can only use 1/2 the service! Customer service? First one so flustered they “put me on hold” then hung up! Second call? With all the girls giggling in the background I had zero confidence in them being able to do anything and I was right! They “ escalated it to their tech team who will EMAIL me?!?!?!!! Dear Lord!

1,2023-11-07 16:09:36,"My app is acting up and I can’t read or see half of the screen. They sent me an email saying beginning December 5. It will stream only be in an HD and no longer and 4K no longer in Dolby Atmos. Will only allow me to sign in on two devices. everything has lowered and quality about this app. Funny they tell me this while the apps not functioning. FYI, I pay for a premium no add package and they started showing advertisements for media. They produced by Max ahead of my shows still finding a way to play ads even though I pay for no ad service. Cheesy. Actually, I am mostly finding great entertainment from my Hulu app. More and more Max is forcing changes and lowering the quality and usually doesn’t have anything that I want so if my review helps somebody to make a decision, then don’t buy in to Max. Look at all of your other choices, especially Hulu. Disney is available on Hulu I love my Disney+ app. I’m just trying to get the word out there. They’re doing this really slick right after taking over and making all these changes matter of fact that are nothing better for the customer.  I responded to the Max support that answered this review and filled out the request form and gave them permission to email me and to use my email. Now this morning that person sends me an email and said somebody else on our advanced team is looking at this and they will let you know if they have any questions or updates. But this person named Ronnie didn’t offer to help me at all but they made me think oh they care. I’m gonna respond but they didn’t do anything and now I got to feel like something would happen but it didn’t extra disappointing.",Max has lowered the quality.

So I subscribed to Max, not expecting much, oh boy was I wrong… not only do they have all the new movies but they have oldies but goodies that I have not seen in years. They also have all the best sitcoms of the 90s. I am hooked. I watch it almost everyday.",So many good movies

This is on the AD -free version.  If it wasn’t paid by another party I’d consider others who have the same or similar at higher resolution for the money.  I understand band width is not infinite.

Given my preference for TNT broadcasts and the free access, it seemed like a great alternative to paying for YouTube TV.  However, my experience with watching sports on Max has been frustrating because it doesn't save my progress. It's frustrating to start from the beginning and manually navigate the progress bar to find where I left off.  Personally, I'm considering reactivating my YouTube TV subscription and discontinuing my Max membership. I would advise others planning to watch sports on Max to do the same.  It's definitely not providing a satisfactory user experience!",Watching sports on this platform isn’t ideal.
2,2023-11-02 19:54:25,Alright Max is cool and all but the fact that you’re making us pay extra for 4K and dolby atmos is not cool. It’s stupid cuz $15.99 is already a lot for a streaming platform and now yall are having people pay more than that just to have the features they currently had before?

The app is still slow and in general not the best from the ux perspective , but at least it’s functional now. Thanks to devs!  —  It used to work with my chromcast from iPhone and iPad for very long time, and now it stopped. So annoying, every time you turn off screen and open it back the movie resets. The only way to watch is turning it on and then using Google Home app to pause and continue.",Casting to chromecast is buggy with ios
1,2023-10-29 17:14:13,"On Roku, crashes, lags and freezes constantly. 10 sec rew button use to do exactly that but now just acts as 2nd rew button. Every week or so won’t let you connect at all if you’re subscribing through a cable provider, no matter what you do, says either your cable plan doesn’t have max and/or you have to create an account (account wasnt necessary in the previous app) again. This last time had to create a new account with new email and all my lists and settings vanished lol. Newest bug (10/29/23) is that in the middle of watching an eppy it goes to a black screen and there’s nothing you can do to fix it, although other eppys of same series are fine to watch.  Literally a new bug every week, I kid you not…  Features vanished such as the “Hub” where you could go to DC and find that Batman movies without much searching. Now, you actually have to type it in lol. Or the Last Chance where you can see what’s leaving. Other features like Subtitles (which I use all the time) didn’t work at first but now do, hopefully. No other apps on iOS or Roku have any of these issues. None….  Their first rollout of the Max app was arguably the worst functional, streaming app ever, both on iOS and Roku, I thought at the time (now this one beats it). They eventually improved it to where it was decent. So sick of the changes with every new app. Have it as part of a mandatory cable subscription package in my co-op and would cancel in a sec if not for that",Absolute s-show of an app now

1,2023-10-28 06:51:38,"Watching CNN live shows on HBO Max, is utterly ridiculous. Not only is there no way to pause a live show, even momentarily, it also cannot stay in sync with the picture in a picture supported on iOS. Returning to the HBO app causes live shows on CNN to wildly scam across the timestamps. There is also no tracking in the player, meaning that you will not be able to go back to where you were watching. It seems like the live aspect of CNN is an entirely true. It seems like ads are piped in locally to your device, causing you to be out of sync with the CNN broadcast.an app that has been remade so many times it’s not even funny, you would think that this could be the simplest of things. But like every other attempt, HBO has tried with streaming apps, it is another failure.",HBO is bumbling the CNN partnership
3,2023-10-27 00:07:17,"I've been in HBO subscriber for about 20 years and it's only been about two years since I cut the cable and I've been streaming everything. I had a feeling when HBO changed it its name to the dubious ""Max"" (way to tank a premium brand) that we were headed in a not great direction, but they have exceeded my expected disappointment. Every month, I pay $15 a month so that they can make no customer service directly available to me. I don't expect that for $15 a month. Over the course of a year that's a respectable amount of money. If you're going to change to a streaming platform, if times are changing in that direction, you have to change with it and that means that you have to have your own customer service available. Every time I'm watching something and the screen times out or the app is flatlined and then I click on it to go back into it, it starts what I'm watching back from the beginning. There are not words to describe my frustration. Now I feel like I have no choice but to get HBO through a provider like Hulu or Sling, or Amazon Prime, all of which are in my life in some way. I could cable because I wanted to be rid of that. I like to have options, so that if I'm not getting good customer service, I can leave. I don't like feeling trapped.

And now, while watching tv shows it has started to constantly restart from the beginning. Oh and btw there are no problems while showing ads. But while showing actual content it is pretty much unusable. The new “app” and the updates did nothing.

Too many bugs and the 4K Dolby Vision is mediocre—just compare the Dolby Vision version of AVATAR on Disney+ and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Ok, we got the addition of Discovery networks (though no one was asking for it), but after removing 4K Dolby Vision access from the ad-free $15.99 subscription, it is no longer a good value. HBO still offers good content, but  $19.99 for Max Ultimate and access to 4K is too expensive to keep for more than a month. We didn’t ask Warner/Discovery to bring their cable networks to HBO and charge a cable premium. I can’t imagine how much these streaming services are going to charge once their CEOs are forced to share their piece of the pie with the writers and actors who can’t even afford to pay for streaming services themselves.",Overpriced and Buggy

HBO apps used to have the most reliable captions, please fix these issues. pandering to a wider audience isn’t worth losing your existing customer base due to a lack of the quality we have come to expect.  8/27/23 UPDATE: downgrading to ONE STAR as most of the previous issues still occur, and some new ones have been added. when playback is paused then resumed it will start anywhere from 5 minutes back up to restarting the video completely. leaving an episode to finish later results in a black screen - it will not play at all. in your rush to scoop up some proverbial fat cash from consumers, you have neglected to provide a product that is worth paying for!

Once I get a show going, after 20-30 minutes, the sound will start getting delayed from the picture. Its incredibly annoying because you have to restart every time that happens. Ill end up doing that 3-4 times during a 45 minute show. The fast forward and rewind features? Forget it- I will try to find the place I stopped (because the app will lose your place if you pause and come back later ) and you find it, hit play and it still plays from the beginning.

1,2023-08-08 04:30:26,"This is an issue I did not face on the old HBO Max app, but face now on Max. In any shows, most recently White Lotus and Succession, transitions between scenes result in the video and audio stuttering. For example, in Succession this would happen when a shot changes from inside the office to birds eye footage of the city— big changes between scenes, not just two cameras switching. It only seems to happen on the iPhone application and is fine on my TV.   Furthermore, the 10 sec rewind button is mostly useless. It doesn’t work like Netflix, Prime, Youtube, or Hulu. Clicking it multiple times registers as a single 10 second skip back. On Max, I have to wait for the video to render, then click the button again in order to rewind 20 seconds, while on every single other service I can spam click and actually see the video render instantly, AND see a “-10”, “-20”, “-30”, etc with every spam click to know exactly how far back i’m rewinding.

Once in a blue moon I’ll get an error message for no reason, but I’m able to just refresh and fix it most of the time. Max has been my go to streaming app lately, took the place of youtube and netflix because both of those were getting too greedy.

Finally after getting past that screen and logging in, I was met with a new message saying I wasn’t a subscriber. About 3 weeks ago, finally got past that issue. Well, it’s happening again but this time my phone works, my Xbox works but my iPad is giving me the same message runaround that my phone gave me for months. I try connecting to my subscriber and it won’t progress from the login screen. How and/or why is it so hard to have a simple login ID for subscribers who get it through other services (such as AT&T). Why does this only affect one device at a time? Why does it tell me that I’m not a subscriber when I use the login MAX made us create some months back?

I have very high speed internet and I subscribe to all the streaming apps and I don’t have a single issue with any of them except for Max. Please upgrade your severs or risk losing the majority of your customers.

Because if not…you literally just failed again 🫤🫠  Having assisted with app developments myself, I have NO idea why HBO (or whatever their name is now - I don’t care) would not have had a more thorough beta testing. One would think that would’ve helped catch the many glitches I’m immediately experiencing - and would’ve also possibly helped fixed the poor UX. For one, every time I try to play episodes, after a few I just get an error message saying “something went wrong” with some long useless piece of code. Then it says “visit the help center” - which, not shockingly, is completely useless. Then, if you’re someone who say - has kids - and those kids like to watch episodes of their favorite shows over again, it is multiple steps to get it started whereas with the old HBO app, you just hit play and you were ready to go.

As in when I’m watching a movie/series as it cuts to the next scene it’ll start that glitch looping thing it does like a record skipping,So then I have to fast forward a couple minutes to get past the problem, that’s a no go. Let’s see here’s another one -your option selection is ridiculous I’ll explain. On the first of the month I went online to see what’s new on max this month and many’s sights show the exact content coming out (there’s plenty of content but none of it worth a crap) so when I go to the max app itself and look under just added there’s maybe 7 new movies or shows that pop up? Where’s the rest?  At least hbomax showed you all the new content on the app itself. Speaking of content and this is where it gets real bad. A documentary on Mary Tyler Moore…. Yea I’m serious. I’m 44 and that’s waaay for before my time. From what I’ve been hearing max wants to attract a younger audience that was the point of this big merger from what I’ve read. But ok.  Here’s another-Donna summer documentary… omg are you serious? I’m mid 40s and i barely know who this is.But you keep attracting that younger audience I’m rolling my eyes. And the commercials have gotten longer and more frequent no doubt another no go. On the bright side I just have 2 more weeks and I’ll be rid of this nonsense for good but I think I might just demand a refund.  Ps. I was on prime the other day and found a movie I liked but the only way to watch was to rent it or subscribe to Cinemax so I’m like cool I have max so it should be on there right?? Yea no not even close because that would make to much sense.  Pss. Checking out some free streaming apps I have and there’s equal to better content than max. Yea the free ones.  Psss.

It also has the same exact error screen upon opening. (All I have to do is press the back button and it works) but you’d think that would be fixed with something different than just a similar error code. All in all, I was very comfortable with the original app and then they went and changed it in a way I’d imagine was an attempt to appeal to the masses without actually asking them.

You’ve become the what all the other streaming services need to do because in the future I truly hope Paramount+ & Peacock combine then Hulu & Netflix combine.

3,2023-05-27 06:40:44,"I love this app but hbo max was a better app honesty even with all its flaws, There was more info and credits and trailers available and the rewind and fast forward feature was better before.  Also it seems the streaming errors and glitches have only gotten worse and more frequent and it kinda upsets me that the only reason why I had so many issues with hbo max recently was because the company decided to make the terrible decision of transitioning their name and app to Max and making all their customers suffer and pay for it. I never have this problem with Hulu, Netflix, peacock.. not even freevee!!? You’d think a high quality company owned by Warner bros would know how to make a functioning app like all the other competitors??  I’d rather have a functioning app with less programs at that point. MAX honestly hasn’t wowed me since I still watch the same programs I watched on the hbo app… and they’re still missing a lot of programs from hbo, Cinemax and Cartoon Network?? I’m kinda tired of excuses about licensing when plenty of people pay good money to watch HBO and Cinemax????",COULD BE SO MUCH BETTER!! And I’m not asking for much?

Another original feature was custom profile avatars, theyve since switched to the exact same format as every other platform, this wasnt a huge loss but disappointing nonetheless. The color switch is super uncomfortable going from a calm purple to an extreme blue just hurts my eyes. Also they removed the categories and recommendations just feels less personal.  Still good show selection but honestly i could just go to hulu since they have the same stuff. Bring back shuffle mane that was dope.",Removed the cool stuff :(

Also, if you have a favorite series and you like to re-watch episodes, rather than starting from the beginning, when you click on a watched episode, it will start from the very end and make you perform a separate action to restart just like Hulu.

1,2023-05-24 01:41:43,"I tried to login into my Amazon tablet like I have for the past 18 months to watch my HBO app. I can’t get it to work… Stop f$cling with stuff. Now I’m going to cancel my subscription, because I can’t watch it. It’s not like I can get anyone on a phone to help me, either.",Why do you make things so difficult!
1,2023-05-24 01:36:36,So far this app has crashed 2 apple tv’s and my android tv too.,Disaster.
1,2023-05-24 01:10:51,"I have used the HBO Max app for multiple years and loved how much more organized and easy to use the interface was. The biggest disappointment was that the neatly organized hubs have been removed. No more organized Adult Swim collection, no more sorting for all the Studio Ghibli etc. now we have this weird Amazon blue themed mess with a home button and a search button. Why they went out of their way to remove functioning stable features is beyond me. They could have just removed HBO from the name and called it a day.   To add salt to the wound the app only plays audio with a black screen on my Apple TV. And no using the old app because that’s been shut down. So I guess I have to cancel my subscription until it’s actually a service again. Not really worth paying for just the audio of my favorite shows.",Ruined a perfectly good app
2,2023-05-24 01:06:22,"First, the user experience is messed up… they add promotions and ads inside the content big mistake… that equalize the platform to declining formats like Hulu. For me there is no problem including promotion on front, but interrupting the experience, big mistake.   Second, the content is incomplete and interrupted, for example The Nanny, they uploaded Season 1, Season 3, 4, 5, 6…   Let’s see if they fix this details…",Really…
1,2023-05-24 00:11:13,I tried twice to sign in with YouTube TV account and it doesn’t work. It worked with the HBO Max app. This is terrible.,If I could give no stars I would

Awful decision by an awful company. Even Hulu is better",Awful app. Move to other services
1,2023-05-23 22:13:58,"Do you want to go from fixer-upper to sopranos in a few simple clicks? Well, I don’t. This is just muddying the waters of the great content HBO Max had. Not to mention having to spend more to get 4k? Also, the UI keeps jumping to the top row when browsing. Also, let me mention again you now have to pay $19.99 instead of 14.99 a month for 4k because they had to add all 44 seasons of Diners, drive-ins, and Dives (no guy hate here, but this isn’t what I’m looking for when I want HBO content). Lame.",Big eye roll
1,2023-05-23 22:12:42,"Whomever created the MAX app must’ve been the same that made the AMC+ app. It’s really bad - can’t read description text when you drill down the overlay is terrible, searching and browsing is about as clunky as it gets, generally unpleasant gui. Really miss the purple background - designers thinking “hey, what’s the most generic sad blue background we have?” 🤮 The “brand spotlight” is hidden in the search menu on iOS. Don’t get me started on how sluggish and the lag within the app using on the newest Apple TV 4K. …what did you write this with? Can’t even see the “up next” content in the main menu bar on the Apple TV? Piss poor execution and we actually appreciate the name “HBO” booooooooooo",Dumpster fire

2,2023-05-23 17:06:12,"I gave it two stars because: Good transition from HBO Max to MAX. It was simple and easy but I’ve switched to MAX literally no more than 5 minutes ago and  I get cut off with an error page popping up saying “There’s a problem with your device setup.” What does that mean? Then on the same page I’m given this incredibly long code to given if I contact them. Maybe once or twice I’ve gotten those error pages on HBO Max and they were so far and in between I didn’t even remember them. Not gonna lie kinda miss HBO Max. Why’d you guys change things we’re fine, we’ll for me anyway I’m sure you guys had your reasons but this isn’t doing for me. I just wanna watch “tbbt” lol",2 Stars

You have NOTHING to watch anyway except the Gold Digger show that I watch.  But now I can’t watch it wo the FORCED UPDATE. 3.  I can watch Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, STARZ, Apple TV, Sling tv w Dvr. Hulu, YouTube, Pluto, PLEX & a bunch of others.  I am not forced to update. Especially when you have nothing to watch. 4.
