Your account will remain banned as a result of the violation.  I've done nothing wrong and WhatsApp is my main messaging and communication app, I use it to study, work and most important to keep in contact with my immediate family members who live far from me in another country, i have never done anything illegal or against their policy on there and I'm desperate to get my account back. And I’ve not used any unofficial app I’ve always only used the official app. At this point I don’t even know yet if it’s a permanent or temporary ban I’ve sent hundreds of emails since this happened more than 6 days ago, I’ve tried everything I could imagine to get in contact with support and I’ve not received a single reply. I have not know from my family for days because of this and is starting to frustrate me more, the only option I have left is keep sending messages through Instagram and Facebook as well and even post this here because I don’t know what else I can do since this was obviously done by mistake.

1,2023-01-09 11:52:25,"Whatsapp is a wonderful app that I have used on a daily basis for years. but it has one abysmal defect.  For years it has been difficult, if not impossible to easily list the groups that you are a member of. As a result, duplicate groups get made because people forget that a similar group had already been created in the past, and there is no easy way to quickly list and edit the groups you are member off. There are hacks you can find on the internet to get around this problem, but for heavy users like me who belong to dozens of groups, this is a source of endless frustration. This last version finally offers a partial workaround, that is that in the new communities section you can pretend to create a new community and see in the process a list of the groups to which you have admin privileges. But this is just another work around, and it does not show you the groups that you are only a member of. For such a mature program to lack such a basic feature passes understanding. If this was 1.0 version of the software I’d give it 4 stars. But for a program that’s been on the market for years, this omission is inexcusable, especially considering that competing platforms allow you to manage groups with ease.",Group management a painful flaw
1,2023-09-20 22:38:39,"I opened WhatsApp and saw that my account was banned from using WhatsApp. I was given two options: submit a review or change my number.I tried to fight it but they were horrible in terms of helping or explaining. I barely use WhatsApp so I didn’t see how I was violating their terms. I submitted a review and after 3 days they told me the ban will stay. I submitted a second email asking them to reinstate it as I use WhatsApp for work, personal, and medical. They came back with a vague reason of why my account was banned and that it will not be lifted and to essentially not contact them again. Weeks later I found out someone had stolen my number and was using it on a third party messaging app. In high hopes I submitted another review stating the new findings above and they ghosted me. The only option I was given was to change my number to continue using WhatsApp. Obviously that is not the best option as I have a lot of other accounts and records linked to this number. This whole experience was awful so why would I change my number just to continue using this app.  This app is not worth it as I’m seeing a lot of other reports and reviews of other people randomly banned with little to no help.",Random permanent banning
1,2022-12-17 21:51:16,"My account and multiple people I work with all had our accounts hacked on the same day. WhatsApp claims that when you verify your phone number, any accounts still logged in on other devices will automatically log off, and they will have to verify your phone number. This is not true, for the people that hacked our workplace was still able to use our numbers and impersonate us. We have screenshots and a record of the times on Reddit. Not only did they take over our phone numbers, but they also changed the six-digit security pin and the emails associated with our accounts.   Customer support does not exist. There is nobody to talk to. You can send an email, but you’ll get an automated reply. They said that you could wait seven days to log into your account without a six-digit pin and delete your account that way. So while you wait the seven days, they have full access to your account and number.   WhatsApp is only end-to-end encrypted, meaning all messages are stored on the device that initially sent the message. Everything else can easily be exploited to gain access to your account. This severe security flaw has been used repeatedly with the addition of zero customer support.",**UNSAFE DO NOT USE**

I did everything: turning off and on the notifications from the app and my phone, shutting off my phone, resetting it, updating my phone and the app many times. Then I decided to just delete the app and reinstall. It did the trick. However now, I can’t back up my media on the app because of storage space. I’ve deleted over 2k of photos and videos from my gallery, deleted more than half my apps on my phone, and cleared/deleted multiple chats on iMessage and WhatsApp. I finally reached to the point where I was able to backup my stuff. It worked for a while, but then the app shut down. Once I opened it again, it told me I had to clear 5.34GB again. After deleting all those things, I’m required to delete more. My phone capacity is 128GB and my phone only holds 83GB. I don’t understand where the issue is and why this is happening. No, I did not contact WhatsApp support.

3,2023-07-28 12:01:58,"To the owners of WhatsApp, please i need you to do an upgrade on the backup plan for WhatsApp. You own Facebook, Instagram and Messenger app. The backup plan for these apps are awesome, where you just log in and get all information safe and intact. Even if you lose your phone, all you need is get a new phone and log in. Unlike WhatsApp, it's difficult to get your full backup plan, even if you backup every week in week out! You can't lose your phone or change your phone and guarantee a 100% full backup on WhatsApp. I lost my phone recently and i lost all files, even when i did backups every week, it didn't upload any information i needed. Please make WhatsApp like Messenger and Instagram, where you'll just add your number and password, then you log in with all information intact. Even if you lose your phones and you don't have your friends and family contacts anymore, with just a proper login, you can get their numbers back, safe and intact.

1,2023-07-24 19:47:17,"This app is full of fake accounts and scammers. Do not believe ANYONE on a dating app who asks you to move to talking to them on WhatsApp. I nearly had my entire account stolen if I hadn’t looked up popular whatsapp scams online first. If you are asked to go to WhatsApp, do not share your photos or your personal info like full name or date of birth or location proper. If things seem fine and then they send an emoji that makes no sense, do not bother opening the message. Immediately uninstall WhatsApp because the emoji will try and crash your WhatsApp and if you force close it without removing it first, it will crash your phone and then the scammer has full access to everything on your phone. I thought everything was fine until this guy sent me a cow emoji on a post about me telling him I hoped he had a good day. When I opened my WhatsApp the entire screen went blurry and I couldn’t maneuver the app, so I just went to the home screen without closing it, and then completely removed WhatsApp. I have had far too many people on dating apps try to get me to just use WhatsApp with very suspicious habits.

No. I look through all restrictions I could possibly have, none are turned on. All I sent to that friend was notifying them that I got the app and for them to have a good night. No cursing. No explicit language. No explicit photos. Nothing that would trigger their terms of service yet I got banned. I tried deleting and re-downloading the app, but when I enter my phone number the ban message was still there. I appealed to get my account unbanned earlier today and granted I may get a reply from them later. But it is still extremely annoying that this happened.

These creeps have some how found my number because of whatsapps trashy old system and have been abusing the fact that I cannot mute calls separately and have to individually report and block all of them. My do not disturb settings are set because in case of an emergency if someone needs their call to get through to me I will hear it ring the second time. However because of this stupidly underdeveloped app, random strangers from across the world have been disrespecting what should be a feature to keep my family safe and have been calling me at all hours because whatsapp is trash when it comes to privacy and safety and because they are behind on customizing your settings.

As we're aware, in many parts of Europe and Latin America, businesses rely heavily on WhatsApp for customer communication. In fact, I was explicitly advised by the hotels in Peru to use WhatsApp as the primary means of contact during my stay.  Right in the midst of providing crucial information to the hotel for my pickup arrangement, WhatsApp abruptly disabled my number. I promptly submitted a review request to reinstate my number, but to my utter dismay, WhatsApp not only failed to address the issue but completely banned my number!  I found myself stranded in the remote mountains of Peru, desperately needing to contact the hotel for pickup. Unfortunately, the hotel didn't answer my phone calls, and I couldn't communicate in the local language. To make matters worse, this happened just as the sun was setting.

It takes customer privacy and security into great context and go out of their way to protect that customer information from 3rd parties and hackers. I have never heard of a hack or security breach into WhatsApp security systems. Overall the App has been great and has eased the way the world has connected via talking and sharing digital and graphical data.   The only downside to WhatsApp is that when you lose your device or are out of storage and uninstall the app, you typically lose all your previous chats and data.

4,2023-02-06 04:29:10,I had a pop up from WhatsApp requesting access to all photos. I can't even remember the last time I used the app (it has been over a year) and at the time the pop up was displayed I was browsing in Safari. Since I didn't expect the pop up I mindlessly clicked Allow and then immediately went into settings to revoke all photos access. WhatsApp should not be requesting access to all photos out of the blue.  I'm giving 4 stars because the app worked fine as far as I remember.

4,2017-09-22 19:40:20,"WhatsApp in general is fine. But every photo I take in the app is fuzzy; and more zoomed in than my normal photos app. It’s like they are putting camera in video mode and taking a screenshot. I guess this is part of their cross platform library but still, I wish it would let the camera app use more native and high quality functionality.  Additionally, it’s wayyy too easy to send things to the wrong person. You can’t remove people from “recently contacted” or “frequently contacted” prompts around iOS for sharing. I’m terrified I will send my girlfriends brother something immodest because his name shows above hers even though our chat volumes are way different.  WhatsApp is a globally loved tool but has some pretty strange UX issues given its financial backer and experienced staff.

There’s nothing wrong happening with my version, the camera works well and shoots good photos. There are some things that would make this app the best messaging app. The first one is that when you mute a group chat there should be an option that allows you to mute it forever, same goes with the real-time location. When you create a group, others shouldn’t have the option to kick you from the group, and there should be an option to make someone not be an admin without having to kick the person and adding them again.

On Instagram, when you record a voice message it utilizes the iPhone mic instead of the AirPod mic even when using the AirPods. When I am having a conversation with someone via voice memos on WhatsApp, I have to turn off Bluetooth, then record my voice memo. After I’m done recording I have to turn Bluetooth back on. It goes on and off indefinitely until I am done with my conversation. So with that it would be awesome if we had the option to turn off the Bluetooth/AirPod mic only in a setting or just update it to be like Instagram where it records on the iPhones mic and only plays back on the AirPods.

It’s now 2022 and I still have to manually split long videos if I want to upload the whole thing to my status. I sure do hope the reason you haven’t added a feature to automatically split long videos into segments for WhatsApp status, isn’t because the world will explode if you do.

Now there is a delay to this change? It’s still going to happen so why the delay? Could it be that this delay is to collect our information anyway without a permission, anyway?

I use Facebook when I want to express some thoughts, events etc. But FB Messenger is not efficient in quick text, so I still resort to 20 years old practice in text msg like in Nokia phones. WhatsApp is subservient to the features offered by WeChat.  Understood that WeChat is by Tencent in China, nevertheless the features are amazing. The Moment posting functions are like Facebook  post. The conversation wether individual or in chat groups are more user friendly than WhatsApp. It allows recalling a wrong message sent in mistake. Attaching files and emojis are awesome. My only complain is that once viewed in one device the message cannot be reviewed in an other, which FB allows all history conversation once logged in.   I lived in America over 47 years.

I’d be lost without them. I’m grateful to be able to have your service.                Thank You, Paulette",Awesome!!!

You’re making WhatsApp into a little version of Facebook, did you see how many stars Facebook has on Apple Store? It’s almost -1 on top of the fact you can’t even express yourself cause y’all block our accounts….ridiculous!!!!!  Second:  I do not want any channels. I stay away from social media not to have to see any of these ridiculous celebrities and their nonsense…. Now i have BadBun ny displayed to be followed…… why? You need to make an option for people to TURN THESE OFF! I didn’t like it on Facebook and I don’t like it here. It’s gotten to the point i don’t even want to have WhatsApp anymore and I’ve had it for over 12 years……. Stop trying to perfect this and perfect the signal and audio/video quality. Some of us are old school and don’t want to look into celebrities…. I only watch my contacts stories….   Third:   If you keep adding more “technology” to this app a lot of people will stop using it…. Mark my words…. We liked the SIMPLICITY of the app, how easy it was for us to communicate with our families in other countries…. Now it’s like i said in the first paragraph “a little version of Facebook” we don’t want that….. we want silence and privacy….

No one has reported my account either and all of a sudden my number has been banned. I requested a review but was told there is nothing they can do about it and they had no reason to give to me as well for banning my number from WhatsApp. The only option i have now is to sign up with a new number and this apparently that means i’ll loose my previous texts and chats with friends from my contact and this is really bad!! I tried signing up again with the same number and I was told to wait for 12 hours to be able to verify my number with the one time password (OTP).

3,2018-11-17 19:04:25,"When IOS updated several months ago, one of the features that was affected on WhatsApp was the option to sync contacts. I called Apple then and they informed me that each app provider must update their security profiles to be compatible with the new IOS. There have been 2 updates of IOS since then and still, WhatsApp hasn’t got with the program.   Utility of WhatsApp has gone down as I have to research each contact to try to even place a call to them. Numbers that are in my phone book don’t register so it’s difficult to know which contact is which without that extra step in research. Furthermore, I can’t save new numbers directly from WhatsApp to my phone. This is quite frustrating. I have never left a review on this app before and decided that 5-6 months of this is enough. Can you please update your app to resolve this issue with iPhone!",Still not syncing contacts since iOS update months ago

And the person that did it, tried to scam my friends, family and business associates out of money by saying he was me and needed to borrow money. This was the moment I realized whatsapp support was zero help. I sent them messages and they replied with copied text from their FAQ. It was ridiculous. They did help one bit as it almost felt like they were supporting my hacker.   Make sure you set your 2FA. And if you get hacked, delete whatsapp and change the SIM card in your phone. Then you have to wait 7-days for the email authentication to reset. My hacker kept resetting it so it actually took a lot longer.   C’mon whatsapp! Figure out how to shut these guys down.

Sometimes I’ll be on a phone call from my actual phone, and then when I get off the phone an hour later, and if someone from WhatsApp is trying to call me, it’ll say “Missed Video call from____”. To me, it’s annoying how if I’m automatically on a phone call, the WhatsApp video call won’t go through period. WhatsApp should let the video call go through, so even while I’m on my phone during another phone call, and I see someone calling me, I can answer the other. Sometimes it’s important and I need to answer because it’s family from another country, but I never can because WhatsApp automatically tells them I’m on another call, but doesn’t notify me. Fix it.

Every time this requires user to completely close app and re-open it again.  Please fix these bugs and do more testing before you release updates.   At least you fixed the more annoying bugs mentioned below. Thanks for that.   Dear Developers, this last update totally screwed up the app. - I’m getting blank screens where you can see the text box while typing. - The list of chats keeps moving down before you can select on it (so you enter the wrong chat) or - when stationary it always selects the chat below the one you select. So you have to select another chat to get into the one you want. Seriously? Revert to a previous safe build and do more testing before you push new updates out, it’s becoming annoying enough to make me want to report these bugs in a review. Happy to submit screen shots or video with version/phone info if needed (latest updated iOS and WhatsApp updated). Other then that my only other WhatsApp suggestions is -to allow users to edit or delete their messages (outside of disappearing messages) - to allow chat backup to other drives or apps or make it easier to use",Bugs

Nevertheless there are other great things that are being taken a way from the apps that need to be reconsidered for great and greater experiences.  Not sure if it’s a bug that would be fixed or deliberately done. Few things I noticed are; 1) The inability to fast forward or rewind voice messages. This is very handy function as sometimes we just need to quickly get a point from a voice message we have previously listens to and so on.  2) When viewing status that has audio we have the ability to increase the audio by using our phone volume keys and able to set it to the desire volume. But now it’s volume is static once you push the button at the start of the status it added audio that can neither been increased nor decreased.   Please try to look into this as it’s embarrassing having your phone on highest volume in public places and be unable to adjust it.

1,2018-09-09 20:12:45,"WhatsApp has a ridiculous design flaw that needs to be changed immediately. The ""Autodownload photos/videos"" feature on the iPhone has a severely annoying feature in group chats. While I want things downloaded, I DO NOT WANT THEM ADDED TO MY PHOTO LIBRARY. The reason why is that I was in a large public group, and a spammer joined an started posting porn. This was auto-downloaded, added to my photo library, and then auto-transferred to another photo library. As a result, a spammer ended up adding a bunch of porn to my photo library, which was then uploaded to a second backup, and almost ended up with it uploaded to social media. I had to spend hours clearing multiple libraries of this crap, and I still cannot be 100% sure I got everything.   To be clear, I want to be able to see images that the group posts, and I want to be able to download and add them AT WILL. But the automatic addition to my photo library is an insanely stupid feature I never would want.",Horrible design flaw
5,2021-08-30 17:48:13,"WhatsApp is on a roll! After years of slow development and lack of features, it has improved considerably the last year: Disappearing Messages (7 Days) View Once (disappearing) Archive (to mute groups from disturbing you) Media Upload Quality (option for HD) And more features are incoming: Link Devices, Voice Message improvements and so forth. However, a few more features could improve the app considerably: a /Poll feature for groups so members or work groups can vote. Folders on top of the screen (to differentiate groups or classify them). /Pin more than 3 chats. A new UI to freshen up the app. Otherwise, WhatsApp seems to be on the right track!","Massive improvements, faster development to WhatsApp!"

I have an iPhone and in order to have the dark theme on WhatsApp you have to change your overall, general settings for the entire phone meaning every application would then have a dark theme. I don’t necessarily want my entire phone to be on a dark mode; I only want certain apps to have a dark theme (WhatsApp is one of those apps that I want to be in dark mode). So again, WhatsApp should have a setting that makes it possible to switch between light and dark mode, exclusively within the app so users have the choice of having WhatsApp in dark mode without having to have other apps or their entire phone in dark mode..

I know for a fact I didn’t break any stupid guidelines either so the people behind this god awful app just randomly out of the blue decided to lock me out of my account. So if the people behind this app actually take a look at feedback (which clearly they don’t considering they have multiple complaints about this issue) I just want them to know they failed as a company and they should be ashamed and they should be focusing on either A: trying to fix this terrible app. Or B: just take it down from the AppStore so that they don’t waste anyone else’s time.,Absolute Waste of a App

It would be great if you could add an audio to your status update - I have and seen other people too create an Instagram story to screen record then upload on WhatsApp. Everything else about the app is fine but this feature is what sets WhatsApp apart from other platforms. I can text, FaceTime or actually call my friends and family on any other app but since I travel a lot, a majority use WhatsApp more than Instagram and Facebook so I can keep them updated and entertained on my status.

It’s also wild knowing all the drug dealers that use the app that my account would get banned. lol. So far whatsapp has been TRASH!

Tried this on more than one device where I‘m using what’s app (and no contact access granted). I cannot help wondering if this is some sly manner to force users who haven’t granted the app access to contacts, to force them to do so?

Maybe have an option to set a time frame of when and when not receive video or voice calls. Maybe also add an option of “never” or only allow calls from saved contacts.

5,2018-01-05 10:30:50,"Due to relocation outside of the US, this app has been my “go to” and main source of communicating with family and friends.  I have tried other apps similar such as Skype, however his app by far is the best in regards to quality and reliability. I rarely have issues with calls and video chats dropping and the messaging is superb. The picture quality while using video is very clear and although my family and I are thousands of miles away, with the use of this app we are still able to feel a sense of home.

I’m afraid that I will not be able to get a copy of a list of my contacts once my account gets closed down—and I want to know the reason why it is looming on the foreground and can I do anything to prevent it from happening?

4,2018-05-01 11:46:44,"I really like that this app allows me to speak to anyone that is available on here without having to worry about paying some huge fee if it is someone overseas. However, there are a few issues I have with this:  1. I am not sure if this is just my connection, but whenever I am in a video or voice call, I often find that it keeps disconnecting me from the call and a lot of times, I cannot hear the other person.  2. The thing that really bothers me when it comes to calling others on here is that if the connection gets screwed up, I will constantly hear this loud beeping sound, which gets very annoying after a while.  What I personally suggest would be to have it where it doesn't beep so loud. Some could say that I am just sensitive to that, but I find that even if the volume is very low, the beeping can be quite loud, while I can barely hear the one I am talking to on the line.  Again the constant disconnecting could be because we are in 2 different countries or it could be my internet speed. The thing that I would really like to see change is definitely removing that assinying beeping sound!","Pretty good, but there are some things that bother me."

This app makes it so much easier for me to communicate with him! The app does an excellent job providing text, call, and video call options. I mostly use the texting, and it’s awesome because it’s encrypted between you and the other person so no third-parties can have access to it. Another note is that my dad doesn’t have any social media and this app has made it so he can talk to my brother without having to use someone else’s social media or using my mom’s, mine, or my little brother’s phone to contact him. All around great app, and I haven’t had any issues with it.",Great App!

The only suggestion I would make is I think WhatsApp should also add filters for the photo button along with lenses a lot like Snapchat. I think that would be rlly cool and I’d be looking forward to seeing how that would look like.  Ok so I changed this recently. WhatsApp was working just fine until now. Whenever I open WhatsApp, and I’ve tried restarting my phone multiple times, it crashes and the volume button shows up and starts to flash and do really wierd stuff and it blocks my sight and won’t turn off. But whenever I go back to close the app suddenly my screen is working all fine.

5,2018-02-13 00:20:47,I love the app okay. I use this app to meet new people all over the world but one thing that i hate well make it two. One of them is the quality of the pictures and videos you post on your story. I upload and share high quality videos and pictures but when you post them to the app it makes everything low quality. It’s so annoying and second is the video duration. 30 seconds it’s too short. I want to oust some fun and funny videos but in order to do that i have to cut it in to pieces which is annoying. WhatApp should make a video last at least 3 minutes. Please read this team WhatsApp I enjoy your app but these two things need to be fixed. Thanks,It’s an awesome app but......

4,2021-03-04 18:53:03,"The Read Receipts and the Last Seen are very LIMITED in their options.   Here are a couple of features I wish to see in WhatsApp:  LAST SEEN: - Exceptions: in addition to the original options (Everyone, My Contacts, Nobody), *Exceptions* gives you the option to include or exclude specific contacts from the above settings. (Telegram app already has this! I don’t know why WhatsApp hasn’t!)  READ RECEIPTS: - option to turn on/off *read receipts* for INDIVIDUAL contacts. (iMessage already has this option!)  Or similar to the Last Seen options (in telegram): - “Enable Read Receipts” for: Everyone, My Contacts, Nobody,” with Exceptions!  The purpose of the additional options is:  We all have a variety of contacts. From those who bombard you with messages when they see you were recently online (and/or text you as soon as they see the Read Receipt) to your friends who are more respectful of your space.  We have some contacts from whom we’d rather have more privacy; while others with whom we’d like to have more transparency.

Ever had to scroll up to look up that location ? Lol  2- An event creator feature where all your friends can rsvp and it notifies the group of any updates. I have many groups where we organize sport events and night outings an we manually update the list  3- allow for an account to be link to email so if you get a new number you can retrieve your old account.

Another thing is that one friend’s number was hacked.  The person who hacked it began sending me threatening messages.  I blocked and deleted him, but somehow he defeated the block and came back even more threatening. Again, I reported and blocked him. Please check the report from me.

Another feature I would love to see it to be able to search stickers by typing in search banner. I know it is hard because they are not categorized but maybe there’s something to do. Another feature I recommend is not to put message deleted when someone delete a message. Apparently if someone deleted a message they don’t want the other person to know that they deleted one. One more feature I am looking for is the ability to sort chats in different ways, read and unread, by name, by time and so on.

If I wanted to download a photo or photos, I would do it manually, like I do with any other app. What’s more, when I tried to figure out how to toggle it off, WhatsApp’s own instructions are wrong; it tells me to look for an option that doesn’t exist.

For iphone users like me, not being able to auto-delete media after a day or so the media was seen or auto-archive them to google photos, for instance, is the most annoying thing I have to manually do regularly in my phone. The only part taking advantage of this lack of functionality is Apple by selling more cloud subscriptions. People will eventually give up and subscribe to apple cloud for more space.

They need to make money somehow. And how do I know how else they may be using my data? Read their own huge privacy statement and judge for yourself how vague it is.  If you are not concerned, then go ahead and use it. When it first started, it was a great app. I used it all the time.

Just one suggestion some times in a group chat we want to avoid a particular individual from some conversation and as a result we end up creating a new group each time and that group is never used again after that conversation. Why don’t you create a option in Whatsapp group where you can create a conversation subgroup and select who should be involved in it from the group and once the topic is discussed the conversation subgroup can be closed. This helps a lot of user in personal and business purposes. Just a suggestion and I believe it’s do able.,Complement and recommendations

1,2021-08-05 19:48:39,"WhatsApp needs a serious rewrite to be viable on iOS. Right now, it commands so much of the phone’s RAM that other apps in the background will “reset” to their default state when using WhatsApp. This is because iOS aggressively manages memory and because WhatsApp uses so much memory, iOS will de-allocate memory being used by apps in the background. This is pretty sucky because it means that I lose my place when reading a news article and leave the app for a few seconds to check my messages. To the engineers: for the love of god find a way to make your app more memory efficient.  “Please update the app to use whatsapp” more like delete whatshapp. Disgusting.

Additionally, the app freezes during usage, disrupting workflow and necessitating restarts. Despite updates, these problems persist, hampering the app's usability and reliability. It is crucial for WhatsApp's developers to address these issues promptly, improving sound notifications and resolving freezing problems. Such improvements would greatly enhance the user experience and restore trust in the app's functionality.  Feel free to modify and adjust this shorter version as per your requirements.",WhatsApp's Overlapping Sounds and App Freezing: A Frustrating Experience

I’ve been using WhatsApp for years and they never prompted me to create 2FA so I didn’t. The hacker was able to set 2FA and now I won’t be able to access for 7 days, and customer support does nothing about this.  Now I have to enjoy a 7 day battle of trying to prompt logins on my side to make sure the hacker doesn’t login uncontested on theirs and message my contacts, but I am not actually able to access since the 2FA cant be reset for 7 days. They also refuse to do anything like disable my account for the time being for security concerns, what I am failing to understand is what their concern is since I can’t even access my account cause of their security issues.

Having friends and family in Europe, México, Central America, India, Iceland, Alaska, and with myself living in the states, WhatsApp successfully connects us all and ever so seamlessly.  One quip I have about this app is that although you can change the background wallpaper on the display between WhatsApp's included styles, solid color choices or personal pictures of your own, there is *-no_way-* you can change the font, it's color nor the bubble color behind what you’re writing.    After all these years, I'm still irked by not having the freedom of creating and affixing my own style-stamp for chats.  That 'creative freedom', as an option, is as fundementally necessary to express myself as is the message it contains.   Another vein of increasing public necessity is encryption for video, chat, calls, etcetera.   Both suggestions are an easy addition.  Oh. And wouldn't it be just lovely for WhatsApp to stop its attempts to railroad me into braiding my contact list in together with it?  If I'd wanted to share my personal information I'd have shared my passwords, too. It's the same thing.",4💫 With 3 Quips🧐

I contacted their customer service twice, but they were enable to tell me why it’s not working and they didn’t seem to care much.

I think this app would benefit from an option to not automatically save pictures, taken and sent from WhatsApp, to the camera roll.

The second response, if any, is unrelated to the query, and therefore as useless as the first response. The third response is nonexistent; WhatsApp support never sends more than one response after the automated message. It follows that you will never get an answer to your query nor any indication that your feedback or bug report will be forwarded to the appropriate team.

4,2022-05-11 16:41:14,"The app is pretty cool and it’s very convenient I must admit. However, there is an issue of sorting chats once you introduce groups to the mix. Let me explain.   Let’s say for instance, someone texts you and you’re about to respond but you get a group notification. You attend to the group for a while and when you come back to your chat you may forget about the previous text. Time goes by and you have conversations with other people until you realize you didn’t respond to that one text from a day ago.   The process of having to find the text itself whilst responding to others you may not have replied to; one by one is taxing .  I suggest for the next update, maybe we can install an “Unread” filter that allows us to sort the messages by those opened and those unopened. This will really make it convenient for responding quickly and keeping in touch with all messages. This would make a huge difference honestly.

2,2018-02-05 19:03:28,"With the latest iPhone update I can no longer click out of WhatsApp and hear the audios continue to play. It cuts them. This was a huge perk that everyone I knew as well as myself raved over as it allowed multi tasking while on phone. Another thing WhatsApp has never had and sorely lacks is that there is no option or ability (as there is on every other app and other messaging software or app such as Skype), to be offline or invisible. For those of us with many chats and many friends on WhatsApp there’s no ability to be invisible while on and anyone may say you and contact. Yes you can turn last seen off but you will still show as online when checking messages. This is my largest complaint about the app from a many year user.",Can no longer listen to audio outside of App

Support is trash; it's all pasted-in general information for kindergartener-level setup problems, they won't actually read your questions, and they'll close your unsolved issue to mark it resolved if you dare be to busy with work to reply to their nonsense after just one day (because ""it's been a while"" since they've heard from you).

1,2023-03-29 15:30:44,"My latest WhatsApp version on iPhone 13 Pro stopped working all of a sudden last night. After following all troubleshooting steps recommended by Apple team I figured out that only WhatsApp application is not functioning but rest all applications on my phone are working as expected.  Irrespective of offload/reinstall, delete and fresh install WhatsApp keeps crashing. Strange thing is that after deleting and reinstalling the WhatsApp in iPhone storage settings WhatsApp shows 22GB memory consumption which means good and bad. Delete operation didn’t really erase data and docs but bad thing is that it doesn’t allow WhatsApp to function when it gets reinstalled.   Most disappointing thing in this situation is that WhatsApp support team’s lack of intent to address this issue for their loyal customer. They don’t even attempt to understand and triage the issue but just prescribe a next step saying that it is iOS issue and I need to reconfigure my iPhone as a brand new device and ready to afford to lose all my other apps, data, etc. in this process.  I am expecting some one from WhatsApp support team to look into this review and address this genuine issue further.",WhatsApp crashes no matter what

It offers everything I wanted from WhatsApp without trying to invade my privacy or telling me to “piss-off” if I don’t like it. Sad because I really liked WhatsApp.  Update: Been using Signal since Feb. it’s now mid-March 2021.  No problems with my switch.  Just about everyone I chat with moved too so it’s been no hardship at all. Now Facebook is playing hardball and killing app function if you don’t comply with their demand.

One thing I should mention that after searching a new number in the contacts if you just tap on any part of the contact it directly goes for call. I think sometimes it’s embarrassing that may be you are not sure that the saved number is actually to whom you want to call.

One persistent glitch that has not been effectively addressed is that no matter how I configure the notifications, whenever I receive a WhatsApp message now, it just pops up right in the center of my screen instead of at the top, as I had set it up to do. This gets in the way of anything I may be doing, like streaming a show, or using another app.  Interestingly, after the latest update, my messages started appearing as a banner at the top of the screen - as they once used to do - and they lingered there (as I also set them up to do) but out of the way. So I thought the problem had finally been fixed. However, after an hour or two, the WhatsApp messages I received went right back to popping up right in the center of my screen; obstructing everything.

Either make it possible to finally switch off status updates for everyone , or for individual.      And please remember what you told us users when you launch this app, you told us is for chatting and it’s gradually turning to social network. I feel like I’m not in control anymore .

It would be nice if WhatsApp had a compatible app for the Apple Watch so I could receive, respond to and send messages from my Apple Watch instead of a simple notification. I use WhatsApp to communicate with coworkers and it would be very beneficial to have the expediency of using WhatsApp on my Apple Watch instead of having to go to the office and get my iPhone so I could respond to important messages.

We used to use GroupMe, which I enjoyed much better due to the fact that you can like messages and it looked a lot cleaner. WhatsApp is great because it’s easier to share content on it but it is very disorganized and the distracting background makes it feel as though I’m not able to focus on the actual content of our conversation and I feel as though I’m always missing something. I would prefer if the background was a solid color, like GroupMe, because it feels more organized and less chaotic. Those two features (liking messages and more organized/professional) would change my opinion of WhatsApp from a two to a five.",Messy/distracting organization

I was on a group trip in Mexico and my first day there I lost contact with my group due to this. It was completely frustrating and unsafe to be in a foreign country and unable to contact the group I was with or anyone because in Mexico, like almost all foreign countries the preferred method of communication is WhatsApp. I find it absurd the ONLY way to get it reviewed and possibly overturned is to wait the 24 hour review period. I tried to find a phone number to call, nothing. I emailed the support team and they responded unfortunately I have to wait the review period. I wasted so much time of my trip trying to solve this and with NO CONTACT of anyone in my group. The ban was finally lifted but the app never downloaded. It has been 5 days…",Banned

1,2022-07-10 08:21:01,Whatsapp just removed the option “Add exception” where you could choose the last seen status to “Nobody” and then you had this option in a separate line below it to “Add exception” where could allow only specific people of your choice to see your “last seen” status and obviously you could see their status as well. BUT not anymore.   Whatsapp just selfishly and forcefully removed that option just to force you give them access to your “phone contacts” which do want to do so and we should  never be forced to do so. It is horrible that WhatsApp behaves people this way. So inconvenient! It seems that they don’t care about our privacy and choice at all.   ** Let’s make WhatsApp understand this and get the option back.,“Add exception” option to Last Seen status removed!

There was a time when I was able to send a huge 4gb 12 minute video file. It would be compressed but still looked great. Through various updates they’ve continually changed the size it would let you send and receive. Fortunately I can still forward those large files, since I did them in the past. However, I can no longer upload and send files that large anymore (unless I'm forwarding one I had uploaded back when I could).

I don’t feel as sad about leaving them anymore (I vacationed there for a month) because I can talk to them whenever I want.

I updated this to 4 stars after getting a response from WhatsApp explaining that they had changed the settings to enable seeing name only. The reason for not giving 5 stars is that the method of doing so is not intuitive and doesn’t really make sense. It involves enabling preview in WhatsApp and disabling on your iPhone. Other apps just give the option of “name only” , “name and message “ or “just alert” (check Signal).

Often times I will be in the middle of recording an audio note when suddenly I receive a phone call.  When this happens, my entire audio note erases and I lose everything I had just recorded prior to receiving the call.  I have been 5 or 6 minutes into record when this happens, and it makes me really angry that it just all of the sudden erases.    To fix this issue, can something be done, please, that either pauses the recording so that it can later be resumed, or forces the recording to send immediately upon receiving a call?

Second when playing any audio from WhatsApp, like a voice note or a video I can not lower or raise the volume from the buttons. I have to go into the control center and lower or raise it from there. And the last and maybe the worst part is when I try to search for a chat, after typing in the name it lags and takes anywhere from 10-40 seconds to load and pop up!

So there is no way to add his new number or remove his old one. If their is a way to fix this that would be great. Maybe like a voting system.

4,2018-01-09 15:45:43,"WhatsApp is without a doubt the best social networking app I’ve ever used. And I’ve been using it for more years than I can count. Pretty much from the beginning.  And as times and technology have changed and advanced, so have the app’s features and capabilities.   Now for the reason I had to take off a star: Despite WhatsApp’s developments and advances it is still terribly behind in one area. And that is creating an app for Apple Watch users. Or at least a functional notification and response menu. So that when you receive a voice message from someone, you can actually listen to it without having to go to your phone. Which is the whole point of Apple Watch in the first place. And regarding the response options. It would be nice to be able to send more than one single emoji back, or to reply with a voice message, or at least proof/change your dictated message  if there’s a mistake in it.   Basically make an Apple Watch WhatsApp app!! Or improve existing interface for it",App for Apple Watch please! 🙏🏻
4,2017-09-08 04:22:35,"I love this app, I really do. It's got features ahead of its time, and I'm a huge fan of the end to end encryption! However, I do think some improvements could be made. A search function in chats, improvements to audio and video calls, and lastly the ability to set individual chat wallpapers.   This app however is great, it's zipping fast. It hasn't crashed on me. Another great thing is using whatsapp on the web, the only downside to that is that your phone just be on and connected to the internet. So if you lose your phone for example or the battery dies, you still can't see any messages from whatsapp.","A Great App, but not Perfect"

I’ve never sent one message on WhatsApp. Several articles I’ve read stated it could be from a post from FB that they didn’t approve of.  I talk about investing and markets on fb.

There is no WhatsApp for iPads and computers and that is NOT OK!!!!! I believe that WhatsApp should be available on all devices. Also when you delete messages it still stays it just blacks out the message and puts “this message was deleted” over it, this is not a big problem but it does make the chat a little cluttered.

So when I try to send photos the top options such as (exit, cut, T, and the drawing thingy appear at the same level of the notch which means I can’t use it. This only happens with WhatsApp for me and it’s been quite annoying to say the least.  I tried different things already.   I turned off and turned on my phone, I updated to the last version both my phone and WhatsApp (note: this problem has been going on before I update to the last iOS) I went on the support page and I didn’t quite find my problem so I came here as my last resource.

5,2021-01-30 02:17:34,"At first I should mention that, great job with whatsapp However, there are some improvements you can consider :  1. Being able to delete messages for both parties and deleted messages would disappear for both sides without leaving any traces  Also, being able to delete messages at anytime for the other person without time limit ( even after 12 hours, if the message is still unread )   2. Being able to edit messages, because misspelling is inevitable specially when you're in a hurry, So, instead of being able to edit the texts, we should delete the last one ( which by the way leaves traces in the first place ) and then we have to send another message correcting the last one, And this does not look good when you're texting people such as your professor or psychologist or supervisor or even your boss !!",Contemplating some improvements

It use to be where I am able to scroll up and down and choose the status I want not I have to scroll across and see a bunch of channels that I don’t even use. It would be nice to have the option to not view the channel section. It is ridiculous if I did not have family members in another country I would have deleted what’s app as it slowly makes no sense.

The UX has been kept so simple and utilitarian that I appreciate it almost every time I use the app.   That said, as an admin of a few groups, I have badly felt the need for better controls available for admins such as: 1) ability to mute a user for 30 mins or an hr, day, week etc 2) ability to delete posts in a group, at any time (currently only the one who posted a message can delete, and only if deleting with a few mins after posting) 3)ability to invite a user to the group by long press on phone number (right now I have to share the invite link or add the person to my contacts to invite to group)  These features can also help solve many issues being faced by WhatsApp in India, especially with incendiary fake news spreading like wold fire.

2,2021-08-27 01:53:02,Though I face many issues with WhatsApp on iPhone. But this one is a major headache. I get WhatsApp call and the phone keeps ringing and vibrating.

And the cherry on top is I will never get to know who tried to call me cause it does not get recorded on call history as well. Earlier it was a rare case scenario but recently it has been almost a daily occurrence. Today morning it happened continuously for all my 4-5 calls. That too on a time interval.

I did click on the block and report button on all the numbers which the death threats , extortion messages, and gruesome videos were being sent.

Whatsapp doesn’t allow you to forward a msg to multiple groups if the msg has already been forwarded multiple times before reaching you.

So if you think about doing the below mentioned workarounds, please be aware of what you are forwarding. If you are forwarding something that’s not right using the below workarounds, whatsapp can find you easily now than ever.  A easy way to get around this is, 1. If it is a msg, copy and paste it and create a new msg Id to it and then you can forward it multiple times. 2. If it is a media, download and forward it to multiple groups.

I’ve been a customer for a little under 6 months and I am (was) enjoying until a few annoying issues surfaced. First, the phone rang and I could receive calls; now it barely rings before just going to voicemail. Most times, it doesn’t ring at all; I just notice voicemails. With the Do Not Disturb activated in the app during non-business hours, calls go to voicemail. That’s great!! When Do Not Disturb is off, during business hours callers get my personal voicemail when I don’t answer. This  is NOW fine that I removed the standard greeting which was announcing my cell phone number. So, the only issue now is the phone not ringing at all and going to voicemail. Ughhhh!!!",Confusión

Sure it does have its perks like unloading and downloading videos and photos, but if it doesn’t work as well as iMessage it really is not worth it.

Very convenient to use and most effective even more than texting on regular text messaging now a days. The voice and video calling is superb and mostly gives you a 5 star quality calling. It makes for international calling easy without having to go through these most expensive phone companies to make such calls. On the whole it’s been most useful.,Jay on the beat

I had to restore my phone once because of what’s app. It told me to exit whatsapp and then my phone went on a bootloop. This issue happened twice with my sister where she had to restore her phone.

I cannot adjust my volume whatsoever on WhatsApp. I have to go out of the app to my iPhone home screen and turn it up or down. Pretty aggravating when you are in a quiet space and a personal voice note is coming thru on full blast and you can’t turn it down.🙄 Please fix this.

1,2019-02-07 04:04:00,"Many people in Mexico use whatsapp and with the updates it has most of the time become a better communication and sharing App. But this last update was the worse and it is a big step backwards limiting the communication to only 5 chats at a time. I understand that you are trying to avoid spam, but you are punishing good people also. If you need to reduce the spam why don't  reduce from 20 people to 10 because 5 is truly very restrictive. Also why it can't be installed on iPad and tablets ? If you want to make people happy let people install it and use it wherever they want. Maybe someone without a smart phone but with and old wired telephone can use its number and install whatsapp in a computer, iPod or tablet.

Or only contacts.  I would like it to be specific like the status you can chose “show to all contacts except... and select those contacts”.  Alternatively to be able to chose two pictures and select one as default (for all contacts) and one for specific people.,Needs new feature

2,2019-03-12 20:34:35,"Its a decent app, but the company itself could have one of the worst customer supports ever. The only way of contacting them is by email, and for a messaging company, its simply unacceptable that it takes so much time just to get a simple answer. No phone numbers, live chat, nothing. The second big problem is when you’re changing phones or moving to a different country, you are basically screwed since your contacts won’t have your new number. Those notifications they send to people so that they add your new number are close to useless since people just ignore those texts. Why can’t the contact info just update automatically?",Decent

But now it just shows up as “Message” and not the name of the person who sent the message and it’s bothering me!!

3,2023-09-23 03:28:25,WhatsApp is nice to use and is nice for international conversations.  Too frequently they decide to change something and then make your app invalid and useless.  Today fir example I used the app.  Maybe 15 minutes later I tried to use it again and was told that my app was outdated and I had to update the app to use it.  What if I am in a place with poor Internet service?  I would be out of luck.  They give you no warning.  They just invalidate your app whenever they want to.  The just outdated app was just a few months old!,Too frequently outdated

This is because literally not one person that I’ve interacted with via WhatsApp is a real individual. This app has to be the environment where more fraud, scams, and just fake lying catfish are operating than anywhere else. It blows my mind that this can even happen. Why has there not been verification requirements implemented?

Starting Feb 8th, Facebook will have access to a lot more information than WhatsApp ever collected included IP address, OS, and any links shared.

I’ve been using this app for around 9 years and the privacy of it just went on decline. Instead on focusing to make it a secure and reliable messaging platform, they added “improvements” that are insignificant to the basics of messaging.   One of the main issues of the update it’s the profile picture on the notification preview, making it not private at all like it used to be.  Unfortunately being forced to use it for the large amount of people who have it but slowly moving to a more secure and reliable messaging app.  Hope they make some more updates in the future to personalize the experience so we can choose how we want the platform to run, because clearly we’re not going back to the app we used to know back then",Not longer a messaging app

This was removed in your latest update. This is so inconvenient. Maybe your intention is for us to check WhatsApp every other minute but that’s not going to happen. Showing the new msg on muted chats (the way it used to work) is an industry standard and even iMessage works that way.

The other thing is that I think they should increase the capacity of the groups.  They could give options to organize your stickers and the ones you keep from someone else.

1,2021-01-12 13:22:17,"Apple introduced 14.3 including App Store privacy/permissions disclosure for user awareness purposes. FB takes an ad out bashing the decision bc “it hurts small business”.

Some backstory:  The creators of WhatsApp designed it with privacy and security in mind. When FB acquired it, the creators still had a role and insisted they keep the principle design in place. It held true to begin with but slowly the creators saw FB didn’t intend to honor that pledge and left (they had decision making power).   They are blurring the lines between their platforms FB, IG, and WhatsApp with the intention to make it easier to monetize our data by selling it to advertisers. It’s pitiful.

Ability for a group admin to remove or flag certain messages and/or users - sometimes in a community group, people will accidentally post messages and then try to delete but not chose the “delete for all” option.

I don’t receive notifications for social networking sites other than Snap so I can’t compare with a lot of other apps but the apps that I do grant access for, their notifications do not breakthrough DND. You guys need to fix that. It’s invasive. I shouldn’t have to turn off my phone to get good sleep. Especially since I still want my notifications but I just want them in silence during the night.

Video quality is not the best and you can be automatically into a group, without ur knowledge!! This is a security risk, and I highly advise the owners of WhatsApp do make that update, so the group admin can send you a group invite, and then, you can pick accepting or declining.

5,2020-05-03 13:18:12,"Hi. I really love this app, but one of my biggest struggles with it is storage space.  I know you have a few features to check which chats are consuming most space and clean them up, but most times it is challenging to clean them up, as you pretty much have to check and select them individually. So, I have a couple of recommendations for the Media, Links and Docs window: - Ability to filter between videos and pictures, since the first ones take the most space. - Ability to filter attachments that have been sent my me (or even a particular member of a group), so I can easily delete them and keep only what I have received. - Ability to sort by size. - Ability to select a range of attachments instead of having to tap on each one.

3,2018-03-03 18:11:01,The app works well but the reason for low rating is because notifications from the muted groups show up on the icon on the home screen. If makes me check the app 100 times in a day even though none of the chats I am interested in had a notification. There is a reason I muted those chats. I really wish they change this behavior or add an option for it in settings. This behavior was different on the windows phone.

They are so creative that they thought of both the present and future users of the App into consideration. The simplicity of it makes it easy for every class of people to use it with ease. The call feature is awesome as well as the video calling part of it which connect families and friends across the globe just in one click. Love it.,so easy and very simple

One issue I find a bit annoying is, even though a recipient phone is switched off, whatsapp call always returns ringing tone back.

Also when typing long messages, as soon as you move to the second line, the first line disappeared from view, you don't get to see all the message until you are on the third line or more, so inconvenient if you would want to review message before sending, more so since errors could not be corrected.

When I am on a call and another person tries to call me, it appears as the people that I will be on a call with are trying to call me and shows as I have a missed call from them. So for example I’m on a call with Mary, John and Kate and Andrew tries to call me, it will say missed call from Mary, John and Kate.  2.

I had read all of the instructions on what to do so I’ve uploaded the app again, I’ve restarted, I’ve reset the phone, I swiped off old WhatsApp from my screen and nothing works. It’s also impossible to get a hold of customer service, and when you do try to use their form to send a note that doesn’t fit one of their answers, there’s no way of sending the email.

Also, and this may be my fault since I’m a new user, but I cannot find for the LIFE OF ME where to turn off the notifications sound. This is soooo extremely annoying. I have turned off my phone ring and still this darn sound plays.  If you have someone who messages you all days many messages one after the other this is just inconvenient.

However I have a suggestion   I would like to make request to you for introducing a pause between the time user clicking the call button and the time the receiver gets the ringtone. Currently there is no time gap between the two. Sometimes the users accidentally click on the call buttons without intending to place the call. The receiver gets immediately notified. So if you can introduce a pause for 3-5 seconds or ask for confirmation it will be great.  This issue also occurs when the user browses the list of recent calls in WhatsApp app.  Would you please consider this request?

It was hours before finally on a whim I wondered if calling through an app would make a difference. I wasn’t expecting to find out that all along the business’s number was a what’s app line.    This should not be legal for 2 entities to have the same phone number. It was a day of annoyance for me but imagine the poor soul that actually has the phone number as their cell line.

One of the critical changes is that the archive is no longer easily viewable. Making sure the archive is viewable and contains real time updates was a brilliant feature and I very much miss it. There are plenty of use case scenarios where people use the archive and need the ability to access it with ease. I hope that will be restored.,Why change what wasn’t broken?

4,2021-09-04 22:23:17,I would have given this app a 5 star rating but it would be nice if WhatsApp would let us use our own notification tones and ringtones to be used on our contacts.

Why add a whole new screen for muted status? Why can I not simply scroll to the bottom (which is more intuitive btw)?  Why can I not batch select my status updates like before?

2,2019-12-02 16:38:28,The latest update with the “from Facebook” moniker in the settings page has changed the UI in subtle but very noticeable ways. This was an app that had the PERFECT UI. Usability was wonderful because of how much text and how many messages were packed into the main screen. Now the profile images are larger (than necessary) and there is less text viabile. And there seems to be more white space in general.   Please revert back so I can give you the 5 stars that you previously deserved,The new update makes the UI feel bloated

1,2019-02-26 11:12:46,The App works great but some improvements are needed to manage the messages received like a delete button next to a message so it can be easily deleted similar to the forward icon that appears today. Some groups just get out of control with media messages so the delete button will help to simply delete what is not needed. Another option will be swipe to the left to delete a message or picture similar to what email applications have. The icon is probably more convenient and should appear next to the message. Any message,Aditional controls needed

2,2023-09-26 19:50:16,I’ve used WhatsApp for many many years and it really has all the best features that other messaging apps don’t offer. The reason I’m disappointed is this new Channels feature.

It tries to reconnect on your end, but the person you’re speaking to has no issues, and vice versa. It doesn’t matter how much service or Wi-Fi you have, it still does it.

Also when statuses’ videos are loading with slow connection, the video will play horribly in slow motion while the video’s audio is still playing from ahead.","Dark mode needed, videos won’t load properly"

4,2018-02-01 16:47:05,"For the most part this app is really good. The call clarity is great, but sometimes it will just drop calls out of the blue and have the “beep beep” and it’s a bit frustrating when your in the middle of a conversation. But it’s a very good app to communicate with your loved ones over seas. But if you can’t afford to pay for the long distance charge you tolerate the beeping and just call back.",Great clarity on calls but drops sometimes

I would and do highly recommend this app to anyone and everyone!,Highly recommend!
4,2017-11-14 23:27:57,I just moved to this app from GroupMe for my group texting. I’m disappointing that there isn’t a feature that allows one to like a message of another.

1,2023-09-29 08:44:18,I updated WhatsApp and after that search bar option from chats has disappeared. This has made it unusable for me. Have complained multiple times on WhatsApp chat support but since then there have been two updates without the problem being corrected. This User Interface problem seems to be there on the older devices such as mine iPhone 6 Plus running on iOS 12. The same issue is also there in WhatsApp business. Very disappointed!,Search bar in chats has gone missing
4,2023-09-26 14:59:01,WhatsApp is a great tool for international communication. I wish there was a “ringer off” option so that WhatsApp “phone” calls do not ring while driving. WhatsApp ringers bypass the ringer off of my iPhone and my only solutions have been airplane mode or blocking frequent callers.

Everything else is just downhill - stories, communities (whatever that is), and everything else just adds more unnecessary bulk to something that was great already.  The cherry on top is the lack of new notification sounds from iOS 17. I personally like the new quieter ones, but WhatsApp isn't using them yet and is sticking to the default ""Note"" sound.

4,2019-12-13 02:05:43,You are going to like WhatsApp very much when I had a Samsung I had to always FaceTime on WhatsApp. It wouldn’t be the best I could say but always got me through my calls. I would have to show my sister stuff but it wouldn’t show that well so I would have to take a picture of it. That’s the only bad part. The good part is that it would always get me through my call,WhatsApp adventures
5,2019-05-09 12:17:06,WhatsApp is an amazing app platform but the only thing I’d fix is a bug I picked up on IOS.

1,2021-11-19 20:26:30,WhatsApp needs to allow users to block calls from people not in their contact list on the iPhone. Apple also needs to stop allowing WhatsApp call logs mixing in with normal phone logs. Users also should be given an option to set a different ring tone for WhatsApp calls. Scammers are taking advantage of these lack of options and exploiting this problem and using it into trick people into thinking they are calling from legitimate business numbers.,call logs and calls from unknown numbers

Title says it all. I’ve seen the same release notes for at least 3 updated versions running, and as a long-time user, find this behavior insulting. Not all of your user-base are too dense to grasp tech speak, so play straight with us as to exactly what fixes are implemented per update, apart from  a build number.","Your release notes regarding updates are insulting, and lazy."
3,2019-11-06 15:52:35,While my iPhone is on “Do NotDisturb” calls will still come through. This is very dangerous considering I could be driving and suddenly I’ll see on my screen that someone is trying to call me. Please fix this. Whatsapp needs to follow the same rules of not allowing calls to go through the same why the iPhone doesn’t allow for calls to come though while on “Do Not Disturb”,Calls come through while on DO NOT DISTURB

5,2019-04-10 16:03:16,Excellent program but the restrictions of 5 is painful. You can’t forward to Broadcast list too of course to a group you can.

2,2018-09-20 21:39:47,Before FB bought it this app was great. Since then every other update brings a few fresh bugs.   I would gladly skip some of the unnecessary new features to ensure that basic functionality does not get broken so often with new releases. Right now I can’t control playing a simple voice message - I can’t skip back or forward within the message.

5,2018-03-11 09:47:30,WhatsApp is amazing! But I constantly find myself blueticking people to tell them I don't like them. But some people just can't take a hint.

But the amount of storage capacity it uses for normal functioning is crazy, therefore you frequently end up with it asking you to delete tons of GB in order for the app to restore text, media, etc.  You could have 40GB available in your phone and WhatsApp tells you have to delete 25GB to be able to update / restore/etc",Mixed feelings

It's not clear why there has to be a difference. Worse, there are no options for how you want to configure.   - You have to go into a profile to view starred messages instead of having those as part of the main interface.

I think you should work on an upgrade where people get to choose whose status they’d like to see or not without blocking them separately from the ones muted. A clearer understanding of the point I’m making is there should be a feature where I get to block and unblock myself from viewing someone’s status just like I can block them from viewing mine.

1,2021-03-06 15:56:48,My phone WAS jailbroken. And then I unjailbroke it because it was slow. The app worked fine until the latest update where it says it doesn’t support jailbroken phones even though my phone is not jailbroken anymore. It asks me to give my phone a factory reset which I don’t want to do so I just use other apps such as Viber or Signal.,Doesn’t work

1,2021-01-14 00:42:01,My family and I are not liking how WhatsApp is going to share its users info to Facebook. We’ve had WhatsApp for a really really long time before when Facebook even bought WhatsApp in 2014. So it does break our hearts to see how us users mean nothing to WhatsApp even long term users. Anyway I suggest everyone to download and move over to TELEGRAM it’s much trust worthy and worth downloading.,Goodbye
1,2021-01-10 13:10:51,In case you didn’t know Facebook owns this app.  Now We’ve  found out just how facist and controlling this company is.  Booting and banning users whose opinions they don’t agree with.  So my suggestion is remove all their apps from your devices.  Try other apps to replace them - signal and telegram are much better alternatives.  Just as Facebook bans and censors its users - ban and censor Facebook from your devices.,Dump this app as soon as possible

People think they’re so important and that I have to reply to them right away, so whenever I don’t reply instantly, they call me to make sure I give them attention. It’s so annoying.

Also, can we have a better video player? Trying to rewind 5 or 10 seconds is such a painful experience.",BLOCK CALLS! And better video player.

2,2022-05-26 12:39:40,When you delete a message every body in a chat can see it!! ( deleted message!!) you only can open and see one message at the time but at telegram you can see multiple message at the same time!   What’s up Needs so much space and if you need more space you should delete all of the videos and photos… then you will lose them for good.  But in telegram you just need to delete cache  And always have access to all the deleted messages in Cloud.  Telegram has more security than what’s up,Still needs lot of improvement!
