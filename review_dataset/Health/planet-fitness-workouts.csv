4,2021-07-16 20:24:53,"Having just joined Planet Fitness the other day I have now had the chance to take its app for a test run - so to speak. The app itself is very helpful for a complete newbie such as myself. I appreciate the ability to see how the different machines work via videos found by using QR codes on the machines. I also like the ability to use the membership card on the app - though, for some reason I’ve got to figure, it does not work on my Apple Watch.   The one place I really, really hope the app developers fix is the ability to add the exercises one engages in. For example: today I did arm curls, bicep curls, front fly, chest press, hammer curl, and up/down/oblique abdominals. Not a single one of these exercise are listed in the “add an activity” section of the app. Why on earth wouldn’t you have each machine you have in your gym listed on your app? Please consider adding in the ability to list the machines used, the weights used, and time spent (or even reps) along with the other information you allow currently.   Being able to add these is will more accurately reflect my actual “mins of exercise”, “activities this week”, “calories burned”, and “mins per active day”.","Good, but could be better."
5,2018-08-15 00:17:35,"I love Planet Fitness, I just recently joined and had been a 24 hour Fitness member for a while but hated going because the lack of equipment due to always being hogged up by body builders. I would go try to work out and they just stand there staring at you and kept asking if I was done, when I had just gotten the equipment after waiting my turn. Planet Fitness has tons of equipment TONS and there’s always something available to do. Not to mention the levels of membership ranging from $10, $12 and $21 which is the Black Card Membership that allows me to use the gym on my way home from work and the one by my house on the weekends. Plus not only that but the Black Card Room with tanning booths, total body enhancing booth and hydro massage with massage chairs. I love it, there are no pushy trainers,  No body builders, just average me and average others who have the same goals in mind, lose weight and get healthy. Would I recommend Planet Fitness to those who are intimidated by the big gym, yes I would. The only thing I miss is Body Pump class but I remedied that with my own body pump setup at home. The staff is nice and everyone has to wipe down their equipment after use with cleaner provided every where, even Monk would be impressed. Thank you Planet for catering to people like us.",Planet Does Us Right
1,2019-08-18 21:43:50,"As a developer myself, I feel really bad reading the reviews here, as I can tell a lot of work was put into updating the design of this app. However the reason I came here is to see if anyone else had written about how to properly log a photo of my TREADMILL workout, literally the most common cardio machine at any gym. Unbelievably, my worst fear confirmed, the app no longer has the “treadmill” option, and they have also “discontinued” the snap a workout feature. That feature was so helpful for me tracking my fitness history.   But ok, I have to enter manually now, I could reluctantly accept that. Then I learned that to add insult to injury, you can only use the “walking” option as the closest thing to treadmill, and there you can only log your speed and minutes, not your calories or incline. From reading reviews, I learned the super buried feature where if you enter your height and weight, it will calculate the calories, however without the incline info, the calculation is way off.   Friends, I feel bad saying this but this update is *terrible* — I have never regretted updating an app on this level. The old version was ugly, but it was super useful, and i used it a lot for a very important part of my life. The new version is useless to me. I have been an iphone user since 2008, and I this is the first time i can remember writing any app review. I can only hope you can work quickly to restore needed features to your paying customers.",Xcapture replacement is terrible
4,2019-02-28 02:56:05,"I like this app because it fits the gym.  It doesn’t fit every gym, nor ever kind of training.  It fits the judgement free zone, mostly machine gym and the kind of lifting that goes on there.  It has videos built in to explain things.  It lets you log and record your progress.  You can take a picture of the elliptical, treadmill, or bike screen and it will log the numbers for you.  You can post your workouts to social media and link it to a variety of other apps.  Post a picture to their success stories section and you might win a TV.  I have my membership card linked to it, so it scans from the app and I don’t have to carry the card.  This is handy for everything from buying a drink to reserving a massage chair.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was Planet Fitness’s 30 Minute Express workout.  I like the workout.  The app has videos for all of it.  The app won’t log the workout.  You can select “yard work” as an exercise, but you can’t select Planet Fitness’s proprietary workout on their app.  That’s just annoying.",Works well
1,2021-07-13 16:54:48,"Where to start?  I only use this app to check into the gym and since it isn’t optimized even the slightest it takes forever to even load and you have several screens to go through just to get to your “keychain” login.  You can park furthest away in the parking lot and start trying to load the second you leave your car and it still won’t get to it by the time you reach the front desk.  Also, it dumbly needs an internet connection where they could have made your keychain static and the approval for it go through the front desk computers when you scan in.  But noooo it has to be the slow and hard way.   And on top of that the terrible WiFi provided by the gym logs you out constantly so if you show up to start your workout and you get close enough to the gym to grab their WiFi it blocks your keychain from loading as you’re on the WiFi but not connected to the internet because you have to sign in over and over every single time.  So you have to either forget their network every time or go through their even slower sign in process just to not be interrupted while trying to access your keychain all so you can just scan in to begin your workout.  Ridiculous.  Atrocious setup.  Negative stars for this app and the geniuses who came up with this 1990 AOL level sign on process.","Terrible, terrible, terrible app"
1,2023-08-25 02:06:21,They have signs all over the store saying “Cancel Anytime!” That is a joke. I registered my account out of stat while at college and was a black card member. I went back home and just used the sign in sheet because I was “out of town”. I tried to cancel my membership at home right before vacation and the guy working had no idea how to help. He said he had no idea how to cancel it and had no idea how to transfer me to that location to cancel it. He called the manager and still couldn’t figure it out. He said to come back in the next day and cancel but I couldn’t because I was going on vacation and he then said to call my home gym and try to cancel. I called while on vacation and they guy at my home gym said he had no idea how to transfer me and couldn’t cancel my membership over the phone. So the pay period for the month I wanted to cancel passed and I was charged because of the ignorance of the workers. I am going back to college and tried to cancel again and the guy took forever to be able to transfer me then I finally was able to cancel. Such garbage when a company can’t figure out how to cancel an account and also refuses to let you cancel on the phone when you can sign up and give them money without ever needing to enter the stupid place. 0/10 please find anywhere else to go to the gym.,Scam
1,2021-09-11 11:42:54,"Joined about 3 months ago. Super equipment, very clean, and never too crowded. Love the experience at the gym. Pros - it will track when I’ve checked into the gym - it will generate a QR that allows me to check in at the desk Cons - it wont display utilization of the PF black card amenities such as tanning booth, massage chairs, etc… - it wont record my activity without me manually entering the information - it doesn't interface with the Activity App on my iPhone (which will automatically record my activity) - the apple watch’s PF app functionality is worthless, doesn't work for check-in, and gives me a message to have my iPhone in close proximity. (I have a cellular enabled apple watch and would like to not have to carry my iPhone into the gym). I received the following response to this review. Really makes me wonder if the developer really knows what they are doing. There is a PF app that installs on my watch with the installation of the PF app on my iPhone.    Dear THOMAS, Planet Fitness Holdings, LLC responded to your review of Planet Fitness Workouts Planet Fitness Holdings, LLC ""Thank you for sharing this with us!

5,2019-09-10 15:59:02,"Before the recent update I felt very meh with this app, it’s only purpose to me was seeing the class schedule and having my card on it. But since the update I find myself using it very often!! It’s so much nicer to log your activities and it now has exercises you can do based on level and muscle group which is incredible. Only thing I would want to change is the variety in the exercises section. A lot of the exercises involve TRX bands, kettlebells, or ropes and my planet fitness doesn’t have those, even if they did some exercises require all of them and I wouldn’t want to take that much equipment. It would also be nice if you could search through those workouts and just search “core” and those would come up. I’d also love for more exercises to be included in the activities section and for you to be able to adjust your level and calories manually, the app often says I burned less calories than what the machine says. Other than those few things the app is 10x better than it used to be!",Good job developers!!!

5,2018-02-27 23:46:26,"The app is great and a useful tool but what’s really impressive is the gym. I mean you gotta work out for the app to be useful right?  Planet fitness is a great place to come work out. It’s got plenty of room so you have space to work out instead of feeling cramped. They have a huge amount of cardio machines so you’re never waiting for one to free up, which is one of my favorite parts. They have this cool area that’s kinda for people who aren’t sure what to do during a workout, you just follow the routine and you’re set. It’s also great for people who don’t have a lot of time to workout. My favorite part is the “ Black Card Spa” area. There are massage chairs and beds, a tanning booth, and also body enhancement machines. Cool part of being a black card member is that you’re able to bring anyone at any time for free, and it’s still cheaper than any other gym around. ($20 a month for black card, plus they’re always having specials.) Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a chill and cheap gym.",Great gym/app
4,2023-03-12 10:37:31,"I love the gym here, but the app is useless to me. The key tag for the Apple Watch dose not work at all and within the app should go with the workout you do for a plan. It would be nice to open the app say I want to increase muscle index, loose weight, or even yoga and automatically come up with a schedule of how many reps weight and set goals without watching a video, according to your weight height and level you choose.   At home or in gym and again with the watch please include this to Apple Watch with time frames and plans it would be much better then a video that you can barely see when your at the gym all you have is a 2x5” screen nothing to connect too and a million other ppl around. Also like Dunkin’ Donuts or gas stations apps should be points to encourage more time at the gym for a free shirt towels drinks etc instead of discounts only to a lot of places most people don’t care for. Setting goals and point system would be nice",Planet fitness
3,2019-12-24 21:48:56,"App looks really nice but they dropped the ability to effectively track workouts. I loved the xCaputure feature as it made logging information from treadmills and other PF equipment a snap. If you had to manually input the work out it was no real issue.  With the current app workout tracking has effectively been eliminated. Not sure if that is the intent or if they are planning on rolling out updates as the new platform rolls out? The lack of clarity of whats to come makes it feel like the users are not apart of the cycle of development. Its basically come back time to time to see what we have done and hope you figure how to make it work.  I need the app now for one reason, to show my membership. Everything else is just to attract people into the membership, no one is working out to the app, ever. If you could help track fitness progress as previously had with the clunky versions then there would be some value but it has been lost with the updates.

1,2019-11-05 19:59:28,"I agree with the August 2019 developer-reviewer who complained about the loss of features. The treadmill is missing. We don’t need a general exercise app recording our walking, biking, karate times and calorie burns. We need each device in the PF gym and the ability to track our chair settings, weights, repetitions, calories, times, etc, etc. I use the elliptical trainer, from which the app allows me to record only my time and calories burned. Hills, fat burn, levels, etc? Nope. I do weight machines and can’t track any of that. Did I lift 50 lbs last week? Should I raise the weight to 60 lbs, but I might have already done that? What’s the seat setting again? It’s nice that you’ve provided instructional videos for workouts. Really it is. And the app is pretty. But it should support your customers in their gym routines first and foremost. Not exercise mat routines I could do at home. Your gyms should also have functional wifi. I often can’t record my exercises in the app because the wifi signal is unavailable. Mind you I have been listening to online music but the PF app fails to connect. What’s up with that? I’m disappointed with your app. I don’t see that you’ve fixed anything since August btw.",Pretty Useless
4,2020-09-19 06:36:56,"My only wish is that there would be a way to create and save workouts you currently are doing and workouts you are planning to build yourself into later. It would be nice to simply select the machines and various workouts listed in the workout section and create a list, along with the sets and repetition rages. For someone like me, until I learn all of the gym equipment by heart, it helps to have a visual guide as to what order or what machine I am supposed to be using, as I have a specific plan based on my medical conditions, and can’t remember the equipment very well. It limits my ability to utilize just any machine. A feature like that would really help me keep a routine with what I am doing and plan out with a trainer what changes I should graduate into down the road.   Please, please, PLEASE create features like this so I can reference a plan directly on my phone. I do love the videos along with the workouts that show you how to properly use the equipment.","Simple, works well."

I fully understand that PF is doing the correct thing until all this blows over. Now, I am quite impressed with Planet Fitness and all the newer equipment and environment within! I am however wondering why there is no scale to weigh yourself on? I have been a fitness club member at other gyms around the USA and they all had a body weight scale. I do like to weigh myself on an accurate scale other than the junk we have in our bathrooms at home. Therefore, only 4 stars because I want a scale at my PF.

Kevin M, the trainer is very knowledgeable on what types of exercises would be best for each person he meets. He has a great attitude and has given me so many good tips about the equipment. The Design Your Own Program is another added benefit which allows Kevin to customize the workout to your own goals. I didn’t know what to expect when I signed up. So glad I did now!  The app (using iPhone) not only stores your card so you don’t have to carry it with you, but it makes it very easy to see and schedule all the classes available.

The calendar of events tab might be useful to people looking for classes to participate in but what I’m really annoyed about is the fitness log.   They took the fitness log from the previous version and downgraded it. No more uploaded pictures of the machine you used. The app only wants to know how long you were on the machine and at what intensity you feel you worked. A couple exercises allow you to input a more realistic metric here (like miles per hour for running) but most are vague and useless in terms of calculating any kind of calorie burn or whatever other goal you have set for yourself.   Until they actually take their app seriously, I recommend using something else.   Suggestions for improvement, CAPTURE THE METRICS FROM THE MACHINE, no brainer right? People aren’t coming to Planet Fitness to play lacrosse or ice hockey (they are in the list of activities, not kidding) so remove the fluff from your list. Lastly, add a general food diary. It doesn’t have to be super complicated with a massive collection of foods to search, just make it so foods can be added and saved to be easily used again later. People going to the gym often pay attention to this stuff and are willing to eat the same things regularly to see the gains they want.

Planet fitness is merely a place to hang out and pretend your working out. What I find really funny is the training coaches in the app. In order to look like the Main guy in their introduction video you would need to conduct workouts that would violate their policies. Heaven forbid you start pushing some weight that makes you grunt….. violation. Drop a weight at the end of a set….. violation.

I signed up without having the in person tour so I was surprised when I found out there was no bench press or squat racks or any free bar weights of any kind really. I also had problems with the gym being packed most of the time with the exceptions of Friday nights and weekends which every gym usually empties out on.   The final thing that got me is that I found out I have access to a program called active fit through USAA because I’m a service member. That plan allows my to pick 5 gyms for $25 a month so I went with that and needed to cancel my member ship as I would still have planet fitness through the new program. I searched the app and searched online and couldn’t find any way to cancel. I called and was told I would have to come in to switch my membership to the active fit account or to cancel. I find it very annoying that I can sign up online at home but have to come into the store in person to cancel. I see that as shady tactics designed to prevent you from canceling or to make it difficult so they get you for a few more billing cycles. Either way I think I’ll be moving forward with a different gym and I encourage everyone else to do the same.

TWO new version doesn’t let u sign on w finger print like the old version u have to manually sign in and out each time so 5 years ago!  THREE and the one that bothers me the most is the old version had a section to show all ur check-ins this one does not.

The point of an APP is to have all the information you can get from online AND that info WAS available on the older version. 🙄😒,WARNING: Don’t update KEEP the current version
4,2022-06-22 00:46:40,"I’m a lifelong athlete, but a newbie to gyms. Planet Fitness has been a fantastic experience and has motivated me to continue my fitness journey, but the app could use a tweak.  My only complaint is that the Activity Tracker does not have the actual gym equipment and gym exercises listed, apart from cardio. For a perfect app and experience, I would appreciate if the developers would consider adding the machine workouts to the list of activities. This would create a more accurate “mins of exercise,” and would more accurately account for burned calories. Personally, I know that I would be much more motivated to work out and hit burned calorie goals if the app registered every available gym machine.   Overall, the app and gym experience are fantastic, but one change in the app would create a huge difference, and earn a perfect five star review.","Awesome, but needs one change."

Updated the app before I went to the gym at 4am to avoid the crowds. Once there, I could not enter activities, and once at the workout screen, could not leave it without closing the app for awhile. I restarted iPhone twice, then deleted and re-uploaded app from App Store. Still not working.  I have generally really appreciated the app for what it does do, although it’s definitely lacking. Cannot track weights progression. Running speeds are only measured as whole numbers—no decimal—so also no tracking progression or intensity. No PF30 tracking or HIIT or other circuit or interval training tracking. And the crowd meter baffles me... It seems like one tick line equals around 5 people??",Last update bugs? (Updated)

I have tried every tip online, I have a new phone, new everything and the app still will not work. The problem that creates for me is about to force me to cancel my membership as I’m getting “bullied” at the gym because my app won’t work. The front desk staff has been less than nice regarding this. On several occasions I have had a staff member act as if I’m trying to sneak in even though he is looking me up on their computers he has even told me that it’s user error and that I’m the only person that is having an issue. PF is supposed to be a judgement free zone but I have felt nothing but judged because my app won’t work. I requested a key chain check in card and was told that’s no longer an option so, what do I do if my app will not work and I’m ridiculed when someone has to manually look me up. ?  *the latest version does not work either .",App will not work
1,2023-04-05 19:28:13,"The so-called crowd meter provided in this app is utterly useless. It does not show how busy the gym is at a given moment. It’s actually unclear what exactly it does show. The fine print says something about the meter being based on historical information, but frankly, that’s completely useless. What’s more, even the front desk employees can’t seem to explain the meter and are quick to tell you that it’s not at all accurate. So what’s the point?? Basically, Google does a FAR better job of telling you how busy the gym is at any point in time. Yet Planet Fitness has the actual hard data and can’t be bothered to provide its paying customers with that information. Unreal. I recently signed up for a one-year agreement but will likely be canceling very soon. I’m underwhelmed by the app and PFs unwillingness to provide information, and the gym itself leaves much to be desired (Somerset, NJ location has far too many broken machines etc. and less than ideal hours of operation).",Inaccurate Crowd Meter

The front desk makes a note in your acct that you were “not fully checked in” and missing points, but you never get them. Moreover, Perksville never responds to concerns. Their auto-reply only states that they are experiencing high volume, so if you lose points, it will never resolve.   I spent two hours in club, weightlifting, treadmill, and massage. I checked into the club AND the massage table, and not one check-in registered my presence in club or awarded my 5 points! Yeah, I get my workout, but I want my t-shirts! Incentive programs need to work. I am Black Card member and can appreciate the cost of PF as compared to other gyms, but I have a free gym option on the AF Base that has a cardio room and a weight room with power racks. In PF, I am paying for convenience and the “brand” to work.  Call me lame, but perks often compel me to stop by the gym and “actively” recover.  Please debug your Perks.",Perks Points Buggy

I’ve been using the app for over a year and have had the SAME email address! I’ve even gotten emails from Planet Fitness from said email address!! I went the route of signing up for an account, since I had given up hope of tryin to save my progress, only to get a message there was an account already created with my email address. 😡😡😡  I then get a message that says I will get an email to help me set up for the new stuff & login with the app. I NEVER GOT THE EMAIL!

I tried my old barcode from another location b4 I transfer and the new one. Nothing worked.  I really like the app bc it’s helping to track my exercise and works with my Fitbit too. I don’t know whoever approved this update to launch but they need to make sure that an app is going to work b4 you push an  update to the masses.  UPDATE Got a response from the developer I needed to go to the gym for assistance with adding my barcode.

For instance, if you try to go in and update your profile the app will bring up the keyboard for only a select few fields and when you try to save it won’t saying that fields are missing... that is if you can get the save button to actually register. This app is extremely buggy and the fact that it hasn’t been updated in over a year and looks like it was designed for the iPhone 4 also is a huge letdown...

3,2023-05-04 23:32:56,I only use the app for 2 things. Scanning in and checking how crowded it is going to be. The crowd meter is very deceitful. It will have 2 bars signifying that it should basically be dead and I will go and barely be able to workout because it is so crowded. I assume it is based if a % of capacity but if that is the case I assume the capacity is at a default setting for every gym with no regard for the size of the actual gym someone is going to. Honestly each gym should have their own capacity based on pieces of equipment they have and then divide the people there by the total equipment. If I have multiple Time slots a could go to the gym and when I check and it says it’s empty I will go. Then when I actually go and it crowded it hurts. I already put in the time to go. My workout is now going to suffer. Most people may get discouraged by that and eventually stop going,Needs work

This could be remedied if it let you book farther in advance. That being said, if you call in, the front desk is more then happy to book for you but it’s difficult to plan your week without being able to see what classes fall in what time slots, because they switch up from what time the classes are offered. Please PF at least give the App the ability to book out the classes two weeks in advance or add an additional trainer and classes.

I like that there is a list and instructions of exercises and a list of trackable activities. The problem is, the exercises are not all on the list of activities. I want to track my reps, sets and weight on the chest press for instance so I don’t have to use the 3rd party app anymore or keep notes, but that exercise is not available on the list of activities. This and an option to create personal workouts based on available exercises would be golden. I read the earlier reviews so I’m patiently waiting for Apple Watch integration.

They’ll ask about your operating system, if you have a  VPN (and if it’s on), if you tried re-download it, and uninstalling it, and if your operating systems up-to-date. All that is true for me and they still don’t know what’s wrong with it. I continually get messages like “I will get back to you soon” and it will be weeks later until I have to contact them and start the process all over again.  they had me repeatedly say that I can get support in the app which isn’t true since I can’t actually get to the screen where support is an option.

I also liked being able to uploaded my aerobic workout into the app. There were times when it didn’t record and I think that was due to the sunlight/glare.

Normally, I would be okay with this response, but after giving nearly all my personal information along with the local club I visited, I was told the reply would be from a member of member services.

1,2021-07-10 08:33:58,First let me say that I’ve been a member for over ten years. Probably like 12-15. Anyway I was “grandfathered” into the old price so as long as I don’t cancel it stays the same which I love PF for doing.   Planet fitness re started my membership after the pandemic without even notifying me. I didn’t agree to it. I was charged for two months before I found out.   Other apps  had me click the link when I was ready to start my post pandemic subscription again. This GUARANTEES that I’m okay with the charges. Planet fitness just starts taking money out of my account without telling me.   When I called the guy told me “sorry but we got your money now”. And chuckles. That made me furious.  He told me to I have to come in to cancel my membership which I didn’t wanna do. So I never came in to cancel but he cancelled it anyway. Then when I go to work out they said he wrote that I was a “rude customer” in their notes.  There’s a blink fitness that just opened up next to my house… they are quoting the PF guy on the phone now. “Sorry but we(blink) got your(my gym membership money)money now”.

Their canned replies here seem just to make it appear they are listening.   ORIGINAL: The newest version of the app took away the one thing I was actually using it for, tracking distances of my various workouts.   Now when you record a workout all you are entering is the time. There is no field to enter distance. So all the entries I had for the entire year, leading up to when it silently updated on my phone are now lost.   Additionally, when you do enter the time of your workout, it defaults the Calories calculation (which is ALWAYS much lower than what the specific machine calculated) but no longer gives you a way to override the calculation. Previously you could override it with what was displayed on the machine.   Also there is no way to see summaries of previous months/year to date/... beyond the current month (August as of this review).   Because of this change the only thing I will prob end up using the app for is to display my ID card to get in the door.

Also, I can’t even transfer my membership to a new gym for another 60 days, because you have to have been a member for 90 days in order to transfer.

Tons of 1 star reviews lately and angry customers say it all.  I just hope someone important at Planet Fitness is paying attention to the their unhappy customers, because it is clearly obvious the redesigned app was created by people who don’t  value customer feedback, customer service, ease of use and the ability to capture workout data.  This new app make me think it was created by people who never stepped one foot into a gym.  Nor did they think it was important to seek out the opinion of the folks who do.  The post release tech support has been nothing but insulting to the customer as well.

I am fully aware that for the scanning in process, screen brightness being at a max can alleviate a lot of problems - I get it. But this app doesn’t let go of the screen brightness after you exit the app. Your screen will remain at a battery draining, heat inducing level – until you swipe completely out of the app after you’ve checked in. I use all the various airline apps for the same purpose, and they all let go of my screen brightness immediately after I close the app. This seems like a simple adjustment for the developers to make. Otherwise it’s a solid app for how I use it.",Screen Brightness Stays Maxed out!

After this happened, I immediately wrote the support email to cancel this action and I was told that I would have to physically go in to the branch to have to work this out. It’s not that I don’t want the upgrade, it’s just that I don’t want it right now and I should be able to explore the app. Instead I clicked on the button and was automatically upgraded without asking for confirmation.

They have tons of equipment to use and everyone is in there zone so you won’t get interrupted during your workout routine.  Cons: 1. A few of my friends are interested in this summer pass but find it irritating they can only work at one planet fitness location. So I can’t work out with half of my friends bc of this rule. :(  2. The planet fitness app is very helpful except for one thing that I wish they could improve. When it shows you the different workouts you can choose from. I wish there was a section where you could save a few workouts for your personal workout routine and always come back to them instead of searching them up over and over again.",PROS AND CONS!

I love the additional features they added to the app. It would be nice to either add back the feature to snap record a workout or evaluate how the current model records workouts. Example: I run on a treadmill for 3 miles for a total time of 33 minutes. The app should generate an average speed according to those values. It currently has you fill in a generic speed which either over or understates the workout. Also it would be a great add to have sub columns in weightlifting, ie arms, legs, chest, core...& you can have subcategories even on those for a complete workout history.

They had to email me a password reset which apparently was done to all previous app users and the reset email took forever! I got so upset at with all this I just deleted it.

The app says that most workouts will within an hour, but I have yet to see one that shows up in my history in less than 24. 3) How is it possible that there is no option for ""Snow Shoveling"" when manually entering a workout?

2,2022-05-12 02:04:37,What I find lacking in this app is the ability to customize it and track my individual routines. There is a nice section showing you how to use each machine but you are unlikely to use most of them. And there is a section with their canned routines. But sometimes you are recovering from an injury and need to customize your routine. I’d love to see the following enhancements made to make the app more interactive and practical.   1) there is a great section showing how to us all the machines but you probably won’t be using most of them and it takes a while to scroll through them. Would love to be able to mark the ones the trainers set me up with on my first day so could quickly find them. Instead the trainer gave me a sheet of paper ripped out of a notebook. Seems silly to carry around a raggedy sheet of paper when the application could do it.   2) it would then be nice to group those favorites into separate workouts. (I.e.  upper body vs legs)  3) for each machine it should allow you to track weight and seat settings. Ideally you could track a history of weight used to watch your progress.,This app could be so much more

Given how often the xCapture fails, I'd like to still be able to record my treadmill workout as ""treadmill"" rather than walking/running. 3) Add in an option of 30 Minute Express.

I contacted planet fitness and they told me they can’t do anything because it’s a Planet Fitness franchise and I’d have to go through the CEO.  Very shady.

The place is super clean, tons of equipment (no waiting), fun classes (free), etc. The app allows you to sign up or cancel classes and puts it directly on your calendar; there are short training videos, and you can pay PT bills or buy on line PT merchandise (which I’m not interested it) . A great feature is that it can sync with fit bit or my fitness pal, the two other apps I use. Mostly, I use it to check the group fitness schedule and sign up for classes rather than calling. Very convenient .",At Home Here!
4,2021-05-03 14:33:15,Good app but let’s be honest. I only ever use this to check in and nothing else. It’s interesting that the most used feature is in the top right hand corner which means I have to use two hands or carefully move my hand/thumb to the top then back to the bottom again to accept the notice. Can you please move the check in function to the bottom?  Put account info on top right. Think out how people are holding their phones when they walk in to the gym. Not from the top. I have dropped my phone a number of times trying to check it quickly.,Solid app

I enjoy finding new exercises to add to my workouts and that the app has animations so I can ensure I’m doing them with correct form. However, I feel like this feature could be improved if I was able to “create a workout” and add these exercises to a personalized workout plan. I also wish there was a feature that dove deeper into my goals and progress. I know you can adjust these details on the app, but it doesn’t really show you the progress you’ve made or give you tips on better ways to achieve the goal you’re striving for.","Like the app, but there could be more"

Currently at the end of the month the data goes away and a new month is posted. I simply would like to see what I’ve done in previous months to compare progress. I’ve been taking a screenshot of the page and referencing that. I thought there should be a better way to accomplish this is. The reply I received had absolutely nothing to do with the question. It appeared to be a canned answer. No help at all. The app isn’t bad but support could be better. Just tell me “no” if you can’t help.,Support

I thought this was pretty shocking for a gym. Second, there was a lunk alert sign that claimed if you came into the gym with a gallon water you are a lunk and they would sound an alarm. Seems like a pretty backwards idea for a “judgement free zone” especially regarding someone who is trying to drink a healthy amount of water. It also claimed that wearing a tank top is also a lunk which seemed to be very judgmental for a place that promotes the opposite. I understand the statement about slamming weights to a degree but after all it’s a gym not a library.

I suggest making it so when someone scans a machine they can enter how much weight they use and how many lifts they do with that machine. Also, the sechdule for the gym you're currently at.

I'm going old school paper and pencil ✏️  CAN WE PLEASE UPGRADE TO THE 21st CENTRY PLEASE! So much for Planet Fitness and their carbon footprint! I'm still using tree to document my workout 🤦‍♂️ it's ridiculous! It's more costly to use paper! Not to mention bad for the PLANET Earth 🌏,The app is crap 💩
2,2022-07-20 14:25:13,"3 weeks ago, before the latest “bug” fixes the app was working fairly well. Now that the “fixes” are in place, nothing works. Can’t launch the app, can’t log in.

I’ve tried restarting my iPhone 13, deleting and reinstalling the app, shutting off VPN, access via wi-fi as well as over the air network. All to no avail.

I would have done this in person but of course I got COVID. The next day my account was charged even though I had $0. So now I am negative. I called PF and they said to come in (it was fine if a wore a mask- lol) and they can reverse the charge. Well turns out they CAN’T reverse the charge. I’m so unbelievably annoyed!!!!!!!!

I go into the app, open then delete the “offers”, it says I have no messages in my inbox. Yet the app continues to notify me that I have unread messages in the app, if I close and reopen the app, the offers and messages are back no matter how many times I delete them.

5,2022-06-15 15:56:54,So first I wanted to say that this app is great as an employee of PF this app is super easy to navigate And has all the information that you need right at your finger tips.   I do have two suggestions that I think would make the app easier to use.   1) have a way to check into the club via the mobile app I know there is remote check in but even for your home club make it so members can already be signed in before they get there. Skip the desk right to the fun :)   2) have an option to sign up for any amenities in the black card spa area on the app a lot of people don’t like the fact that they have to come up pick a time then we have to confirm it and tell them which number they have it would make it easier for everyone.

It could be way cooler though if there were a calendar feature that showed which days you checked in, allowed you to plan for gym days, and had any classes/special events on it that you can click and sign up for. Another cool feature could be to add a social forum of sorts for people who attend that gym can message/help/encourage each other to show up. Just a thought. The app is kinda just boring as is.",There should be a calendar feature
1,2019-08-21 19:54:44,I seriously regret updating.  PF decided to go with pretty over function. The new app is no longer associated with what is in the gym and is now trying to be a more general fitness app.  In the process features like “snap-a-workout” or even just accurately tracking walking on a treadmill has been lost.  What a terrible move by PF to ruin what they had.  The common refrain from the developers is either go online or that has been discontinued.  Both of which scream “we elected to make the App less useful”.  Further the update history clearly shows the deployment of this version was rushed and not fully tested.  The customer response to the changes screams that this version is an outright failure.  Wow how short-sighted of PF.,Awful update
2,2019-08-16 23:43:14,"Ok so unlike a lot of people leaving reviews, I never used the app to record workouts or track anything. The only thing I use my app for is the membership card scanning.

Now it still shows the “check-in” on the 3D Touch menu, HOWEVER when you select that it just goes to the main menu & you have to then click on the membership card in the corner. What’s the point??

You can no longer enter calories burned. Yes you can update your height and weight and that estimates calories burned but it doesn’t take into consideration the incline of the treadmill. I walk/jog with the maximum incline possible which is 15 at PF. I also change the speed throughout my workout. The new app doesn’t take any of this into consideration.

I received a reply from the developer acknowledging that the activity entry by photograph is no longer available, but that activity can still be entered. Apparently the developer has never tried to enter a work out because they would see that it sorely lacks the ability to enter variables of importance.

It doesn’t make much sense to log the amount of minutes I spent bench pressing, instead of the sets and reps.  Thank you!","App works well, a few recommendations"

Lastly, this isn’t a glitch but when you go to track an activity, there is a limited amount of activities to choose from.

But they only allow you to pay for the immediate fees with a credit card so they can start collecting ASAP. Then they only give you the option to continue paying by giving them your account and routing number.

What makes it worse is that I saw a blog review from years ago with pictures of this app and at the time it DID have functionality to list reps, lbs, etc for weights!

The app does not allow you to store what machine we use nor the settings and weights. Some of these machines have up to three different settings per person.

They did fix that but mph is not accurate so actual mileage is calculated wrong. You should be able to enter in what you did and save it.

For cycling, you have to select an “intensity” in the app, which it translates into some amount of calories, instead of just entering what the machine displayed.

I prefer going when no one else is there, so i don’t need to wait on the smith machines. Two used to mean that no one was there. Now, two can be anything from 3 on the old meter to 5.   Truly this is the worst anti user change i’ve ever seen. Why would anyone want LESS information????  If this doesn’t change i’m just going to switch to O2.

1,2018-05-31 03:20:42,The Planet Fitness app has an exceptionally bad user experience. You need a seperate log in for the PF store (even though it is part of the app) and then another for perkville. There is no field to enter the voucher codes issued by Planet Fitness.   It took over an hour to sign up only to place an order with it charging me full price instead of half off (as part my voucher).

1,2019-09-06 05:38:40,"Can’t take a picture of the screen for machine to upload is very frustrating. There is no treadmill option so therefore calories burned are incorrectly calculated.

3,2017-07-04 15:50:32,I have a bit of constructive criticism. Rather than bringing workouts from MyFitnessPal into the app... it should be the other way around so that workouts recorded at PF push to MFP for the daily calorie count.,Decent so far

1,2022-03-26 02:25:06,Lol I’ve heard such bad things about this company. They will charge you and not let you cancel for months and months and then try and ruin your credit. This is the biggest joke company I’ve ever seen. Just hands down pure evil stuff.,Criminals

1,2019-09-14 12:57:42,I don’t understand why you would remove the most valuable feature from the app? The snap feature was what made it a useful app for causal gym goers. It’s like you’re trying to think of ways to make people stop using the app and cancel their membership.,Why gut the app?
1,2019-09-05 22:56:27,With the redesign PF removed the ability to track club check-in history. This was my primary use for the app - without it I’ll be uninstalling. Very unfortunate to lose such basic functionality for useless (albeit nicely designed) features.,"Nice design, but a big step backward"
1,2019-08-17 14:35:26,I have no idea why this subpar update would replace the perfectly fine one I have been using for the last 3+ years... All my manually entered workouts are now gone. I wish I could give this thing less than zero stars.   So frustrating!,What the what!?

1,2020-03-13 04:34:56,The last two updates are just garbage. App looks as bad as its functions. Keeps getting worse with the updates. Who were the developers for this app one year ago? I’d be shocked if it’s these people. Much better then.,Updates keep getting worse.

1,2023-03-13 20:02:51,"Wow, these reviews. Same common theme. Instead of being able to cancel membership through the app. Which is a must. They make you jump through hoops to even attempt to cancel. I have seen this with companies before. It is a tactic to get more money from anyone and everyone. No auto withdrawal which is standard with upstanding companies. Why? Because of the fee they will quickly withdrawal (automatically) if you pay late. These are all strategies to take money away from people. They say the app is only for working with the gym..nope , its to have everything right there in one place to do it all. It’s the most organized way a good standing company does things. Many reviews of being over charged and not making it right and giving the money back..just wow..are they deliberately trying to drive people away from planet fitness?? Sure seems like it.. look at all the 1-star reviews. There are so many..some companies just do not understand business at all..sure with these tactics they will take extra money here and there but in the long run these tactic drive away more business and potential profits then it will ever gain!!..why cannot so many of these companies understand that! The responses are all copy paste generic replies. Bet this gets the same as well.   I recently went with a friend as a guest to planet fitness. It was nice, orderly, clean. It was definitely a nice place to work out. But after reading so many reviews the business end is just plain horrible. I decided on not getting a membership as i will not put myself through all the issues with my personal, hard worked for money. I never join with any company that does not have a easy, clear, fast way to cancel a membership if i need to! In the app itself only.

1,2022-09-07 17:53:42,"I attempted to join Planet Fitness (PF) today (9/6/22) and discovered that not only do you have to provide them with your credit card info, which is fine, but they also want your checking account info so they can deduct the monthly fee directly from your checking account. I don’t even allow my mortgage company direct access to my checking account. In this day and age of fraud and tech breaches, no way!  I read at least one review in here where someone said their account was overcharged by PF and the person couldn’t get their money back from them.    I called PF and they confirmed that bank info is required to join. The guy told me after the initial signup just come in and talk to the manager and ask him to remove the bank info from the account. First off, my bank info would still be in the system regardless, second, I see the conversation with the manager going like this, “I’m sorry, you were given bad information, bank info is required for membership and I can’t remove it.”  If you remove my bank info from the account how will PF get paid, credit card?  Why not start with the credit card to begin with?!?!  If you’re worried about the monthly credit card transaction fee just add the 3% ($0.30) to my monthly fee!  We’re talking about a $10 monthly fee, not thousands of dollars in a mortgage, give me a break. If someone doesn't pay their $10, deny their access to the facility. How hard can it be?  Paying with a credit card has protections for the consumer, giving you my checking account info eliminates those protections.

1,2022-03-02 02:50:17,Nah fam.,Why do I need an app to use the gym
1,2019-08-07 14:02:59,"This app revamp is going in totally the wrong direction for usability. The app looks more modern compared to the old version, but the simplicity of its user interface has been lost.  It also required that I not only sign back into the app after the update, but also required that I reset my password for the app. For which they send you an email to reset. Super inconvenient and would have been a pain in the glutes if I were already at the gym when I had to do it. The only minor silver lining was that I could set the new password to be the same as the old, so I didn’t have to remember a new password.   I can no longer browse the workout classes by type in order to see what days/times a specific type of class is available. Instead, now I have to select a specific day from the date selector and then scroll the schedule for that day to see if the class I’m looking for is available. Big step backward. The old app had a class filter and you could see all of the upcoming classes of that type for at least the next week.   It also shows me only one day at a time for classes now, where before if I kept scrolling it would transition from one day to the next. The old way allowed me to quickly check the next couple of days of class schedules without having to manually set the date selector for each individual day, one at a time.  As for the activity tracker for tracking your workouts, the new app has a much broader list of activities.  This is probably intended for tracking activities you do outside of the gym. Which is fine, but they got rid of the feature to take a photo of your workout machine to upload your workout automatically for the machines at the gym. I mostly do the treadmill when I go to the gym and I do a mix of walking and jogging during my session. I can’t remember how long of each that I do. So for the app to make me enter separate manual entries for both walking and running isn’t convenient. And there is no listing for treadmill, like there is for elliptical trainer, just general walking or running.  Going to the gym is enough of a work out as it is. I don’t want another workout just using this app. I hope they do a better blend of the old and new app features going forward.",Wrong direction

1,2019-10-03 16:40:22,"EDIT:  don’t update this app, if you have the old one it was better! I blindly updated while I took the summer off from the gym working out in the outdoors only to come back when the weather got cold and found the new version completely useless to me. The only thing of value I can possibly find at this point is to use the barcode to scan and so I don’t have to carry the card. Developers: if you’re listening make this available to the Wallet! I want to be able to scan in and I will use my own apps to track my workouts since you removed the photo capture option.     First off, I rarely rate apps. However, after taking the summer off from the gym and spending every day working out outside as soon as the weather got cold I went to go back to planet fitness and found my app had changed. The biggest problem that I found was the one thing that I used the app for besides signing in at the front desk, was to take a snapshot of my tread windmill work.  I did update my height and weight, but as another person said, without knowing the level it is woefully in accurate. I realize that even before it was not completely accurate, but now it is woefully in accurate.  At this point, this app serves me one single purpose only! That only purpose is to login at the front desk. I only use my other apps to track my steps which calculate my calories.    Extremely disappointed in the new app even though I realize a lot of work went into it, sometimes simpler is better. Perhaps there should be two versions one for a more intensely heavily used app, and one more like the old version that records snapshots from treadmills or ellipticals.",Loved The Older Version

1,2019-08-16 14:49:21,"I can no longer snap a picture of the cardio machine to track my workout automatically. New activity tracker in the app is useless - automatically calculates calories burned based on height/weight, but is always wrong. Not all workouts are the same: if I decide to go beast mode on the elliptical or decide to take it easy, the app will calculate the same amount of calories burned in that time no matter what. Lame.   Also: As a black card member I can still search for PF locations via the app, but can no longer favorite them (now relying on google maps to search/save locations) and I can no longer view the PE@PF schedule for all clubs, only my home club. Apparently to view the schedule and sign up for a class (WHICH I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THRU THE APP), I now have to go to the PF website & log in (haven’t verified that this method works because the website has issues displaying on my phone - if only there was a way to have this feature on the app OH WAIT YOU USED TO). This is true for many features that the app used to have but no longer does. Why? How is this useful/helping anybody???  ‘Workouts’ and ‘Exercises’ don’t really need separate tabs, they’re the same sort of content: video clips of fitness tips. It seems the update focuses mostly on these two features alone (which I will never use) and it really defeats the purpose of having a fitness trainer in the club available to ask for fitness tips. Seems like y’all want the app to do your job for you? Too busy standing at the front counter socializing while the newest team members are on cleaning duty.   I’m disappointed in planet fitness. I joined 2 weeks ago & was stoked about the usefulness of the app - felt like I was able to get my moneys worth out of my membership. With this update, I feel that the only feature I will use is the barcode (keytag) display to sign in at the club. Honestly.",Upgrade is a Downgrade
1,2023-08-19 08:15:58,"Planet Fitness was a great and affordable place to try and get my gym routine in order. I loved that it had many locations available to use and how inexpensive it was for all of the perks including bringing along a gym buddy.  HOWEVER.   I moved on. I’d moved into a different house/state, and I got a new job which offered a massive discount at another gym facility. It took me forever to figure out how the cancellation process went at PF. They make it EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to cancel. I had moved quite a few times during my membership but my home club was where I had originally started the membership. To cancel, you either have to mail them a note, or you have to go there in person. It took me MONTHS to be able to make time to go to my home club in person to cancel. At this point I had already started my other membership, so I was literally paying TRIPLE what I was paying prior to because I couldn’t get this membership canceled.  I FINALLY WENT IN TO CANCEL THE MEMBERSHIP. It was actually really relieving how quick and easy the process was once I finally got in there to cancel. I had to sign a couple of forms and that was it. The visit took about 5 minutes. On their cancellation request form, it charges you for the following month after you cancel. I thought that was kind of stupid but I bit the bullet…as I already had been doing for several months.  THIS ALL HAPPENED 3 MONTHS AGO.   My cancellation request had been uploaded and on file for my membership but my membership remains active. At this point, Planet Fitness has pulled 2 extra months of charges out of my bank account, and A NEW ANNUAL FEE.  I was absolutely FURIOUS, as they have literally STOLEN almost $100 from me at this point. I calmly called my home facility to inquire about this issue AND THE STAFF PUT THE PHONE IN THEIR POCKET, WENT TO THE BATHROOM, AND HUNG UP. I now have to make time to go back out there in person to handle this issue BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER FORM OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT.   PLANET FITNESS IS A SCAM!!  I had also been talking to other friends and relatives who have gone thru similar issues, one had to pay a fee at their bank to stop the payments, and then PLANET FITNESS TURNED THEM INTO COLLECTIONS WHEN THEY STOPPED PAYING THE CHARGES AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY CANCELED THEIR MEMBERSHIP BUT WERE STILL BEING BILLED.",PLANET FITNESS STEALS MONEY!!!

2,2023-09-18 23:33:28,"They have you hook up your bank account to the app and it will charge that account as scheduled of course as you would expect. They wait till the weirdest times to take the money you owe obviously hoping you don’t have the available funds. They have absolutely no way to pay and or cancel ahead of time or right then and there when you want either over the phone or in person. They instead due to “policy” need you to come in and handle anything to do with account payment and or cancellation. I get a company’s gotta make it’s money somehow. But this is literally a legal scam loop hole. You guys should really think about setting up a system in the app that allows the use of credit and or debit cards to make purchases such as paying bills rather then making it complicated for the user to pay a bill and have to hope they have the available fund when you go to withdrawal the payment. Yes I do understand to a extent the person should be responsible but for people like me with mental disability’s it’s not easy to remember things especially with my severe ADHD it’s hard for me to remember I have a payment coming up and to make sure the moneys there rather if there was an option to pay by card rather then bank account and a way to cancel online or in app rather then having to go in person especially when some may not live near the club they have to go to so they can cancel. Side not with the ability to pay for things in app via debit card then bank accounts you could then add purchase options for those using basic to pay for a code that allows them one time access to black card features / amenities like massage chair access, hydro massage bed access, tanning bed, etc. I also realize that adding a card portion also costs processing fees and what not causing prices to have raise a bit but that’s a little price to pay for more convenience and a better user experience making it more enjoyable and less aggravating to deal with and navigate being someone with a disability or an average joe. (Not like I actually expect anyone to read this whole review but if you did and made it to the end and you’re  reading this thanks and if your a developer of the app maybe take some of these suggestions and concerns to your bosses this has been an ongoing deal and change is needed I will continually copy and paste this into an email and send it in every day until something is done!)

It seems that this recent change (last three or four years I think) is intentional, getting some kind of revenue through their app. I may be wrong about that; but I just can’t see another useful purpose. But I digress from the reason I came here to review. Since I’m forced to use this app for checking in upon arrival, it would seem that I could add my virtual key tag to my Apple Wallet to make it quicker to check in, preventing my need to open an app each time I’m coming to the gym. (Unless it really is about some revenue mechanism gained from my needing to open the app) Also, what I could find as a useful feature and well worth launching this “app for nothing” would be the “crowd meter.” Unfortunately, this data is based on recent historical data. It would be much more useful if it was based on the current crowd, who all have had to check in with their QR codes in their useless PF apps as well. I know the data from check ins is populating a database immediately, even if it’s local and is normally synced as a close out procedure at the end of business days. If that’s the case, a simple matter of satellite servers used to sync data in real time would solve this issue. Without the Wallet option for check ins and a real time crowd meter to prevent me from driving to the gym when I see two bars and arriving to find standing room only, this app is just an imposed data collection device I have to have on my phone to use the membership I pay for. After I leave this review, I intend to take a screenshot of my check in QR code and delete this useless app. Include my suggested feature updates or expect me to start a social media campaign with this review featured as an appeal for all PF members to do as I’m about to do. 🫡",Useless as a screen door on a submarine…

I should be able to put my own workout plan into my app instead of having to use the notes on my phone. Really the only thing this tracks is the treadmill and it still doesn’t let you put in your own time.

Here’s my suggestions for improvement:  Home page - make 6 main buttons - a long button on the top labeled “MEMBERSHIP CARD,” that takes you to the membership page because I had zero clue the “check in” had the QR code on it; a four square scrolling menu buttons below that- Perks, Recommended, Virtual Tour, Suggested Workouts; and another long bar button at the bottom with a contact/locator.  Workout page - allow users to build their next work out by dragging and dropping workouts into a queue and adjust for things like time, intensity, area of focus, etc. similar to the first suggestion, make these buttons that users can click or tap and it opens that information.   My journey - have a “You spent X hours working on your goal!” banner. And fit everything on to one page. There’s no reason to scroll down. Everything should be right there.

I love that there is no judgment however I now feel very uncomfortable going to the gym with my husband. There are young girls walking around in their sports bras. Most of the bras look just like a bra. One girl even showed her nipples through the bra. Whatever happened to the dress code. No spaghetti straps? This is worse than spaghetti straps.  Everyone else wears t shirts! Men and other modest women.This is intimidating . It’s winter!  Are they just looking for attention from men? Go to a bar for that not the gym. Why are these women allowed to dress like this. And then there’s the circuit where people just come in and go on just certain machines while some people actually do the circuit. And then even some people hog the machines by sitting on their phones. It’s not fun to go to the gym anymore. No one walks around and checks on the rule breakers either.,Gym Goer

The result is my phone regularly goes extremely dark and I have to keep manually setting it back.   Other than that my only complaint is that the things I’m in there to do—check how busy it is, check in, track activities, review activities— always seem a little harder to find than the “Black Card” content, videos, and 3rd party offers.

After more reading from searches, I looked how I scan in & it’s a QR Code with no info.  The 3 most intuitive places to find this information don’t have it. FAQ tells me I can change clubs, & it has a helpful purple link for me to directly do that from the FAQ. It also says I need the Keytag info.

The “crowd meter” is a fake meter. It doesn’t tell you how many members are ACTUALLY there currently working out. The app is loaded with useless coupons for brands I’ll never pay for because these brands overcharge for the goods anyway. Brands should just be charging less for their goods 24/7/365 if they actually wanted my business. I’m so sick of “coupons”. You don’t encourage my loyalty in a brand by being expensive all the time and then once in a blue moon you do a tiny sale! The workouts on the app are horrible. As an ex personal trainer, I cringe at how useless these workouts are. You’re literally better off avoiding these stupid things. Why? Because these videos teach you what I call “learned helplessness”. You are learning, but you are learning how to do inefficient and ineffective workouts. This makes you dumber than if you went on your own fitness journey and bought lots of books on the subject to learn about weight training and cardio. They have activity tracking on there (which is also dumb). You SHOULD KNOW how often you’re going to the gym. If you forgot when the last time was, then it’s already been too long. Fitness is an obsession. It doesn’t work if you only do it “once in a while”. You have to always be thinking about it every dang day. It’s a lifestyle. They don’t teach you that with an app. They could if they had actually useful videos on their app with guests talking about such things.",Garbage

In the previous version of the app I was able to check myself in and click one button underneath the QR code to get my guest list. That’s now been replaced with a referral link, which I do not understand why since as a BCM I’m probably gonna be bringing people as guests more often then having them sign up for themselves, especially as I’m checking in. It’s honestly more convenient for me to screenshot my QR code and my guests’ QR codes since I don’t have to wait for the app to load and they are in the same place and I just have to swipe to get from one to the other. The “perks” are not really worth going out of my way to use the app for them, and the crowd meter does not seem to accurately reflect how generally busy it currently is.

I love that Planet Fitness is a judgment free zone and that beginners, like me, feel welcome and supported in our fitness journeys.  I have experienced tremendous support as a cancer survivor from my local PF gym! And,  I love the PF app and all of the exercise videos.  However, I took a star away for two reasons.  First, I wish I could simply use my Apple Watch to check in and that the app had Apple Watch functionality in general.  Secondly, a lot of people who join Planet Fitness are new to exercising or out of shape - that’s why the “judgment free zone” is so appealing.  Well, it would be very helpful for beginners like me to be able to log the weight settings that I’m using on the machines in the app.  Lets say I’m using a tricep extension machine at a weight setting of 50.  I wish I could open the app and scan a code on the machine.  Then, have a picture of the tricep extension machine appear with something like a “my settings” info box underneath the machine picture.  Like have a little scroll bar underneath that would show my current weight setting (50) and then allow me to scroll and increase the weight setting to like 55 or 60 when I’m ready.  But, that way I could track my progress for that machine and it would be easier to remember what weight I’m using for each machine.

As far as I know this gym is a popular gym, so I chose to become a member of this gym.  I went to this gym on the third day, and only half hour later they cut my lock in the locker room.  Without my consent, cut my lock.  Also touch my personal belongings.  They said I leave my stuff for overnight, but when it happened it was 3 pm.  I only went in for half hour and cut my lock，I was shocked.If it is overnight, they should cut the lock at night.  But It's 3pm noon.  .  .  Anyway, my experience with this gym is disgusting.  This is a gym where can cut your locks casually. You can go if you like, but I won’t go again.

To add on to that, it’s now “policy” to only use your digital tag or else they won’t let you in, what kind of policy is that when the ONLY purpose of the app is to keep me sign and check in and they can’t get that right. Employees will just look at you like “idk what to tell you”. Customer service will just tell you to go check with your gym.  Please fix this! One thing just one thing, NOBODY and I mean NOBODY uses your app for anything else, for the one thing it was meant for. I have apps I haven’t used in years and somehow I’m still sign in.

With the new app out for this long and it being one of the main complaints I’m unsure as to why the developers have not brought this feature back. All their feedback says is they are looking into the possibility of bringing it back. O.o seems to me if the majority want it back that’s not something to look into it’s something to do!! I agree with most comments the call was does tremendously on this upgrade (it wasn’t broke so why change it!?) the build for the activity section is piss poor. There is no point of tracking a workout with inaccurate results. How many comments feedback or 1 Star ratings will it take before you put a plan to rectify this in action smdh.,No Xcapture

I don’t like that this app does not let you add more detail activities when it comes to lifting weights and the type of machines or weights you are using. Simply having a category in activities is useless because all lifting is not created equal. You should also be able to scan all machines that you worked on (treadmills, stairs, weights, etc) and the app should either retrieve the information form the machines like the treadmill or you’ll should be able to enter the weight used and reps for lifting. Including activities that you can do outside of the gym is nice, but this  really lacks when it comes down to what you did in the gym.

Apparently that important fraternity was recently REMOVED! The app offers videos. The app brings up your membership barcode to scan in to the center when you arrive, and to make black card spa appointments.   It’s stunning that the developers would remove such a feature, which for me is the main reason to have the app in the first place. I agree with the recent criticisms that this should be restored.

The issue I keep having is that, when I search for a town that doesn’t have its own club location, it just says there’s nothing available instead of, I don’t know, reccomending something nearby? I mean, would it be difficult to program the locator to be able to find the next nearest thing when I type in a zip code or town that doesn’t have its own club? That would make it easier to plan trips so I don’t have to wait til I reach my destination to find out where the nearest location is. Everything else about the app is decent",Pretty Good

1,2019-05-13 02:40:06,"I did workout at planet fitness for more than an year. It was all good until I had to move from NJ South Plainfield to NC. My home PF did some mistake to transfer me to new location and cancelled the membership, while asking me to take new membership. I wasn’t aware of the cancellation fee for having a black card. I ended up paying $58 for cancellation and just a week before that they charged the annual maintenance also, so basically ended up paying~ $110 as a moving cost to them due to their mistake. When I argued to correct their mistake to revert cancellation, instead of trying to correct, I was threatened to call the security. F**k B**t**ds. Manager/Team Lead, Mr Sabastien to be blamed for being so unprofessional. Big No to PF ever! I got better gym in NC and workout results are also turning out very well.",Beware of the contracts fees when you move out!

The hydro massage beds and massage chairs after/before a work out is so necessary for me as I get older.  Trust me, spend the extra 10.00 a month to get the black card.  It’s so worth it!  Now to the fantastic bright and beautiful app.  So many great features and very user friendly. Thank you PF for listening to the customers.    The only criticism, it takes awhile for your snap shot work outs to appear in the app.  So manually is the way to go for me for now, but I had to dig deep for that one.

3,2018-11-18 15:47:48,The app seems to work fine. I’ve explored some of the features of this app but I primarily only use it to pull up my pass bar code to scan into the gym. This is my main gripe. It takes what feels like an eternity for the app to start and then to open the barcode. Why can’t you allow for an Apple Wallet membership card? I can’t imagine it would be too hard to do as everyone from Starbucks to hotels to grocery stores use this feature. It would be nice to simply bring up my pass on my phone quickly or on my watch without even having to take my phone out of my bag.,Ok but have patience

It was suggested by the staff at my gym, that I log out or redone load the app and enter my new barcode, but it recognizes my email and won’t let me create a new account.

I haven’t been able to login to MyFitnessPal for the two years I have had the app. Apple Wallet (Formally Passbook)has been around for over 6 years as I write this. Seriously, How hard would it be to implement? Machines like the Arc-Trainer aren’t even available to enter my workout info into. My local club uses Life-Fitness brand Equipment and the all have a QR code on them that I should be able to scan and have the machine pop up so I can enter my workout data but that’s not even a option.

I went to log in the app again and I couldn’t. So I reset my password and logged in and it showed my wife’s info, and when she downloaded the app and installed and scanned it showed my info. Somehow PF, or the app swapped our barcodes. Have no idea how that happened. Oh well, I guess I’ll just re-enter the new barcodes so they will be correct on our phones, but wait - you can’t! And so I figured I would try to create a new account in order to be prompted to add the code again, but it says I already have an account and so I can’t. Then I tried logging in again after changing my password successfully but it failed and the temp password still works for some reason. What a piece of crap!!
