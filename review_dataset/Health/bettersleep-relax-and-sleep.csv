So rated 5 stars now for developer help and good answer!  Decided to check this app out again after several years (I bought the lifetime subscription back before there was a lot of other subscription options) and remember being able to use this app with music I had in my iPhone, with the app itself. (So if you had relaxing music, you could have that playing while also having the sounds the app had as well) However I noticed, now it doesn’t use that as an option anymore :( Just wanted to write this review, in case the developer will check this review out with an answer to if there is a reason for this or not (I’d understand if Apple came back at them saying they aren’t allowed to use music from people’s music library, but otherwise I feel like it would be something they should add back in, if possible) It’s cool that they supply other music options, but would really like to use some music that I’d provide, just for myself personally. (I’d rate it higher, as definitely feels worth it, but taking that away as an option just feels like a downgrade too, unless again Apple forced that hand)",Got this app years ago (and  remember using it a lot)
5,2021-09-02 15:57:14,"This app caused me wonderful yet strange dreams. I’ve never, ever had them until my brain got creative and took me to journies never seen before! I’ve been having these dreams since when I downloaded this app! It’s so peaceful & helps me sleep better. 2013, so it’s 2020, 7+ years of AWESOME! I love Sweet Hour Prayer, Cat Purring, Music Box, and much more! They are so calming and pleasing to hear. You might like other ones, and that’s cool, too! HIGHLY recommend this beauty sleeper. I sleep better and have been doing so for 7+ years after downloading. I deactivated my old account & deleted the app because I wanted to live without it since I slept better, but times I needed the app again. I redownloaded as a result & suddenly I have the free sounds. I saw the sweet hour prayer locked and felt bad even the other ones I’ve had immense dreams with. After hearing the ones I heard now (because I heard them too), it took me back to the dreams I had when I fell asleep with the sounds. I know, sounds weird, but I have memories even with sound and then I remember the DREAMS I had so good. I remember from the middle (a little of the beginning) and mostly the ending of my dreams, so I can picture them thanks to the sounds. TLDR; Some dreams were a little eerie or perhaps crazy, but that are dreams. And I love sleeping so thank you very very much! I enjoy this app! 5 STARS ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ P.S. I’m sorry for making a very long explaination.",Love At First Site
5,2023-03-17 17:31:33,"I’ve tried a lot of things for sleep sounds. But, year after year after year (how long have I been using this? A decade at least!), I consistently use this app. It’s always improving, even though I’ve never personally found it lacking. It’s amazing to have so much ability to customise mixes. I like layering multiple water sounds, brown noise, and a little quiet thunder. It’s created an almost Pavlovian response; I start playing my mix, and next thing I know, I’m asleep.   I’ve struggled with sleep my entire life, partially due to just luck with biology, and also severe PTSD. I used to wake dozens of times in a night. Every small sound or shift in the room or house, and I’d be awake, full of anxiety. And certain sounds/frequencies bother me and/or trigger migraines, and that made it hard to play sounds that would both sufficiently drown out the tiny noises and also not leave me in pain. I’m a difficult customer. 🤷‍♀️  But this app is, and I cannot emphasise it enough, the absolute crown champ in its genre. Now in fairness, I’ve done a lot of work to reduce my sleep issues and PTSD symptoms, but it’s really nice to have an app that I can make work for me, for any kind of day, regardless of symptoms. It’s not a cure, obviously, but it never pretends to be. It’s just a sleep sound app that goes all in on what it aims to do… and it succeeds.",Hands down best sleep/soundscape app

I still felt her blood on me, heard her panicked voice.....I never thought I'd sleep again. Then.....I discovered better sleep. It did what other apps don't. It turned my phone into my friend. Helped me relax through all kinds of meditations, bedtime stories and more. I began to find joy in turning on my phone, putting on a story and listening to the narrator as I fall asleep. It didn't take long for me to get hooked on this app. In a good way. Better sleep is like a friend. A life long dear friend.....no....it's more like.....it's a compassionate experience like what you get when you're a child held by your mother. The voice overs are so gentle and inviting while the background music is so magical and mood inspiring. The stories are something you can't help but embrace. The meditations are guided by the narrator as if it's a teacher in your room. Better sleep is my hero. Wonder if this could have saved mom if I had known abiut better sleep back then. Thank you better sleep for giving me a future to look forward to. I was starting to think I would live the rest of my life fearful of sleep. Now I live my life normal again with a healthy view of sleeping, wrapped in the arms of my friend, better sleep.",This app saved my life
5,2017-09-28 05:24:48,"This app has been the greatest gift to help me SLEEP!  I can create happy sounds of the nighttime environment experienced when I was a child, taking me far away from the pressures and responsibilities of the days responsibilities to joyful happiness and peace. My breathing slows down, my body succumbs to a relaxed state and often a slight restful happy smile comes to my lips as my mind travels through space and time, enjoying imaginations created by gentle sounds, time and space.  3 years ago someone ran a red light and changed my physical world forever. I will never know the absence of sound or still quiet again because of the constant buzzing sound of tinnitus created  in my head by the crash impact to my head. My form of tinnitus is the ability to hear the normal sounds of the brain functioning, which normally we can't hear.  Relaxed Melodies has given so much to strengthen my life, rest better and feel positive. My brain may never experience quiet again, but the creators of Relaxed Melodies has given me something far better and more valuable to my life than experiencing 'quiet'. They've given me the ability to experience beautiful dreams and imaginations in waking and sleep states of mind. I will be forever grateful to their work and share it with as many people as possible.",Happy and Peaceful Escapes to Beautiful Worlds
5,2019-08-29 05:27:18,"I recently saw an app called “Calm.” It described something similar to how this app runs but you couldn’t customize your choices. The only difference is there is bed time stories. Also... Everything is locked. You have to pay $80 to actually get most things in that app. Plus it’s a membership... I could get most of that and more in RelaxMelody’s and still get the membership. In my opinion $5 a month is reasonable. $50 a year is so much better than the other. We have choices to keep our subscriptions and to buy the monthly membership or yearly. Either way we still have an easier time paying. With “Calm”, the membership is only the option for a year. That’s asinine... I was introduced RelaxMelody’s by my old therapist and I’ve never stopped loving it. I have zero complaints what so ever. Though I do have a suggestion... In an app I’ve used in the past, I got the option to watch a video and get that button/function for free (for a span of 24 hours)... You’d still get ad revenue but you’d also get people to be more interested in not wasting time on ads & just buy the membership. -Just an idea I liked. Thank you for making this app, I’ve honestly benefited from this way more than anyone could imagine. I love all the new updates, too...",Compare 5/5 Suggestion 4.5/5
5,2022-08-31 10:39:36,"As far as I can remember this app represents great features, I remember in old days it had eye comfort wood sound and etc etc, but now it's changed and still is one of the most adorable ones, I do care about how a service can provide me best options because I have tried my best in other to be the best in my field, so I want the best, but unfortunately, I live in Iran and haven't access to pay the app for sounds, and it's really helpful, or it was, I do understand how complicated things are in developed countries but in Iran 😂😂😂😂 I can't find a good word to describe 😂 so please in some points think about some middle eastern countries like us that we don't have access to payments and even if we had we couldn't due to our economic problems but overall thanks for your hard work I have always been thankful for your app and hard work, great management sight well done 🤝❤️  What a great response dear Nat what a classy move well-done guys world-class phenomenon.

5,2021-06-15 08:01:38,"I downloaded all the Ipnos apps ages ago, and they were some of my favorites. But, they became out of date. I recently rediscovered the fully reworked Relax Melodies, and it seems they’ve wisely decided to concentrate their attention on a single app with a subscription service. But, my old purchase with access to sounds was retained (before subscribing), giving me confidence that they are a good company.  The strength of the app is the design / visuals. It is quite beautiful and relaxing to look at before you even use it. But, as a person who has long suffered with insomnia, it’s clear that the developers are actually dedicated to the function of the app. I love the random feature - choosing sounds added a bit of anxiety for me (as a perfectionist, I wanted to try them all and create unique combos). Luckily, I can pay ppl to do that for me, and it makes my life a little easier.   But, the new expanded app is not just a noise machine. It has breathing exercises, meditations, and stories which make up most of the content. What started as a simple concept is now a one stop sleep app. I’ve also tried Insight Timer and Calm, plus various music apps, but this one seems like it might be my favorite for bedtime. Thanks!","New subscriber , super excited!"
5,2018-01-26 00:42:18,"Update: After using it a few days, I like this app so much that I decided to pay for the lifetime subscription! There's lots of customization available: there are many sound options (both ambient and musical), you can control the volume of each added element and you can even add binaural beats or isochronic tones to enhance your experience (e.g. deep meditation, relaxation, concentration). I've been looking for a good sound machine app and this app is a perfect fit. I use it mainly to concentrate & focus at work. But I used one of the meditations before bed the other night & fell right to sleep. So it's great for concentration AND relaxation.   The only thing I'm missing is the ability to add some of my own recorded sound bites. I thought I could because it allows you to use your own music, but I have some clips of my dog barking, my phone ringing, background office chatter, etc, that I wanted to mix in with the included sounds and I don't see any way to do that.  Other than that, it meets all my expectations plus there are some nice guided meditations. :)  Previous review: I've played around with it a little and it seems great. You can mix custom ambient sounds and listen to them along with guided meditations. I'm looking forward to using it on a regular basis.",Great Sound Machine App!
5,2018-08-14 05:25:19,"immediate restless relief, it makes me go to sleep as soon as i press play. the sounds are great, and personalized- YOU pick the sounds YOU want! the downfall is some sounds you have to pay for which absolutely disappointing. i would have given it a 5 star review if there was no premium package that costs anything plus. the meditations are great- again, they are also personalized. the timers work wonderful- if you don’t want to drain your battery you set a timer for, per say, maybe 30 minutes and after you are sound asleep it will shut off and not drain your phone battery. this app also lets you set alarms that i can always get up too, i never have once heard it go off at any other time or not go off at all. if you don’t have an alarm clock or any clock where you need one, there’s an option where it says alarm clock and you can chose a style, and there’s a clock that stays open on your phone while you sleep. so if you have to get up to use the restroom or grab a drink, you can easily see the phones alarm clock on your nightstand. Love the app, just wish it was all free. This is the best sound/relaxing app on the markets right now! Would definitely recommend!",amazing!
3,2022-05-24 03:00:30,"I’m very frustrated because of a couple things… I did a free trial and liked the app, so I got an annual membership. The MOMENT the trial was done, which was of course in the middle of the night and woke me up, the app didn’t utilize my membership even after restoring it over and over, and repeatedly locked me out and deleted all my mixes and favorites. I ended up reinstalling and that seemed to fix it, although I had to start from scratch on everything… but now the best and only feature that compelled me to purchase premium no longer works. This app won’t play in the background anymore. And I can find any instructions, documentation, anything to help me find the widget button thing I read in the reviews. My settings screen doesn’t have anything like that, and I’ve tried looking in every screen so far and still cannot find it. Why can’t this app have a user guide? One that shows screens and buttons, like normal apps, and explains the settings and how to find things, etc. this is really frustrating since I still can’t get it to work and haven’t heard back from anyone. If you change features, tell your users and provide documentation. It’s that simple.  Edit: changed to 3 stars after customer service addressed the issue. Still not impressed by the help site and lack of user guide.",Very very frustrated
3,2021-03-24 05:02:21,I really like this app. I use it a lot since I need noise to fall asleep. I've thought about going pro multiple times but I haven't because you cannot preview the sounds and I think that is not only ridiculous but bad marketing! I would give 5 stars if you could but you cannot so 3 it is. March 2021 update: Not sure when I left my first update but I’ve been using this app for two years now and I know that because I’m super creative at titles here’s looking at you June 2019. Anyways I’ve always really been cautious about noise machines because.... OK I’m clearly paranoid. Like who’s putting what secret things in them or subliminal messages or you know what I don’t listen to the water ones because I don’t wanna have to get up to pee at night. Anyways March 2021 it has been discovered that my paranoia is justified because I have now discovered an extra sound in one of the options. In the monk chant there is the sound of what I believe is a keytar. I don't know if this is a glitch or what but again paranoid. This is actually the first time I used I guess somebody else’s mix and I have used the monk chant before and never noticed it maybe it’s because of the different volumes I put it at but as I write this it's the only sound playing and it's clear as day. Now instead of sleeping I'm scrolling through reviews to see if anyone else noticed it 😖😖😖,One problem
2,2022-04-13 04:09:52,"Sooooo. I used to really like this app but I need talking to fall asleep so this app doesn’t work read this review to find out about that. This review talks about goods and( mostly) bads so first is good there is a lot of sounds and you can make your own! Bad so there is like 2 stories that are free and like 4 meditations that are free so if your looking for free meditations then this is not the app for you. Also if you want all of the stuff unlocked then you will need to buy premium for like $60 a year. My parents will not let me buy anything on any app so this is me and my moms suggestion: what if, you did like you could unlock one storie/meditation/sound by itself for like $8-$10 dollars a year to unlock one at least take this in mind And also you guys always are like,” oh we understand your concern and we will try to fix it 😊💤💤” NO. You always do this! I have requested this for MONTHS and updated it every time! I’m so fed up with them sending me notifications that,” oh, a new story came out listen to it now😊💤” I just turned them off! Every now and then I check in and see if they UNLOCKED any thing but NO! I’m not using this app anymore! I’ll keep it just so that if they do take care of my request I can rate it but I’m not using this anymore I’ve found a new app. Thanks for reading this. Just take in mind that if you don’t want to pay... find a new app.",Pls look!
2,2020-05-09 18:53:18,"Upon downloading this app I was rather excited more so after reading a couple reviews on how this app really helped soothe, calm the mind and maintain the body at a peaceful state. But Im disappointed that the app doesn't even allow the user to listen to some of the program boxes within the Meditations section for a trial run. How am I going to pay for something I cant even have a glimpse of? On some Im really interested in listening to like the Kids, Deep Sleep, Insomnia and Napping, for example, they're all locked. One should be available for each of the sections, at least. I don’t understand this concept.  Something else I have noticed is that it doesn’t save my favorites ever. I have made sound mixes and it doesn't save them . The app doesn’t even let me trial run that to see how it works!  Also, if it was a one time payment for the app in order to have full access for life that would be better. Whatever the price they decided was decent for their company to sell it for on the App Store would be more reasonable than what theyre asking you to commit to paying to have full access forever.  I was hoping for a better experience with this app but nothing convinces me to get it. And it’s seriously such a great idea for those who have trouble sleeping and relaxing or who  need a pick me up, seems to me like it would work but how am I even supposed to confirm this? Gonna consider just deleting soon.",Not convinced
2,2021-12-21 13:55:33,"There is a lot to love about this app it’s crammed with so much, but still easy to navigate and it’s beautiful from start to finish.  The reason I love this app is its beautiful sounds you can mix for a pleasing background noise while you sleep. That said I can’t justify another yearly subscription in my life especially because it’s not a cheap one either… there’s tons of free alternatives that aren’t as nice but get the job done. My ideal view on this app is a version that I can pay once for even if it’s somewhat costly or significantly less on the subscription say $20 a year? Strip out majority of the stuff that I don’t need or use if that’s what it takes. I want this app for its ability to mix and match beautiful varied sounds along with its beautifully easy to navigate design. I could totally do without the weekly in app content updates, the articles, meditations, stories, sleepmoves, breathe functionality etc. Basically, my ideal use for this app is how it was when it first released all those years ago but in its current modernized state. A beautiful easy to navigate app that has loads of sounds that are beautiful/varied and mixable. Remove anything else that causes the subscription to exist or be so high and I’d pay for that app or that cheaper subscription and give 5 stars in a heartbeat! Please consider it devs :)",Yearly Subscription $$$

I rebooted my iPad, updated the app, and can’t find a way to keep the app going. It’s Sunday, so there is no one available to help me. The automated bot said to go to settings, find the app, and “clear cache” … but that option isn’t there. The other ways I’ve found to clear the app cache require the app to be open, which of course doesn’t happen. The kicker of this? My subscription just renewed, a couple weeks ago, for a year. UGH. Developer, please respond! Thank you!  Update: I ended up having to delete the app and reinstall it. Thankfully all my sounds were still there when I opened it again. Dev seems to have missed the part where I said I updated the app. That was one of the first things I did. As much as I love my sleep sounds, I’m not sure I’ll be keeping my subscription when it expires next year.

5,2022-02-23 05:36:09,"This app is truly my favorite app-store purchase ever. I use it almost daily, and have for around 3 years now. I never really write app reviews but this one is truly worthy of it. One of my favorite aspects of this particular app is that it’s always growing, always evolving and always seems better than before. There are so many different things to explore in it; from making your own mixes of soothing sounds (there’s a ton of elements to choose from and they’re always being added to) meditations, bedtime stories, analysis of your sleep style, and even movements to do before bed. The interface is very polished and beautiful, organized, and allows you to save your favorite sounds, mixes, meditations, etc. Or if you’re not into that, you can choose from pre-made ones as well. Pretty much everything it offers will guarantee you a great night of rest no matter what soothes you.

5,2018-07-05 08:18:30,"The best app that I could find. Number 1 option for me is that it stays working when it doesn’t have focus.  I use it on my family vacations. So even if I do wake up early in the hotel room, I can check the weather or read the news and the sound keeps playing. That way the family can still sleep. Believe it or not, many other sleep apps can’t do that.  Awesome feature... You can mix and match different sounds AND individual volumes for each sound.  Ever get a sleep app with a pattern? Where the white noise or fan app is starting to chant at you? Like “there’s an open jar of kosher dill pickles in the fridge.... There’s an open jar of kosher dill pickles in the fridge.... There’s an open jar of kosher dill pickles in the fridge....” Being able to mix and match eliminates all that. You can mix rain with rain on roof, rainy day, heavy rain, and even throw in some ocean waves. Who doesn’t like to take a nap on a rainy day near the ocean?  You can save your mixes. There’s a shut off timer and wake up alarm. I’ve never tried the alarm feature.  I just use the IOS alarm on my phone, which completely overrides the sleep app. I sleep to my rainy day mix and wake to Walking on Sunshine.",Super customizable

I’m an early user of this app, back when it was called Relax Melodies, and I just have to say, please please please stop with the “LAST CHANCE 30% off” pop up. It has been the “last chance” for months now. Give an option to opt out or something, please.  It’s not enough to make me abandon the app, because I love the mix I’ve made for sleep, but it’s frustrating to get a pop up I have to close every other time I open it. I understand that ad support is needed for free accounts, and that this annoyance may be intentional to encourage subscriptions to get rid of it, but please stop with the (false) advertisement that there is some discount that will be disappearing, because it hasn’t, and I don’t think I’m the only one frustrated by this. I’d be more willing to spend money on the app if it weren’t so persistent. Otherwise, I’ve been using this app 5+ years and can’t really sleep well without it so I’ve been bottling my frustration until now, so if you don’t mind frequent annoying pop ups to subscribe then I highly recommend it.",Long time user; annoyed

I’ve always had trouble sleeping and dreaded lying awake at night. Now I look forward to a peaceful transition. Thanks Relax Melodies!!  I’ve now had the app for a couple of months. In addicted!! I’ve had trouble sleeping all of my life. As soon as I start to get tired, instead of lying for hours in the dark, I put on a story—a new one or one of my very favorites—and sometimes before I’ve even listened for five minutes, I’m already out!  I cannot believe it.  Also, great meditation guides. I am not one to sit still long enough for any type of “meditation”. But at times when I am so stressed, and I can’t relax, I’ve gone to my room, turned out the lights and listened to a meditation. It has put me in a completely relaxed state and brought down my blood pressure and heart rate. Wow!

So when I graduated college and got into my first big girl corporate job that starts every weekday at 7am sharp, I quickly realized I was in serious trouble. I had to be up by 5am to be on the freeway by 6:15am to be at work by 7am, but I could NEVER fall asleep before 12am. I usually have Netflix on in the background while I try to fall asleep, but Criminal Minds infiltrating my dreams wasn't helping me and I was not sleeping well until a friend recommended that I meditate before sleeping. Naturally, I googled meditation/sleeping apps because there is an app for everything and I stumbled upon this app. I absolutely LOVE it. Granted, you have to pay for the nicer things, like life coach and dreaming meditations, but what is available for free is more than enough for me. My favorite sound mix is called ""Afternoon on the Porch."" It has wind chimes and soft rain and gentle thunder in the background. It's a perfect mix to help me fall asleep. What's also nice is the timer, which exits the app after 30 minutes (or however many minutes you choose). I usually play the sound effects on my iPad and stand it on my bedside table.

I’m only about ten years old and a lot of things like meditations and stories are locked because my parents will not let me spend money on stuff like this and I feel like this might be an issue for other people that are younger like in the age range of six through eleven. I have heard all the unlocked stories like spaceship 28, and The underwater city. I also heard all the meditations like, Dropping into the present moment. I would really like to hear something new for a change. Like if a teacher was to read a book and then read it again and again every day for the ten months your in school it probably wouldn’t be fun. Just like how listening to the same things over and over again can get boring and even annoying. It’s a very good app I’ve been using it for two or more years now and it’s prevented so much stress. But I just need a new story that  I can listen to. All I’m saying is that the people who don’t have the things unlocked should have a bit more songs",All things are locked

When I downloaded this app I found the developer changed to a subscription based service. I HAVE NEVER appreciated renting software and I stated that in my first review.  I’ve dumped most of my Adobe products for started  this ridiculous  policy. Anyway, the developer read my review and reached out to me to restore my first purchase. WOW, we still have ethical people in this world. Way to go guys!  As far as the app goes it’s one of the best I’ve used for sleep. Nothing else has done anything to help me sleep and I’ve tried everything from medical marijuana, CBD, and ambien pills. This app and a nice pair of headphones has helped immensely.  I particularly like the way Tracks can be layered.  If you desire you can created different track for every night for the rest of your life and never have a repeat.  That could be a suggestion for a future release. Have the program randomly chose tracks and mix them. Thanks Again for restoring my previous purchase. Your the BEST.",For Real?

1,2022-08-14 10:23:27,"I don’t like any app that only gives you the option to request to delete or erase your information/profile. This should be automatic when a user opts to delete, it shouldn’t be a request. Had I known this was the case I wouldn’t have used the app in the first place. Beyond that if you’re attempting to use the dream journal there’s no way to erase specific nights entirely if something went wrong. So if the data is messed up there’s no way to undo the night, making the information it compiles useless. It also prompts you to upgrade far too much, I barely get a chance to test out the app before being bombarded by prompts to upgrade. Update: to be clear my problem is not the speed in which the information collected from this app is deleted, it’s the fact that it’s up to someone else to delete user information rather than having it in the users hands themself to remove. If for example I deleted the my information and was prompted it takes 24-48 hours for the app the fully delete my information that would be fine, but it’s that I am requesting my information be deleted. Hence the speed not being the problem. I should be able to choose to delete the information myself not request for someone else to look into the potential deleting of the data I have given to the app.",Doesn’t let you delete yourself
1,2022-10-05 03:06:30,"Update: I continued to use an old version of the app that still had the clock and alarm and now they’ve taken that away too.  So now I’m using two different apps instead of this one. Completely senseless that they removed the two basic features of a clock and alarm. I can’t believe leaving these features would have negatively impacted the app. I’ve pleaded with their developers but they have no interest in adding these features back.   I’ve had this app for years and would have given it 5 stars up until the update when they changed the name. In fact, I recommended the app to multiple people who used to love it too. That update removed a bunch of features I used on a daily basis. Worst part is they didn’t say in the update text that they were removing features. After spending an hour trying to set my alarm and turn on the clock, I contact support and they inform me the clock has been removed. (And setting the alarm became way more complicated.) We’ll let the developers know…sorry. I had paid for the lifetime subscription and now I can’t use the app the way I want to. I held off on writing a negative review in the hopes that they would bring the deleted features back, but I guess they feel less is better. I’ll be deleting the app and looking for another one.",Used to be an Excellent app..don’t bother now
5,2018-08-20 06:22:29,"Edit: after doing some research I found the app developer’s website and emailed Ipnos. They got back to me so quickly with easy instructions for restoring my premium features. I am very satisfied with their customer service! I hope everyone who had this problem realizes that they can restore their lost functions, perhaps Ipnos should send out some kind of notice that this is happening. But anyway I am so glad for the help and that I can once again use all the sleep aids I paid for!!   —   Like another reviewer said, I had purchased the pro version of this app for $9.99. I believed that to be a permanent part of the app that I owned. The purchase included access to a huge variety of additional sleep sounds and meditations that I used regularly to help get to sleep on restless nights. But suddenly, those are no longer available to me at all and the app wants me to pay a whopping $99 to have these things accessible again?! And for how long this time? This is a really nasty way to treat the people who supported your app when there are many similar free services out there. Do not recommend.","Loved it, so disappointed now"

All is easily invoked when listening to the variety of natural sounds offered on this app.  It seems one is not at risk of insomnia, affects of blue light, radiation or other hazards of long hours and exposure using electronic equipment caused because a user is not required to look at the app long periods once sound features are selected.

5,2017-12-20 04:07:17,"It’s so hard for me to find sounds soothing enough to fall asleep to. I can’t stand the sounds of rain, crackling fire, crickets, or waves on the sleep apps. The hair dryer and vacuum are so high pitched. The oscillating fan noise drives me nuts, it’s pinpoint (narrow opening between the bars of the fan), high pitched, and inconsistent volume with the movement of the fan is so irritating. I get distracted by noises easily while trying to sleep because it’s already hard for me to fall asleep as it is without noises. I like lower frequencies or tones with wider opening sounds. I have found the underwater sound on louder volume with the Jupiter sound on low volume very soothing enough. I also like the thunder mixed with a couple other ones too. I like that you can change the volume of each sound individually. I found this app looking for sounds more like a clothes dryer (full of towels 😉) sound or air vent when the heater is on full blast. I found this and decided to try it. I’m still going to try to find an air vent sound or a clothes dryer sound (without the clanking of zippers or large items in it!), but until then, I’ll use this app.",Finally!
5,2023-02-14 15:49:40,"I’ve had a lifetime subscription to this app for several years and I Highly recommend. I have extremely sensitive hearing and I’m easily distracted or awakened. There’s countless combinations of sounds for every occasion. I listen to this app at night, when I need to concentrate, when I need to drown out annoying distractions, and in the background with audio books, etc. At night I listen to a combination of white, pink, and green noise, along with a hint of thunder, rain on the roof, and vinyl. Every sound can be adjusted individually, and the overall volume can be adjusted so that it doesn’t drown out music or audio books. I’m particularly impressed with the responsiveness of their customer service. From time to time over the years when I update my phone or the app, the settings get changed and I can’t figure out how to make it play simultaneously with other audio apps and they always walk me through how to fix it. They’ve even used my feedback to make immediate updates to the app. Like I said, I highly recommend! -Brian,   Plano, TX",Love it! Worth every penny!
5,2022-10-18 02:55:09,"I have had chronic insomnia for decades, and I was convinced that I would never get more than four hours of sleep every night. When I found this app, I was very pleased. After a few nights of trial and error, I found several meditations/hypnosis that work for me. They help me drift off to sleep, generally within fifteen minutes. (In the past, I could lay in bed, literally, for hours staring at the ceiling!)  DEVELOPERS PLEASE NOTE! I have noticed a ?change? Glitch? We once were able to click a repeat slider for each meditation so it would run overnight and kind of slide into my subconscious mind so I would “hear” it while asleep. Ever since I updated the app, the repeat button is grayed out and is inaccessible. WHY DID YOU DO AWAY WITH THAT?!? If i wake up deep in the night I have to futz with my phone(because, since no app is actively running, my phone shuts off). By the time I get the app running again I am wide awake. Which kind of defeats the purpose. DEVELOPERS PLEASE fix this!!! When it’s fixed I’ll bring my review up to five stars. Thanks for your attention.",I really like this application…
4,2023-01-10 15:03:10,"The app worked great at first, I don’t listen to music or anything when I’m trying to sleep. It told me how much REM sleep, how much light sleep and how much light sleep I got. It records every sound you make in your sleep. I learned I sneeze and talk in my sleep. It’s very interesting to discover the sounds I made, if a cat was purring or our dog barking in the middle of the night. I also discovered I sleep through the noises of the night. It suddenly stopped recording at night, I turned it on just like I have since I purchased the app. It also quit letting me know how much sleep I had. I went to Better Sleep to get help, it started working again. Now it’s back to not doing anything. I went back to Better Sleep for help again. I’m waiting for someone to reply, to walk me through the steps I need to take to get it working again. It’s a great app when it’s working properly. I don’t like to purchase anything then it suddenly stop. When it’s not working I feel like I wasted money. When it is working it’s great! I bought it to show my doctor how much restful sleep I get.

5,2023-07-21 17:08:21,"I’ve been using this app for so many years now…it just keeps getting better and better.  It’s so much fun to create sound mixes and there is an amazing selection of quality sounds.  Not only can you mix different sounds together but you can have them oscillate in and out which gives a much more realistic effect.  You can also add music into the sounds which adds yet another dimension.  There are stories and meditations and exercises and advice to check out.  I love the stories best of all.  The voices are soothing and there are a great variety of stories to choose from - something for everyone I would guess.  I love falling asleep to someone reading a bedtime story for me.  😂  I won’t lie, there are other apps out there and I think I’ve tried them all.  Some are very good but I truly think this one is best.  Here’s what I love to do: create a playlist.  I’ll start with a meditation then move to a story or two and then end with a sound mix - something like ocean waves.  It takes me through most of the night.  Fabulous!👏",Simply the Best
2,2023-07-07 06:52:32,"I’ve been using this app for years, since I was young and my dad showed it to me. I loved the interface and variability. I’ve used it throughout my childhood, tweens, teens, and into adulthood. It’s so calming to be able to create your own personalized soundtrack to a calm night, but it’s becoming less and less possible now. So many sounds I’ve been using for my custom mixes are blocked by a paywall, and I can no longer listen to the familiar sounds that have lulled me to sleep for a decade. It’s really discouraging and disappointing that so many sounds are inaccessible. I appreciate what the app is trying to do to get users to engage with their sleep patterns, but for someone who wants to simply listen to frogs croaking and a river roaring while I sleep, just like I did with my dad so many years ago, the era of this simple and free ability is gone. It makes me really sad to lose a part of my nighttime routine to paywalls, as a more and more absurd number of sounds become locked without a subscription. I wish there was an option to be able to just make sound mixes for free, or at least have more sounds accessible for free, because this app has helped me so much in the past and it’s losing a long time supporter.",More and more sounds locked by paywall
2,2022-03-12 04:11:02,"First off this app is useful for noise. Which is good for sleeping. Second, and most importantly, most sounds sound essentially the same. E.g., most the rain sounds and the fire sounds are essentially they same sound. They are the same crackling/beating sound playing at 2x speed. The fire sounds should be slower with an occasional “pop” to mimic an actual fire. As it is the fire sound is for a raging bonfire not for a fire one would sleep by. For anyone who has slept next to a fire the sound is actually slower and less furnace like. Third, the forest sounds are inaccurate. For a day time nap the sounds are good but for night time the sounds are of the forest in day time not night time. There’s no birds making sounds at night except an owl maybe. For someone who has slept in the forest and the jungle at night these sounds don’t make sense.  Lastly, stop making all of the sounds so intense. Most should be relaxing and normal. Are these recordings of actual sounds or did someone make them on a computer? If you’re going to mimic real life sounds then use real life sounds don’t make them on a computer. They sound too intense, too rushed, and too repetitive. Allow them to flow and let us enjoy the irregularity of nature.",Most sounds are the same sound
3,2021-01-29 12:40:29,"When I saw this app in the App Store I was excited, I have trouble sleeping and have stress and anxiety so when I saw this I was excited to see what it had to offer so I downloaded it and then when I went in they started to ask me some questions so I answer. Then right after they ask for my email did that THEN after they ask for my email that immediately show me a yearly subscription. It said I got a “ Payment” and at this point I just wanted to check the app out but I found out what the payment was and canceled it. When I was finally able to check out the apps content I was dumbstruck to find out.......YOU NEED TO BUY THE SUBSCRIPTION TO GET MOST OF THE CONTENT. And why is it $40 year isn’t that kinda extreme? for an app you use just for sleep? But nonetheless this app has helped me get a better sleep and a better morning and has helped my parents as well. Also despite all the locked content the sounds and music are Crispy sounding and sound like they weren’t recorded on a $15 microphone   So if you have the money buy the app but if you can’t afford just be careful so that you don’t fall into some trap and get charged for $40 dollars.

5,2020-05-04 18:06:19,we have been using this app for a while- years ago to help with sleep- and when we had our first child last year we used it to calm him down (vacuum and hair dryer is great lol) and for white noise. I loved being able to mix the brown noise with ocean waves or rain. I really think this apps sounds contributed to his better sleep! now that he’s a toddler he likes to dance to music and likes lullabies so when he’s fussy we put on something soothing for him. I love the versatility of the sounds in this app and the ability to make mixes.   recently I had uninstalled it thinking I didn’t need it anymore- then of course I did. but when I reinstalled it all of my mixes were gone and half the sounds were locked. so I messaged the developers and someone emailed me back promptly and helped me with my issues and helped restore my purchase through our apple ID so all of our old sounds were back. I was impressed by their attentiveness and glad they were able to help me and honor our previous app purchase even though we weren’t subscribers.,GREAT APP GREAT DEVELOPERS
3,2021-04-13 03:13:08,"Okay so I give it a three star rating because there is plenty of nice arrangements and sound to chose from. But I feel as if they are only purposely giving you a little amount if you don’t pay for the trial. Which makes me really sad because compared to a lot of different apps, this has much more to it and not some cheap ripoff. A lot of Meditations Which help me in the best way to get sleep, are not available because there are only 2 to repeat, and after a while it gets very disappointing to know the exact sentences that they say. As for the stories. Cute stories then again, not many to chose from. I have currently 2 CHOICES. The amount of sounds they have to put into the actual mix options is super generous considering how a lot off apps will just give you like 4 sounds in total or something insane. This app gives you 12! Which makes them give you specifically more to chose from in general. Have a nice day, or night! Really love this app otherwise! 🙂  Edit: what happened? All of its locked and its acting so laggy? All the stories i LOVED because I do the free version are GONE! why is this? Someone help me? Is it just me? :(",3 stars because..

We began at CHRISTMAS time with only the tree lights on and our kids sprinkled about the couches and rug on the floor. Meditations brought the. To near sleep each night before going to their beds. I remember the night my husband, who falls for nothing and can be near spectrum with his emotions and analytipersonality. He thought the ritual was nonsense until he sat with us. He was snoring at the end of the meditation 😂 We even watched the neighbors kids the following year during the Christmas season while their parents went to shop. They cane to gather them (12yrs and 8yrs boy and girl both with ADHD) and they came to the door with it so dark and were shocked that at 8:30pm both of their children were nearly asleep and needed help to get to the truck to go down the block 🥰 we often use the longer meditations on relaxing each part of the body to help.

When it used to take me 1 and a half hours to fall asleep, now I’m asleep within 15-30 minutes.

She doesn’t care for nature sounds and this app has plenty other options. I do like nature sounds and sneak one in there. The volume controls for individual sounds is a really nifty thought. I love how you can choose your own sounds to combine and edit volume. Makes every night a different experience, but you can also save your favorites to use for later.  Only thing that I don’t like is that I don’t have the full version. I would like access to all the sounds. I know they’ll be just as good, or better, as the ones provided for free.

I am legally blind and use this app to help me sleep, which it used to be great until they started doing some of the updates they’ve been doing. I’m not sure when the design changed, but when the design changed they left out the accessibility and also took some of the meditations. Now, because I am not able to see by phone it is very difficult and almost impossible for me to use this app because the voiceover on the iPhone no longer works on this app. They have also removed a lot of the meditations so now there is only half or less of the meditations available that used to be available when I first started using this app. This app used to be absolutely amazing and I wish the developer would put it back to the way it was and just leave things alone as far as the design and the meditations that are available. If the developer wants to add meditations and sounds that is perfectly OK, but stop making changes to the design. If it isn’t broke, don’t fix it. All of the updates you are currently doing, are making this app worthless. This last update has even made it to where when I click on meditations, there are no meditations available anymore.",Used to be great
4,2023-08-24 01:49:03,"I really like the app. I like the meditations (spoken passages that relax you), especially the shorter ones. One great feature is how they play together with the other sounds, which can continue after the meditation. So the meditation gets you to sleep and the sound keeps you that way. The negative is there are way too many taps required to do anything. To cancel a meditation after the alarm goes off and get back to the main page, for example, you have tap to cancel the alarm, tap to cancel the meditation, tap yes I'm sure, tap go back (which takes you to the group the meditation is in), tap back again (which finally leaves you on the home page). So that’s 5 taps, and worse, the taps are in different places on the screen. A saying in the early days of GUI software was “don’t mode me in.” If this program learned that lesson it would be perfect. EDIT: The developer read this and said they would address my complaint in their current round of UI revision. We’ll see, but so far looks like great customer support!",Great app but some UI problems

All around, this app is a wonderful god send. Ambient sound machines are great, but the fact that this one lets you create your own pattern and “melodies”, even save ones to return to, is just mesmerizing. You can spend hours creating perfect soundscapes! And it works with the screen locked, or even runs as a background app when you have others open! The best part is, it’s not great just for sleeping or meditating. It’s perfect for writers! Now instead of just simply envisioning your characters in certain areas, or scenes happening in specific locations, you can create all the sounds to fully emerge you in the thought process! Take you that much closer to your creations! You can even decide the volume of each individual sound in your “melody” so there are endless combinations!

Pain is often too severe even to focus on reading, watching films, or even listening to “regular” music which all too often brings back painful memories. Soothing sounds without words are incredibly useful both during therapy as well as when those who are suffering try to sleep. You have done an excellent job of providing many options for those who are truly in need to find sounds good for themselves and often quite unique. And for people who simply don’t fall asleep easily or struggle to relax, the mixes that are possible have something for everyone. My tiny therapy dogs are sleeping now as they listen to the sounds, whereas other music often alerts them.

It has always been free and will most likely always be free. No account, no emails, no marketing, nothing. Anyway, what bothered me with this app is I rejected paying for the it after it offered the 7 day trail. When I did that, it showed me a different, lower yearly price (with no context other than it was 30% off) so I clicked on it thinking it wouldn’t charge me, because of said 7 day trial. Well, it did charge me lol. So I have a refund request with apple. My real gripe is that I shouldn’t have to pay without even LOOKING at any of the apps features first, and a trial should be accessible without making a legitimate subscription. Also I poked around on the app for 5 minutes and YES it seems like it has a lot of features, but I don’t want or need any of them. So long story short, shame on me, I’m an idiot, but just be careful putting your info on the app or else you’ll get hit with a YEARLY subscription fee right off the bat.

Jessika issued me a refund and cancelled the subscription and automatic renewal. I am very pleased with the outcome.

I paid that, however, because I would finally get the Premium features of the app. For the most part, I was happy with my purchase. However, after one of the recent updates, I have had my premium benefits taken from me completely and am now being told to pay a subscription fee in order to get my premium features back. This is ridiculous. I will not pay more than the ridiculous amount I already spent. At the time I paid the $20, I was told I was making a one-time purchase...now it appears I was only being loaned the premium features.

Then I got a notice to start a free trial again way before my subscription was up, I wasn’t paying attention clicked on it and it directed me to start the annual with no restrictions, I changed and was enjoying more choices. Now the app has changed even more, the new stuff is unlocked but now most of the sounds I use to sleep with are locked. Also my subscription doesn’t end till Dec 6 and I keep getting offers to try free trial again and sign up for another annual membership. So i think they start locking stuff up so you will renew super early to get access to stuff you’ve already paid to have access too. I really enjoyed the app it was better than Calm.

I gave birth to a healthy beautiful baby girl who actually is developing faster than her age, she is three months now and almost crawling already. She does have trouble falling asleep though, she’s a feisty one when it comes to her naps.

3,2019-09-10 05:32:46,"One thing that I really loved about this app and its timer is not only could you set a count-down timer but you could also set a stop-timer; a timer that says the app will shut off at a preset time. I always want my sounds playing while I sleep. Countdown timers require me to re-set the timer every night to match the number of hours of sleep I’ll actually be getting. The stop-timer allowed me to turn the app on and let it play for any length of time, knowing it would turn off right before my alarm to get up for work. No matter if I went to sleep at 9pm or 3am I knew the sounds would play every second up until my alarm went off at 6am. The most recent update got rid of this feature and I’m really disappointed. Something that set this app apart and made it better for me than others was removed and I’m not even sure why. There was also added the ability to mix sounds with your downloaded music which would be great but I have yet to be able to get the app to play any of my music at all; not sure why it won’t which is also disappointing.",Favorite part of the timer is gone.
5,2018-07-28 12:06:21,"This is the best white noise app I’ve ever come across! The sounds are very high-quality. You can also layer the noises, and it still sounds amazing. There are so many noises to choose from, even in the free version! The sounds are unique as well. My personal favorites are cavern, wind in trees, and immersed. They have noises that don’t have melodies like river or vacuum, but they also have noises that sound more like songs, like music box and Brahms’s lullaby.  Besides the noises, this app also has many other functions I didn’t even know about when I installed it. There are timers that shut the noises off after a certain amount of time, there is a option to save your mixes if you find one you like, you can discover mixes others have made, and there are cool isochronic tones that are really subtle sounds that influence brainwaves.  In conclusion, this is an amazing, high-quality app that has a ton of features! It is more high-quality than you’d expect from the price and the pictures.",High-Quality Sounds and Function
5,2018-09-25 13:23:51,"I travel a lot and have difficulty getting good sleep because of the unfamiliarity and the noise or more appropriately, lack of noise. This app is awesome! I love that I can layer sounds, adjusting each layer’s volume. I like that I can immediately hear what adding each new sound sounds like without having to get out and come back in to make changes. I have struggled for years to find white noise options for traveling, this app is truly a lifesaver for me. I also use it at home, replacing an expensive white noise machine. I also love that I can save a bunch of different mixes and that I can label them myself. I can also make one-time changes that don’t have to be automatically added to the original mix. The free version of this app is very versatile, I’m giving great thought to investing in the Premium, just for curiosity sake; I bet it’s amazing! Just my thoughts...I like this app. I rarely write reviews and yet I purchase things with the aid of reviews, so I thought this one warranted my time.",Sleep is good...
3,2022-01-27 10:11:17,"Update: Opened the app again and all the free content though very minimal compared to the rest was available for me to use again. So it seems there was a glitch of some sort so I’m going from One Star to Three for the free content. If I paid for it then I would rate the full content accordingly.   Downloaded this app several years ago and was content with the very limited content since ultimately it was to get you hooked and pay for more content. But recently had to re-download it after changing phones and now ALL my sound mixes I made over a year ago are locked and I have to pay for them. Not only that but they reduced the “free” stories from 4 to 2, and the meditations that were free also are less. There are now only 3 free sounds which is a complete joke and waste of my time. The description in the App Store should say, “Sample content”. I only have used this app to help with my occasional insomnia but now looks like I’m going to find a different solution since when they update they lock you out BUT they don’t tell you this in the “Free” app.",Nothing is Free!

I just recently signed my dad up because he was going through lots of nervousness and anxiety since he was diagnosed with throat cancer. So i told him this app helped me to relax and sleep. Especially at night i had hard time. So my dad cancer has gotten to be a challenge for him and his been in and out of the hospital. So since i uploaded and had him subscribe to it. He hasn't turned it off. He specifically listens to the same tune and it is helping him to calm down. This cancer has not been kind to my dad and he has  3 tumors growing on his esophagus and trachea so its he has difficulty breathing at times because its narrowing his airway. Im i  the hospital at his bed side and the music is playing. He likes the flute sound and i mixed  it with the wave sounds and thunder.

I like selecting a mix of different sounds and creating my own sounds to listen to, the quality of the app is fantastic.  However, I purchased something that was supposed to not expire a while ago and it’s now disappeared. It was at least a year ago, but there was a deal going where you could buy the pro version of the app for $9.99 and it would never expire. I logged onto the app today and some of the sounds that I had previously owned have now gone back to being up for purchase. Granted, I hadn’t used the app in a couple weeks due to being gone while working or being unable to listen for some reason, but I’m disappointed because the only reason I paid the $10 for the pro version was because it was a one-time purchase and I would have access to the whole app.  Other than this, the app is fantastic and I highly recommend it",Love it but disappointed

Noises, light, and certain repetitive motions from others gives me horrible crippling anxiety and flashes of rage. Anytime I’m overwhelmed I put this app on. Anytime I try to sleep, this app is playing through my headphones. If I’m studying, or even trying to block out a neighbor’s irritating voice, this app is my go-to. Highly recommend it because you can decide exactly how much and what kind of sound is produced. You create your very own haven within the app. Sometimes I need to fuss with the levels depending on the location or what kind of noise I’m trying to block out. This app makes that simple, and you can even save the creation. I have one for a favorite coffee shop with a whiny coffee grinder, I have one for when I’m sleeping over at my care job, I even have one to play over my own music while I’m walking through town.

White noise used to help me, and nature sounds did— on a machine I had— but the sound quality wasn’t all that great and the sounds ran in loops, which were distracting. The ones here are not run in loops and so I don’t get distracted and annoyed. I’m Keeping this app and I’ve been recommending it to friends even though I just started using it 3 nights ago!

You can save all your mixes with up to 15 layers of sounds, and name each mix. Want to sleep to the sounds of camping on a beach in the Pacific Northwest?

I have not slept so well and been so happy to wake up. I haven’t even hit snooze! No need! I’m so happy waking up to the sounds of mermaids singing to me. I like seeing the sleep tracking reports.

5,2022-12-11 08:26:47,I’ve never been hypnotized and definitely did not believe I could be effectively hypnotized through an app. I was having trouble falling asleep for a few nights in a row and was so exhausted and sleep deprived having to get up and go to work anyways. I just wanted to go to sleep but I couldn’t seem to get my mind to stop racing. Even sleep meditation ASMR or my trusty AC window unit sound on my noise machine app weren’t doing the trick. I thought maybe it was time for me to try a new sleep-inducing medium. I was intrigued by the idea of sleep hypnosis and quickly signed up for the free trial of this app. I listened to the River of Sleep hypnosis episode and found myself pleasantly freaked out by how much it worked. There are times when I forgot that I was in my bed with my eyes closed. I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of the episode. I’ve been listening to episodes for the last three nights in a row and can’t get over how ethereal the experience is.,Hypnosis No Joke

The new feature Selection makes it easier to adjust the volume of different sounds in the mix. Navigation can be tricky. The sounds aren’t in any sort of order that I can see. And if I find a meditation I like but don’t write down the name it’s hard to find again quickly. The new option to save a Mix is great solution for that but I have keep restoring my purchase so I lose my mixes.

4,2018-08-02 05:03:27,"I was bummed when my iOS 9 upgrade hosed my faithful Yocto Clock alarm app. After much research I decided to give the Relax app a try.  The alarm has been reliable after about 2 months of use. I wish it had the option to program multiple days' alarm like so many other apps. It's a pain to have to remember to turn it on each night. I also wish the alarm snooze/off window would pop up on the lock screen instead of needing to swipe to unlock and then snooze or turn it off.  The interface is unique and attractive but could be more intuitive. Sound mixing and editing is difficult to figure out. But the app makes up for it in the amount of choices offered. Groovy sounds , guided meditations (the voices are dubbed too loudly in the forefront of the audio IMO) , and relaxing beats and sounds are all fun to experiment with.  Buying the $9.99 lifetime subscription will remove the cumbersome ad in the bottom bar and give you something like 108 sounds.

If I play a sound the white noise, or other color noises, the binaural beats and solfeggio frequencies, those I can rely on not to have a break in the sequence, it's just a nice, relaxing, soothing, calming, and consistent soundscape for my brain. It allows my brain to do its thing, for me to get an uninterrupted nap, and not feel the irritation of the sounds ""starting over"" on repeat. I LOVE this app, truly!

Tbh my friend is the one who recommended me this app and I love it! I only have one complaint though but its not a big one: I wish a little more of the meditation recordings thingys were free instead of the “pro” because I enjoy the free ones and they really help me but I am not even a teenager yet so I can’t really earn money easily for this app and this is a really long review so I will stop now but I totally understand and thank you so much for creating this app I am in love!!!

4,2017-11-04 06:36:54,"It's an extremely efficient app. I truly do fall asleep before many of the meditation exercises fully end. There's one or two provided each week, which is more than enough to lull me to sleep. However, if you wish to use all of the meditations, you will have to pay. Personally, I haven't looked very far into the prices because I am satisfied with what is given, but I realize that a cost to use more than two meditations per week may turn some people off.  Edit: I'm currently very disappointed. I have been using the Introductory Path to Better Sleep for months on end. Day 5 continuously lulls me to sleep. However, tonight, upon starting the app, I noticed that it is now a pro feature. I am extremely upset. That specific meditation had become a part of my routine, and due to my disability, it is uncomfortable for changes in my routine to take place.

I deactivated my old account & deleted the app because I wanted to live without it since I slept better, but times I needed the app again. I redownloaded as a result & suddenly I have the free sounds. I saw the sweet hour prayer locked and felt bad even the other ones I've had immense dreams with. After hearing the ones I heard now (because I heard them too), it took me back to the dreams I had when I fell asleep with the sounds.

I remember from the middle (a little of the beginning) and mostly the ending of my dreams, so I can picture them thanks to the sounds.

I like the sound of rain, (I have a metal roof and live in the Midwest so lots of thunderstorms) I like the sound of soothing music, and I like the sounds of night time bugs.

Before I had this app, I had never tried yoga nidra, and the guided yoga Nidra sessions and series on this app have been life-changing. I love the calming expressive voice of Aster J. Haile. My heart is constantly touched by the thoughtfulness and subtlety and care with of the yoga nidra meditations on this app.  Also, the 7 minute sleep meditations for children are fantastic. I play two of them for my son, almost every night, for a total of 15 minutes, and every night it helps him relax and go to sleep.  Some of the sleep stories are delightful too. I love the celebration of nature and old sleepy landscapes worldwide that are to be found in the stories.   There are many amazing resources on this app, and sometimes it can be a little hard to navigate, so if there is one piece of feedback I have, it is to improve the organization on the site, to that an outline display is an option, to make specific meditations easier to find.

4,2018-08-04 05:09:36,"iTunes won’t let me just delete my initial review, so I’ll update: I found the older meditations. Almost the entire app interface was changed and the meditations were reorganized in such a way that not all of the sleep-related meditations we’re located together anymore. The older meditations, even if they are related to the new ones, seem to have all been moved to a section together that you don’t even come across unless you scroll past all the categories you would expect to find them under. They’re buried.  I’m grateful they are there, but it is unfortunate they were moved to a far less accessible place. I will have to get used to the updated version of the app and see if I can find a way to make them more easily accessible. No one wants to click all over to find something when they need to get to sleep.  I appreciate the developer’s response to my reviews. Because they care and because the meditations are there, I increased my rating from one-star. But the more complicated organization of the app compared to how it used to be and the seemingly random placement of the older meditations keeps it from being five-stars.  The CONTENT is GREAT. The organization of that content is my only issue.  Old review: This was my go-to for falling asleep, but they changed all of the meditations. The ones that worked for me are all gone from the app and were replaced by new ones all done by the same woman. I can’t relax, let alone fall asleep to her voice.",Odd Organization

5,2018-06-15 07:06:41,"I suffer from a multitude of things, insomnia being problematic since I was a toddler. At first I just wanted a nighttime white noise-variety app. But one night I tried out a meditation and fell asleep within minutes, which is extremely unusual for me. I tried a couple more and ended up paying 20 for the full app since I was limited to just one meditation a day with the free version ... and I’m not a fan of every single meditation, so I wanted to be able to switch if I want, or listen to a couple if I REALLY can’t sleep. The sounds are good quality, customizable, and very soothing. The meditations have been truly life changing for me, as I can now fall asleep peacefully in 5-30 minutes as opposed to 1-4 hours most nights.

3,2023-11-01 14:11:23,"I find this app is almost great, but there are a few critical problems that make me regret purchasing the subscription.  Firstly, and most importantly, the alarm just doesn’t go off sometimes.   I know without a doubt how to set up the alarm and use the features within it, and several times in the month since I got this app the alarm just doesn’t go off at all and I sleep in way too late - again I’m 100% certain Im using the alarm feature properly and this problem is a deal breaker for me.   If it doesn’t get resolved I will not be using this app in the future, as the gentle alarms were by far the most attractive feature that brought me to the app in the first place.   Second, I think the sounds are great but I don’t know why you can only use the “mixes” when you start the sleep tracker and you don’t get access to the full sound library anymore. (Maybe I’m missing something).  Third, I feel like the sleep metrics are a bit bs… maybe there’s something I’m not privy to in the world of sleep science tech - but I don’t understand how you can really gather all of that “data” using a microphone alone… Not to mention I scored a 96 on my sleep this morning, but I did not sleep that well and the alarm failed to go off so I just didn’t “end” the sleep session on the app for a while after I already had woken up.   Anyways, like I said, almost a great app. If these problems are fixed then maybe it won’t feel like I wasted my money.",Bug fixes!!! Please address
4,2018-11-09 19:27:31,"I was looking for a white noise app for my baby but both me and my husband hate traditional white noise, so i wanted something more soothing/tolerable for us since she still sleeps in our room. After downloading and trying a bunch of sound apps I decided on this one because of the sounds and functions it has. I love that you can select multiple sounds to play at the same time, adjust the volume of each sound individually, and save mix to your profile. I have the app on my phone and iPad and logging in allows me to use either one and have the same mixes saved.  Overall I definitely recommend this app, but will say there are two small downsides.  #1 there are A LOT of sound options, maybe too many in my opinion. It can be overwhelming when trying to put together sounds ""should I pick wind or breeze? Ocean or waves?!?"".  #2 there is no timer in the free version which is the only part of the paid version I'm interested in. Not a huge deal but would be nice to have.",Great app
1,2018-09-17 05:38:36,"I NEVER write reviews. I have been a long time fan of this app since it’s very first days. Then they introduced the meditation and sleep frequencies and it was all I needed, all in one place, so I purchased the premium version. I haven’t used it for a while but came back to realize they monetized it all further and made all the sounds I paid for only available via subscription. How could you just revoke the  privileges I paid for and now charge each month for certain sounds/frequencies instead? I bought it when it was a one time purchase for the audio loops, as it should be. With a background in tech it’s so easy to see this has purely become a money grab. All it is is audio snippets...that I already paid for! You don’t see musicians charging per month on individual albums! Don’t act like a music steaming service and charge per month. It’s just a shame to see the developers go from sensible people to selfish and senseless scammers. You no longer care about helping people, only about making money. Keep my money, idc. The history of this app proves you represent all that’s wrong in the world. And for that, it’s a no from me dawg.",Sad to see it’s become a money grab
5,2018-05-28 06:05:20,"This app is great for putting together sounds that fit my needs.  I do meditate, but I also sleep and nap. I have yet to try the meditations ones, butI look forward to trying new ones.  I love that one does not have to pay for every single new sound. I used SleepPillow and was aggravated with it.  I also used Windy.  I love it, but it was confusing andI spent so much.  So, I have created now a sound for daytime naps and night time!  Once I created them, I got to name them.  How cool is that.  I love it.  I only wish it was easier to turn off.  Navigation took me a little bit, but was worth it.  I like the set up now that I get it.  Time for sleep!  Love it!!  Okay, a month later, and I have purchased the whole package.  I am using the meditation programs and I love the update!  This app has helped me meditate and sleep more effectively and easily.  I still love it.  Worth paying for the extras.  I can not believe the quality of this app. It is great.",Finding Sounds
5,2022-02-16 11:19:31,"I’ve been struggling with sleep for a long time. I take melatonin almost every night, but when stress/anxiety get too high, I have a hard time shutting my brain off. I enjoy the ability to create my own sound, depending on my mood. I used the trial version for a few days before getting the subscription. I really like the freedom to tailor the sounds to my own unique needs. I’ve been using this app for about a week and I can already tell a difference in my sleep patterns. Most days I wake up a little more refreshed. I’m learning which sound bytes not to use during the week just because I feel like I sleep deeper than I ever have. Overall, it’s a great app. If you’re like me a have stress/anxiety in your life or even struggle shutting your brain off at night, I’d definitely give this app a try. By far one of the best apps I’ve found to help promote sleep and meditation.",Great for busy minds
5,2018-12-04 05:41:09,"***Edit 04Dec2018.  The developer was on top of this one.  I was sent an email with clear instructions on how to fix my problem.  It worked and I now have the full app.  I’m really excited that they took the time to explain how to fix my problem.  For the record I never reached out to them with my concerns.  It’s really nice that they’re actually looking at the reviews.  I’m upgrading my review to five stars.  Excellent app, but I was frustrated when I thought I has lost everything.  I realize now that it was my mistake, and they were very proactive and professional in regards to restoring the app for me.  *********************************************************  Due to an incident where I had too much to drink and couldn’t figure out how to shut off this app I inadvertently purchased the $99 app.  Mad - yes, but it was completely my fault.  Lesson learned.  Fast forward a few months and now this stupid app is no longer giving me access to the “options” (insert a cuss word) that I purchased.  Granted the app did have some almost cool stuff - for THE FEW WEEKS I HAD IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Careful spending $100 on this junk because they’ll get amnesia and say you never purchased the app.  Won’t use foul language but there are some fairly explicit words I’m thinking right now.  This wasn’t a purchase it was renting an app for a few weeks.  So stupid!!",Worst Mistake (short of my first speeding ticket)
5,2019-01-18 03:56:09,"I have trouble sleeping, so I often turn to meditation apps to play background noise . It also helps quiet my bird and he sleeps peacefully, too. I have tried countless apps before finally finding this one! You can buy premium, and there aren’t many adds that I’ve seen, but it doesn’t  force you to pay to use it. I LOVE the create your own sound feature, which is free! I think it’s way better than other apps that play sound because I can adjust exactly what mood I’m in or where I imagine myself to be, and I sleep peacefully. I have so much praise for this app. The meditation feature is also really great, because I am very stressed and suffer from anxiety and depression, and meditation helps calm my mind. Love it, life it, love it.

5,2022-10-22 07:51:05,"10/21 - Developer released patch and couple days ago,  and it fixed the issue. Very happy to be able to use this app again. I swear at this point it’s a Pavlovian response. I turn on one of the stories in this app and I’m asleep within 10 minutes. Try “2am at the blueberry hill diner”. Very soothing story. Will put you to sleep in minutes.   I pay for the yearly subscription because I find the stories help my fall asleep when the white noise sounds don’t work. But now suddenly it won’t work. I’ve gotten into a routine finally that as soon as I get into bed. I turn on this app and play this dumb sorting game and I’m out in like 5 minutes. As someone with chronic insomnia so bad it affects my ability of do my job, this app was the only thing that helped. As soon as I open the app it crashes and I didn’t even do the update. Extremely disappointed it won’t work.",Was a great App
1,2017-12-06 06:33:27,"I have always been very afraid of the dark, something about not being able to see is just too uncomfortable for me. This fear leaves me with insomnia. It’s a fancy word for saying I can’t sleep. When I first got the app it worked great. The meditations were really relaxing, but you only get two or three songs free, or you have to buy the pro version. I didn’t mind replaying the meditations over and over again since I wasn’t really listening to them, they were back round noise for comfort. But after a while the voices didn’t stop my brain from constantly flittering from thought to thought. I decided to use the sounds. The sounds are little sounds like “rain”, “heavy rain”, “zen” “waterfall”, etc. You can combine different ones to Make something just for you. But Again most of the songs needed the pro version, although the first combination they show you is “rain”, “night”, and “eternity”. I was really able to be washed over in a state of peace with the mix, But it is fun mixing different sounds to see what works for you. Over all the app has it’s sore spots, but it really has helped me get to sleep faster and better.",Not bad ( sorry it so long)
5,2021-11-22 16:08:21,"I’ve had a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep for a while. I tried this app a few months ago and it worked magic LOL. It worked so good I had to get the Premium version and it was the best decision ever. I find that the stories and meditations help me fall asleep faster. I think it’s because I’m focused on the stories/meditations so I’m not laying in my bed worrying about other stuff. Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night I can’t fall back asleep, so I just put on another story/meditation to go back to sleep. Another thing I really like is the Sounds/Music. I love that there are dozens of sounds I can choose from, and that I can add different sounds and make them louder or softer depending on what I like. ( and I can save my mixes so I can listen to them again). Overall, I absolutely love this app and recommend it to anyone who has a hard time falling/staying asleep.",LOVE
5,2023-02-20 09:50:06,"I have been dealing with insomnia ever since becoming a college student. Being away from home, and not feeling as protected as you were being home is really a challenge while trying to go to sleep. Every single noise in your dorm or apartment keeps you up, and it became a real issue for me, I would find myself watching the sun come up for many nights. Ever since getting this app I am able to fall into a deep sleep within five minutes tops. I love the freedom of being able to customize your own personal sound and to also throw in a soothing song in the mix. At first I was OK with what they gave me for free, but I realized that this app actually has helped me get amazing sleep throughout the whole night, and immediately invested in their premium plan. $39 a month is unbeatable when you are getting uninterrupted sleep every single night.",Truly better sleep
5,2023-03-30 08:12:54,"My family and I come from an OG line of white noise users, as we still use traditional machines at the bedside. As my kids have gotten older and we’re spending the night at friends houses, they felt goofy carting around a whole machine, and as my husband and I have been traveling with only carry-on luggage space, this app has been great for us. Obviously the fact that you can always change it up whenever you want being the star of this app, soooooo many combinations at your fingertips including the different dream mghz (?), I also appreciate some of the bugs being worked out. For instance, it used to pause the white noise during a notification but it no longer does that. Thankfully. That was almost a deal breaker.

The app also helped us get the kids to bed when they were younger and manage some night terror issues when they surfaced. I love the timer and sleep functions on this thing and I am now exploring the meditations. I love this thing. My only complaint is that I once paid for the upgrade and it did not transfer over to the new phone but I think that's on me. Not sure what that was about. The free version takes care of all our needs and once I figure out the meditations a little better I will probably buy the upgrade again. Great job. This app used to be ok and good but it has gotten better and better over time.  Update: paid for it a second time cuz it was worth it. Updates to new new phone without a problem.

2,2021-07-23 21:45:28,"This app clearly started small, with only a few features, and as they added features to appeal to their growing users, they never really updated the frame work.  Nothing is properly organized. Some music is in the “music” tab, while the rest is in the mix tab and are labeled “melodies”. The sounds’ organization is off, too. If you want to reach your custom mixes (the whole point of the app) you have to look under your account settings, of all things!  There’s so little offered to free members it’s honestly a bit insulting. Two or three sounds in each category, and no music. Only one asmr. No bedtime stories, meditations, or noises for newborns.   Then they have the audacity to force you to pay for an entire year’s subscription! You only wanna try a month? Too bad. 40 bucks or nothing. You can’t even try any of the functionality through the free service, something that’s SUPPOSED to act in that exact way.  The “sleep support” is literally just a multiple choice question asking how well you slept last night. It remembers what sounds you were listening that night to recommend them later. I can make that in Apple Shortcuts in a half hour. 40 bucks.  That being said… I paid them those 40 bucks and use it every night. The sounds (the premium ones anyway) are really, really nice and diverse. If you pay for premium, you get fun sounds like sci-if brain scanners and underwater ambience. The music is nice, too.",Really mediocre UI experience (and don’t bother if you don’t have 40 bucks)
5,2023-04-05 12:57:30,"I love this App, everything about it… but I wish the recordings were longer rather than only 6-8 seconds long.  I practice lucid dreaming and I log my dreams, and there are times when I wake up from a dream and I want to remember it the next day so my way to do it is say out loud a word or two about it, so it gets recorded, and then I can go back to the recording the next day and remember to log it.  Many times, while using this app, the words haven’t even been recorded for how short each segment is, and I lose the dream.  Is there a way to make them at least 15-20 seconds long?  I understand this would mean more storage but it would be great.  I also use an app called Sleep Talk which records everything while there’s sound, without interruption, maybe it would be worthwhile checking it out and try to improve on time length.",Longer Recordings

They have sounds to fit almost everyone’s needs from a few different white noise levels (ie pink, brown) to Tibetan monk chanting. I usually use a mix of water sounds with white noise to knock me out because I’m a basic beach but they have a lot of sounds that I never would’ve even though of using to sleep (and I mean that in the best way possible)!

When I wake up to fix it, the app still shows that it’s playing. Even upon stopping and hitting the play button again, the sound does not work. It isn’t until I completely close out the app and go back in that it will work again. If this is a bug that can be fixed, I will update my review to 5 stars because it really is an excellent app. I am autistic and have Sensory Processing Disorder so sleeping has always been an issue.

I have recommended it to several people during my travels and it has helped the people with the quality of their sleep or concentration where I hear how it's made their days and nights better. It is simply enjoyable and the simplistic interface allows all users to just enjoy the present without the hassle of unintuitive technology. I'm very happy that this app version I got is free and grateful that it is. Create your own combo of sounds (sounds I would have never thought of adding if I had made an app like this) accompanied with sleep timers and settings to save your fav combos.

I used the App Store and found Relax Melodies!

I have had no problems falling into a deep relaxed state and gone to sleep with a smile on my face in less than 5 minutes while listening to these sounds that I love so much.

It's so much more pleasant than either of the two physical machines in my room. When you live in a busy town and/or are tortured by anxiety, you can require many layers of sound to fall asleep. This app really does it all. You can adjust the volume for each specific sound. Combine notes and ambience. Save your favorites. My toddler loves it too! I offer him a ""lullaby"" at bedtime which is usually one of the soothing songs Butterfly or Medieval. Then he picks which noises his little heart desires, with help of course.

Now, I select a story to listen to, pop on my sleep mask, and within minutes, my mind stops racing, I feel so relaxed, and I’ve found that I’ve been falling asleep within 15-20 mins now. I’m so grateful. The year subscription cost is totally worth it. My only two cons: 1.) I wish they added new stories regularly — like at least weekly —because at the rate I’m going, I’ve basically already listened to most of the ones with voice artists I like. 2.)

Very odd and I hope the help button gets fixed soon so I can get back to my favorite sounds.  Edit: I got a quick response from the developer!

Honestly, it has several good qualities and decent sounds. However, I have a problem: the sounds cutting out randomly and not coming back on until I close and re open the app. It also lags when I re open the app. It then does it again until I give up on using the app and try to sleep myself.

Aside from it not having enough free sounds and stories, I think the app is amazing!!  EDIT: thank you for responding!! I think I was a little harsh the first time I reviewed, I learned a lot more about this app since. I think it deserves 5 stars, for what it’s worth.

There was literally only two free ones. $40 is ridiculous to pay for an app. There dozens of locked ones but ya had to lock those two stories available. Real horrible of you.  Used to be an amazing app until everything become locked.  Stop locking the only few available things that used to be free for ages. Very very disrespectful to the people who are in a pattern of falling asleep to those same exact sounds every night or so. Which includes me. It’s not lovely to realize I can’t use the app anymore like I’ve been using for a long time. What’s the point of locking those? And no I won’t do a free week trial because then everything will be locked once again. Not ONE STORY OR MEDITATION IS AVAILABLE FREE. Change it back to how you had it a few days ago. Can’t advertise a free app but make 3/4 unavailable Unless paying the subscription price. This became such a pointless app.,I really do love the app but STOP LOCKING THE ONLY FREE THINGS
5,2022-01-20 14:36:00,"I bought a subscription over a year ago, and it’s the best app subscription I’ve ever had. I think it’s better if the sounds come from a tablet so that our phones can still be used for other things. I use it during the day and at night. I get the best sleep at night, it’s so calming. And you can create your own mix of sounds to perfect the mood you’re going for. It can create a great source of ambient noise in my super quiet apartment, with out me having to turn on a fan or the TV. This helps a lot with my anxiety. Couple things I wish the app would do is organize the sounds alphabetically by their names. It would be cool to also get a few more diverse sounds for birds, like a morning dove.  The bedtime stories are also really good bc the voice actors are calm and they really do put you to sleep.",So many sounds to choose from

Anyway, like most people, I was at work so didn’t have time to go through my emails and update everything in my life that very moment. Instead of giving me a couple days, they automatically renewed it for a YEAR a few hours later, and charged me almost $70. They couldn’t even have been decent and done like a week for $3 and TELL me what was happening, instead of just CHARGING me for a whole extra YEAR! I never received a single notification letting me know my subscription was ending, either. I don’t have 70 extra dollars just lying around, especially not NOW during COVID. I immediately cancelled my subscription but now I am missing $70. At least I’ll get some sleep sounds for a year!? Ugh. Thanks, guys.",Kinda irritated

3,2020-12-11 07:53:55,Update: I changed from one star to 3 because I LOVE this app so much I paid the premium single payment for a lifetime subscription over a year ago and used to rave about this app. In fact I highly recommended it in an episode about meditating on my podcast. Then I discovered recently all my options were locked unless I upgrade to the yearly $60 fee!  I was so mad I deleted the app altogether. But the developer commented on my review about how to restore my subscription which I have done and it seems all my options are back. I do love this app but I think the developers have crossed a line making it so expensive to new subscribers. The free version is basically useless since just about everything is locked so I’m super grateful to have my lifetime subscription restored. Honestly $5 a month for an app seems like no big deal until you add in other subscriptions on top of other bills. It’s too bad it’s now out of price range for many people.,Original lifetime subscription restored
4,2023-10-27 15:22:33,"I love this powerful functionality - the ability to create my own mixes and layer in other things like music and sleep stories from an ever growing library is a dream come true My only issue is that it can be frustrating to navigate - I really wish there were some kind of search functionality. I spend a lot of time trying to find sounds or meditations I saw or liked before - and I've made and saved mixes in the past that I loved but I can't find anywhere (only my most recent saved mixes show up in the favorites area under mixes) - one other little pet peeve is sometimes mid-use the app will glitch and forget that I've got a paid subscription, so little lock icons appear on a lot of the content til I close and reopen the app. Overall though I use this a lot and love and recommend it to others.","Love it every night, a little cumbersome to navigate"
5,2021-11-23 16:56:30,"I’ve been using this app for several years and I have loved the updates they’ve added. When I first started using it I was only using it as a fancy sound machine at night. (Which it does exceptionally well.) More recently my biggest value from this app comes from the bedtime stories and nightly meditations. They’ve been awesome helping our elementary age boys transition to sleep at night. I also really enjoy listening to the built-in music mixes during the day while I’m working. I also throw in a mindfulness meditation break every now and then for good measure. I was motivated to write this review because I just noticed the app has been rebranded to focus on sleep. It does a great job with helping that aspect, but I would like to point out that it also has value for other applications.",Love it! It’s not only for great sleep!
4,2022-08-25 10:17:47,"*Update/Feedback 2* Issues with my subscription every year. After a payment the app shows that my plan is free AND deletes all of my saved favs. Since the UI has been redesigned, the ‘how to restore purchases’ instructions dont help. Currently I’m un/reinstalling. Kind of annoying bc I’m using this app when I wake up and go to sleep, times where I don’t want to be troubleshooting tech.   ***Update/Feedback* I’d really like it if some of the sounds were slower. Ex. Slime, ice in a glass, vinyl crackle. They sound like they have a fast pace if that makes sense. There doesn’t need to be so many crackles per second. Insomnia almost solved. This app provides a comprehensive tool box for using sound therapy to regulate my mood and focus. I use sounds in the AM to “wind up” for my day and was aspiring to create a PM “wind down”. This beautifully designed app provides me motivation to do so. I love using it.",Worth the Purchase
5,2020-10-03 05:54:57,"I have been using this app since it was Launched. This app by far is the most consistent app that is around today, I have never had to call customer service, the sounds are SO REALISTIC! This app has gotten me through some hard times mentally and emotionally, I would be lost if I did not have this app, I have this app on 24 hours a day, there is a home theater system simply dedicated to RELAX MELODIES, there is a Bluetooth speaker in every room of my house , and I always keep them tuned as to where, you may be watching tv, or relaxing you can slightly hear it in the background, my favorite combo is Fire Crackle, Highway, and heavy winds, that is what I have playing all day and night in my home, it never goes off! Other than being absolutely tired, this is the ONLY thing that helps me sleep at night! THANK YOU SO MUCH❤️ You have helped me sleep for almost 10 years.",Best App Ever!
5,2018-05-12 04:49:46,I was diagnosed with insomnia and anxiety at the beginning of the year. Since then I have tried dozens of apps to help with my sleep and relaxation and this app really helped! There are so many different sounds that range from everyday sounds to the sounds of natural settings that you can customize yourself to create your mix. I truly enjoy this because it transports me into a space that I want to be in at any moment. But there are also premise mixes that come with the app that are also nice. Unlike many other apps that aid with sleep and relaxation you don’t have to pay for anything. Some apps you have to start paying for things you have gotten used to for a few days then they slap you with a charge for things you’ve been already using! Love that relax melodies does not do that. Also love that there’s a timer that times out of the app.,Helped my Insomnia!
3,2020-08-05 03:30:52,"I used to use this app every night.  You’re able to customize the sounds, which I love.  I have a specific combo that I created and have been using every single night for years.  My boyfriend has the same specific combo on his phone too.  I used to play an audiobook on Audible and the sounds from this app as I fell asleep.  I would set the Audible sleep timer for 15-30 minutes and then this app would stay on during and past that so that I wouldn’t wake up as easily during the night from noise in my apartment building’s hallway.  Unfortunately, a recent change to the app made it so I can’t play both Audible and this app at the same time.  So if I want to listen to an audiobook to fall asleep, the sounds won’t be on throughout the night.  This app used to be 5 stars for me and I recommended it to a lot of people, but this change has made it a lot less helpful and I’m using it less frequently now.","Used to be perfect, but now I can’t use it as much"
5,2018-01-20 09:42:42,"First got this app 8 years ago when I was still in high school for studying and relaxation and kept it since. Also great for meditation, sleeping, setting a vibe for different activities. Great variety of sounds, you can select as many as you want, mix all the volume levels separately, add binaural beats, set timers, etc... it makes great ambient sound for just about anything. High quality audio and the loops are quite undetectable, especially when you layer sounds. Since the loops are different lengths the result of combining them is a seemingly infinitely progressing track. It had a lot less features when I first got it but still was awesome. It’s pretty amazing to see the app so expanded now  it has like 5 times more sounds now than when I first got it. Think they might need to install a search bar if they want to add anymore sounds. Thanks!",Fantastic and flexible
4,2021-10-15 05:02:44,"TLDR; Wonderful app but have to come here and rate to unlock all the sounds despite paying for the full version.  I would give it five-stars, but to unlock all the sounds (even after paying for it) I still have to rate it to unlock a few. It’s not awful of them, just kind of on the same vein of having an advertisement wall after already paying. But the stories alone are worth the price, they’re lovely and help me take my mind off things/slow down my thoughts enough to shut down. If you don’t want to pay for the full version, the free version still has a few stories and meditations available to listen. Their sound library is enough for several favorites to be saved and they’re all made of completely different sounds. I’d ask to consider if you’re on the look for a relaxation app. Hope it helped!",Best sleep aid app I’ve found. (And it’s free)
5,2022-10-24 05:18:00,Ok I’m not paid to say this. I always have the biggest issues falling asleep. I mean I can never sleep with out some kind of pill or supplement to sleep. And melatonin doesn’t work. Sleep aids don’t work. The only thing that put me to sleep was antipsychotics or and edible which I can’t always get. Then I used this app. No drugs nothing. Just the green noise and some other noises which this app has dozens of different calming sounds. And I went to sleep in less than an hour. This app paired with my smart bulb set to low on red light and I fall right asleep every night. Down load this app of you have trouble sleeping and you don’t want to use chemicals to sleep it will change and improve your life so much. 10 out of 10. Would give this six stars if I could.,This is a game changer. I would give it six stars if I could.
5,2022-03-04 12:57:13,"I really enjoy this app. I bought lifetime subscription long time ago. Since first days of release… the app improved a lot. It used to be just sounds. Now they have stories, meditations, music… wow 👏 Good job developers! It’s a great relaxing app. Love it! But unfortunately there is a small bug. It doesn’t bother me, but it might be annoying for others. Sometimes when I open the app it doesn’t remember my subscription status and everything gets locked again. I have to to “restore purchase” and restart the app for everything to get unlocked again. It’s doing this about every two days. Just something to look into. :) But other than that it’s a great relaxing app. Helps me fall asleep every night. And I have trouble falling asleep. Again Great Job and Thank you for this app. :)",Relaxing and simple
4,2023-03-31 03:25:12,"i really love this app. it makes me fall asleep way faster than before and i feel alot calmer and relaxed. i also love the option for it too wake you up ""softly"" instead of using your regular loud alarm. that option slowly plays music and slowly gets louder for the time you set it to until you stop it. and its not so loud where you wake up abruptly, like your usual alarm, but the music slowly wakes you up, take you out of your dream, and slowly awake to the calming music. BUT i do have to say there is very limited options for sounds too choose to fall asleep/wake up too. id say theres 25% unlocked sounds and lots of locked sound which you have to pay monthly for. which i will not be doing. AND it also gives you the option to record your sleep but theres no point because you have to pay to hear the recordings monthly again.",pretty good
5,2021-03-22 12:09:57,I have been enjoying the free selections on this app for several months and I have grown to enjoy them so much they benefit my falling asleep they benefit when life is stressful and I just need to have some calm sounds or calm meditation to help me through that difficult moment during the day. I enjoy it in the mornings of my days off when I want to have a slow start to the day and not be overwhelmed with all the things on my to do list at the moment I wake up so to move slowly into the day makes the day off so much better. I just said yes to one of the promotional offers and I think this app is worth every penny for how much it enhances my life in the direction that I want it to go which is in a calmer more peaceful more balanced state no matter what time of the day or night.,After months of free use finally joined
5,2019-07-18 03:47:08,"(I am currently 16, but have used this app since I was 13 years old and decided I wanted to review it only to find this draft from 3 years ago, which still sums up my thoughts about it) I am a 13 y/o and I have a lot of stress in my life and often have trouble falling asleep or relaxing, but this app helps me eliminate this problem almost completely and it's free too which is even better! And another thing I like is that you can mix sounds and the sounds aren't pre-set to certain groups so you can get the exact sound that you want. The one thing I would add to this is the ability to save your sound creations (which has indeed been implemented so ignore this part) because I find it a little difficult to recreate a sound I have made in the past but that's not a huge issue in my mind. So overall great app, I LOVE it and it is SO helpful :)",PERFECT
5,2022-05-01 09:53:27,"Edit several years later: Still use it sporadically! One of only a handful of apps that I can’t ever justify deleting because while I don’t use it regularly, the times that I do need it are during a sleep emergency.  Original: Initially downloaded it when I was trying to find a white noise app to fall asleep to on a plane. Unfortunately I waited until we were boarding the plane before downloading the pile of random apps to test out. I think I had 3 or 4 fully loaded on my phone before we took off- what I didn’t realize is that most of them were streaming apps and therefore required WiFi/internet/whatever continuously in order to work! Relax Melodies (mostly) does not. I still use it sometimes when I have a hard time falling asleep. Two thumbs up, about to use it again.",Very good
4,2023-10-11 12:35:24,The developer reached out on my concerns and they are going to be getting it fixed!   This app has improved my sleep quality tenfold!! I can actually fall asleep in a decent amount of time and stay asleep all night long feeling refreshed when I wake up.   Original: I wish when you create a playlist you had the same options to do a mixer background noise and said it to repeat until wakes up. Basically I wish the playlist were set up in the same way that single stories or single meditations are. I also wish that y’all would fix the bug that keeps glitching out and forcing the app to shut down whenever I try to play track sleep and listen to sleep meditation. Overall this app has been the only thing that got me to go to sleep.. I love how it will repeat the stories until I wake up.,I wish you had the same options…
5,2018-10-07 11:44:12,"This app is definitely great for sleeping. It really helps me relax and wind down, but it’s also great throughout my day! I love reading, but sometimes it’s hard for me to stay focused on my book if everything is silent around me. With this app I can play sounds so that that’s not a problem. The app even has some more sad music so I can get in the right mood. I have this same problem when doing homework and other things, so this app is a great help. I’m also so impressed with the amount of content you can get for free as soon as you enter the app. With a lot of other apps that read you bedtime stories or play you relaxing music there are very few options of what you can do if you don’t pay real money for it. I definitely recommend this app especially if your like me and need sounds playing in the background.",This app is so helpful!!
3,2022-03-01 00:26:48,I have been trying for over a week now to get refunded money that was taken out of my account without my permission. I purchased this app a year ago on February 18 at half price three Valentine’s Day special. I immediately canceled so that I would not get any future auto renewals or charges on my account. I have been chatting now via email… They seem to only be able to send one email a day…To get my money refunded. I’ve sent them my receipt and literally given them all of the information that I have available to me. And I keep getting told that I’ll have to go through Apple or dispute the charge through my bank account which in itself anyone knows is a mess. I have never received the receipt for the new charge anywhere just money taken out of my bank. And at this point they still can’t even cancel anything for a future. Company needs to keep better track of information!,Good App/ HORRIBLE BILLING PRACTICES
3,2019-12-29 04:01:03,"I’ve been a Relax Melodies fan since it was first released as a one-time payment app, away before year subscriptions, through today, but I guess now with Headspace competing for our cash now it’s going to cost 60 bucks a year to get the same content I’ve been paying 15 or 20 for years now. It’s a really greedy money grab and it is not giving me the relaxed vibe I signed up for all those years ago. If I would have been aware that this change was happening I would have cancelled my subscription when it was up for renewal in October. Now I’m stuck with very basic service that definitely is not worth it.  There is a terrific product here but I feel like I’ve gotten a big “F you” for being a loyal customer since the beginning. The “unlimited access” isn’t even an option on my subscription page, it only shows up when using the app, that I need to pay ANOTHER 60 bucks in addition to the 20 I already paid.  Not. Happy.",Whoa what happened
5,2018-01-09 21:11:31,"OMG. This app is by far the best app I’ve ever needed and didn’t know it. I’ve tried sounds before but they were single sounds that became so quickly repetitive and annoyed me to no end. This, however, gives you so many choices and combinations you don’t notice repetitions. Plus, you can choose sounds that conjure up reflective nostalgia, or makes you feel one with nature, or whatever experience you want to feel or relive in your mind. You get to choose what mixture of sounds from your own experiences give you rest, peace or a relaxing moment away from the hustle and bustle. I no longer need the fan I used for white noise to fall asleep by and have cut down on my use of melatonin. I love the meditations too. What a joy to listen to and slow my mind to relax. I just can’t say enough about this making me feel closer to heaven.",Closer to Heaven
5,2022-01-08 17:31:53,"Searched for an actual sound machine for awhile, always worried to make the plunge in purchasing one, incase I didn’t like what white noises/sounds it had.  Realized finally that there must be “an app for that”. Downloaded many different ones, always to find that I didn’t like the sounds they had to offer. Figured it was probably because everyone’s phone’s had different speakers and capabilities, so I kept searching.   Saw that this one was extremely customizable I played with a couple sounds that I liked and slept really well the first night. After a couple nights I decided to upgrade to a premium subscription and love it! Have made a couple different “mixes” so far.

5,2018-05-15 04:39:39,Relax melodies is so so very helpful because I used to have a very hard time going to sleep at night but then when I heard of this app I was so excited to try it out at first I thought that it would not help but after a few days I loved the app ever since ya I know that last thing was weird but very true because know I get to pick my own melodies and choose the different volumes as well so thank you to who ever made this app I would love to share this app to the whole world also without this app I would’ve had to go back to my therapist again because of my anger but with this app after school or during school it always helps me get right back on task and lowers down my anger and since then I have been doing so well with controlling my anger and it is all thanks to this app   From willow Douglas,Sleeping method/anger reliever at school and home
3,2021-04-12 21:41:32,"I’ve used this app for years. I noticed months ago there were new free sounds added and I used 2 to make some of my favorite mixes, then you just took them away. I literally listened to one to try and relax and an hour later it’s locked! Because you took away some of the free sounds. Now I can’t even edit these mixes after training myself to relax with these sounds, I am unable to access them to edit at all because they contain those two sounds.  The only reason I can think you would take away those free sounds is to force people to pay for the app... I’ve always been tempted to purchase because I find the free version of the app helpful, but now I’m frustrated because it feels like I’m being forced into it... now I don’t really want to.  At least allow people to edit mixes they’ve made previously, just remove the no-longer free sounds. 😖","Used for a long time, now frustrated"

In a newsletter I read from Data Drs. they reviewed this app with such glowing praise that I immediately downloaded the free version.  Ta da...I slept well!  After a few nights of sleeping well, I shared my results with a few other family members who also struggled with sleep, and...they slept fantastic too!  I had so much fun creating exactly the kind of melodies I preferred, that I bought the lifetime full version so I will never be without it.   I had a small technical issue and after emailing  customer support it was solved very quickly!  Thank you for your excellent customer service.

I have downloaded several other apps throughout the years for relaxing sounds, meditations, etc., but I keep coming back to this one. The reason this is my favorite one is because you can actually customize your sounds according to your needs. For example - I like this very specific rain sound that helps me fall asleep, I can customize to 3 types of rain - city rain, rain over a roof and heavy rain,  not only I can all three at once but I can make one louder than the other. It’s prefect! The meditation programs have helped me calm down and relax more times that I can count and you can also customize these to your needs.

I currently have my room set up with Twinkly (brand) lights on the ceiling and I play this app along with it. I have some cotton up there covering some of them (they don’t get hot, so no worries) and I edited the lights to look like lightning. I play the thunder, eternity, and birds sounds from this app with my “thunder lights” and it calms me from some of my more intense depression/anxiety/overwhelmed days. I sit in my room with near blackout curtains and float away. I feel like I’m sitting in a forest in England again. With the bushes of blackberries around me and the soft dark grey of the clouds above me. It brings me to good memories and relaxation.

5,2020-09-29 18:51:34,"I’ve discovered that both white noise and mindfulness meditation are very effective in helping me manage my ADHD symptoms - and this app is a one stop shop! Absolutely worth the premium subscription.   I love that you can fully customize your own mixes and then save them. Want to make it sound like you’re sitting on the front porch during a thunderstorm? You can do that! Want to make it sound like you’re on a beach at the Oregon Coast? You can do that too! The ability to tweak mixes to your liking results in much more believable soundscapes than any of the pre-made soundscapes I’ve come across.   The meditation and hypnosis options are super on point as well - and there are a lot! Also, I love the female narrators voice. Very soothing, no vocal fry or weird whistles or mouth noises which always drive me crazy.   Finally, I was having some complications due to the fact that I purchased my subscription through my email but primarily access it through the app, and the customer service was absolutely phenomenal in getting that all sorted. I do recommend that you just purchase your premium subscription through the app itself to avoid any issues - but rest assured that if you do have any issues at all you’re in excellent hands!!!","Best White Noise App, Best Customer Service"
5,2020-05-19 16:48:41,"This app has it all! The sleep sounds are amazing and I love that you can mix and match what sounds you want (I love mixing “rain” “night” and “campfire”). The sounds stay on all night and if you do a meditation, the sound continues to play even after the meditation is done (which is great because I rarely make it to the end of any sleep meditations, they knock me right out!). The meditations themselves are fantastic, the programs to ease your way into them is great, and I love the people voicing the meditations. This app is better than Calm and Insight Timer by a long shot!

But the new update doesn’t have a “time off” choice it just has a timer. So now I have to do a bunch of math every night to see how long I want the app on. Please add the time off feature back!!!!!!!  There are many relaxing high quality sounds to choose from.  I have used the various rain, night, frog and peeper sounds for many years to help myself fall asleep and stay asleep. The sounds can play continuously, uninterrupted all night.

If that’s not the definition of a rip off, I don’t know what is. Don’t believe it if you think you are buying the “lifetime” subscription. Lifetime is subject to however long the developers feel like it.  Update: I wish you had made the instructions more clear in the update for those of us who had subscribed previously.

I got a apple phone for the first time downloaded the app. They added stories, actual music not just what was one the yellow squares, and they had so many new mediations. I was amazed. In 2014, I made a choice to pay $20 for a lifetime subscription to BetterSleep and I have never regretted it! Now the cost is more. Which I will say it is well worth it. Get it now!!

The guided meditations have been invaluable, supporting me during anxious periods experienced over the last year during the COVID-19 pandemic.   I get excited when there is a new story or meditation which keeps my interest and experience with Relax Melodies fresh, never boring.

1,2022-09-04 10:54:58,"The developers have really stooped low. There have been many apps over the years by this company that are identical and the only purpose seemed to be to make you pay for the same product again. Now (4 years ago) they have abandoned the app that I and many others paid for, and are asking $10 a month for the exact same app.  Even the UI is the same. I’m sure it’s only a matter of time until the “old” app gets removed from the store due to incompatibility.   How greedy can you get? It’s a freaking soundboard with sounds that are/were likely pulled from elsewhere either illegally or royalty free and even if they are “original” $10 a month is insane for what this app offers.  Maybe it’s hard for the developer to understand since they’re likely filthy rich at this point and don’t remember what things you can buy for $10, but there are plenty of things you can buy for less that are worth more than some white noise.",Abandoning your paid app and asking for a subscription on this one

I am glad that I can browse others choices and tweak them to suit me. I’ll have my mix list varied and customized again soon enough.  The sounds available are easy to combine and control. My children both like this app, and we use it for sleeping and general background noise.

Over the 16 years I’ve been a mechanic and US Army Veteran, I’ve always had trouble sleeping, either in my own bed, or while traveling.. and I can honestly say, with no recourse, this APP, is phenomenal.   I personally like it, because you can tailor make your own “sleep soundtrack”, and have the functionality of it being actively engaged, and set on a timer to become silent while you are beginning of falling asleep. The concept of it fading out using a timer, is genius, it just slowly gets quieter, and then de activated the app after the timer expires. Thus saving battery life if your not plugged in charging your device.  I also like the APP, for its user interface, it’s well thought out, super simple, easy to use, and it seems the developer has taken great care to actually “listen”, to customers, as they have suggested various improvements over the lifetime of this apps existence, through updates.  IPNOS has done a good job, and I don’t usually hand out praise, so by any means, that should be held in HIGH REGARD.  Thanks for reading, B. Murray",A “real” honest review!

It helps me fall asleep so much better and easier each time I need to fall asleep -or fall back to sleep- during the night. So much better than tossing and turning and I enjoy it better than the other app I tried. The 7 min military hack for sleeping within 2 minutes, even helped me help my mom relax and take a nap during a recent ER visit -in 2 minutes! I didn’t play the 7 mins from app-just used the 2min method I learned by repeating those 4 steps out loud for my mom-she fell asleep and I relaxed…in an uncomfortable environment. Priceless!!",Addicting
5,2021-09-27 03:55:15,"This app has been so beneficial to myself and my family. After each one of my children were born, and my cuddles in the rocking chair and shushing weren’t enough, I logged onto my phone, threw it in the dock, and out came the white and brown noise with a vacuum cleaner. WORKED. EVERY. TIME. I got to take my little darling to her crumb and finally have time for myself. Now that everyone is older-including me, I still struggle with sleep and staying asleep. I once again came back to this app and the meditations, along with a sleep band, have proven to be some of the best sleep I have gotten in awhile. Thank you team for you experienced and extremely friendly work staff! I am more than happy with my experience and will continue to support the work you do!",Longtime Customer with no chance of leaving
5,2021-08-18 04:51:58,"Every now and then I will struggle falling asleep for a few nights. I think it’s times where my stress and anxiety are higher than usual. I will struggle falling asleep and then staying asleep and any little disturbance from my home or from the outside will wake me up and it’s absolutely annoying. I tried the app Calm and it was nice. It did help, but then I tried this app and seeing how I can pick different sounds to make a customized mix to fall asleep to is just brilliant!! I thought that was really cool. The wide range of sounds to combine and the ability to save the mixes is really convenient. I finally found something that is not only fun to use from combining sounds but also that just helps me have a good nights sleep which is relieving to say the least!",THE WAY THIS MAKES ME FALL ASLEEP SO FAST
5,2021-04-06 05:09:08,"I love this app. I used the free version for awhile and was so impressed that I purchased the full access version. I am very sensitive to noise and I get irrationally irritated by the sounds other people make as well the music they play out loud. Relax melodies is the oasis I can escape to to block out the irritants. There really is a sound for everyones preference. Recently I started using the meditations to help me get to sleep, I fall asleep almost immediate upon starting any one of the sessions. Equally useful are the “getting back to sleep” sessions for the times when I am awoken in the middle of the night, I am a light sleeper and any disturbance wakens me, which then I have a hard time falling back asleep because my mind won’t turn off. Well, problem solved with this app and its many sleep meditations. Love love love ❤️Relax Melodies. It’s worth every penny.",Best app ever!
5,2017-11-19 11:41:34,"This app is truly fantastic. It's free and you get a lot of options at no cost. There's standard relaxing sounds like waterfall and ocean waves. There's also some unusual sound effects that are equally relaxing and very cool (space odyssey and under water mermaid). You can layer the sounds on top of each other to create your own unique sound loop (I like layering windstorm, rain on the rooftop, and thunder claps) each sound effect has its own volume control so you can truly customize the sounds that are right for you. There's also free music and weekly meditation available. If you like to have a fan or white noise in the background, try this app! Theses even an oscillating fan and white noise sound effect! It's free and there's no risk. I love this app and sleep so well all night with relaxing Melodies playing in the background.",Relaxing Melodies App 5 stars
1,2019-11-13 07:36:08,"I don’t know what it takes to get real help from these folks. I’m having significant issues. I’ve followed all proper steps to reach out. They contact me, but terminate or close my request before the problem is solved. Things work for a day or two, maybe even a week, then trouble restarts. When I pull email to respond, I find they’ve terminated the request.    Last time they answered me about a billing problem (as if I needed that on top of performance issues), they recommended an apple link to get resolution. The link didn’t come close to being the right place to seek help.   I’ve used this app ever since it came onto the market, and I’ve watched over the years how problems have appeared with all the new bells and whistles they’ve added. Bring back the simple app that had multiple sound effects that you could easily layer with tunes if your own. Make a different product for all these add ons.   The current problem is that it won’t save my mixes, so every time I use it, I have to manually set up. The app often turns off when I layer in my own music. The latest app crashes fairly often. If I get a phone call, the app won’t restart after I hang up. These are things that were not problems in the past. I’m always fiddling with this app; it used to be no muss, no fuss.   I suppose it’s too much to ask that someone would actually bother to call and work out the bugs in a phone call.   These companies want our money. After the sale, they disappear.",Continued Trouble
5,2023-09-07 14:13:00,I have been having trouble falling back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night for a long time.  Been trying sleep pills like Melatonin and others. I just returned from Europe after a 12 hour flight and layovers. I was exhausted. Woke up after two or three hours for a bathroom break and could not fall back to sleep but still very tired. I was beside myself.  I remembered this app I had already downloaded some time ago. I activated the app and within ten minutes or so I fell fast asleep.  I woke up a couple more times in the night for bathroom breaks and fell right back to sleep afterwards listening to this beautiful music. I woke up this morning feeling rejuvenated. I am the happiest person in the world. I’ve been saved.  This is my new best friend.,Sleep issues.
5,2018-05-24 12:55:10,"I downloaded two meditation apps over the past few years. When I upgraded to a modern tablet, I intended to download one of the same again, but stumbled across this one: “Relax Melodies: Sleep Sounds.” What a happy accident! This app immediately surpasses the old ones in many ways, including the ease of navigating, the visual invitation to calm my mind and spirit, the selection of sounds and melodies, volume and timer control, and everything in between!!!! My favorite part is being able to build upon the mood I’m in, one element at a time. First I choose the “sound” (i.e. of nature). Then add in a melody, and layer that with a few other elements, and VIOLA! I have customized a smooth “mix,” and can save it for next time. This is the absolute best, most wonderfully relaxing, versatile, user simplistic, meditation app available. Simply SUPERB!",Unexpected Excellency!
5,2023-10-23 05:45:09,"A lot of the nights I need rain sounds so I always ask my parents to put in rain sounds every single night!❤️It’s calming! Helps me sleep! And when ever I need to focus it helps me so much!😍 And there isn’t only just rain sounds there’s multiple sounds you can choose from! For example you can choose white sounds wind,storm,thunder and more!And you don’t have to only pic one sound you can pic as many as you want mixed! So you can listen to rain sounds mixed with thunder and then add it to your playlist I guess and when ever you want help falling asleep or more just press play and you’ll have it saved in your profile!😍❤️ I would recommend this app if you need help getting your baby to sleep or even you,or need help focusing!❤️😍",I love this app so much!!!😍❤️
5,2023-03-31 14:13:23,"This is an awesome app. From all the sounds to the stories and meditations this is an app for a multitude of things. Sleep, an alarm, meditation just to name a few. Plus it can be used for people of all ages both infants to seniors. I've only use a few of the many sounds available but the selection is amazing. Even sounds you would never think of. What is awesome is you can raise and lower each sound individually and create your own mix. If your looking for a sleep app or an app to help you to just lay down and relax check it out. You won’t be disappointed. Plus It’s worth it to buy all the content as they are all beneficial. Check out the app if your looking for one or have one already, you might be impressed. Hands down one of my favorite apps.",Awesome App
5,2022-03-31 05:09:27,"Didn’t think it would work but it did. Turn off all my lights and got comfortable had the volume jsut high enough so it wasn’t a bother . And before I knew it , it was morning time. I think $60 a year is steep but due to being a super insomniac it’s really a great alternative for a good night sleep since all the sounds and options on the app are so well chosen. With all the selections on the app you’ll truly find something soothing enough to calm the nerves and slow down heart rate which translates to good sleep. It also has a sleep timer to calculate how much sleep one is getting every night . Would I recommend buying it yes. If $60 is too much take advantage of the trials but I never do reviews and I just felt required to update everyone on how useful the app can be.",Lit app
1,2023-10-11 01:15:17,"I’m getting really tired of Apps that claim free with an in app purchases that actually is just an advertisement for a paid service and does nothing without “subscribing”. Yea, you get a few days free but not until after you give them a lot of info and subscribe. The developer replied to say that they offer one of the biggest free libraries and asked me to change my review. So I gave another look. If they do have all this free content, it is well hidden. All the colored noises except white noise showed locked. All the “Try Something Else” showed locked. All the “Middle of the Night Walks” showed locked. Continued scrolling down through the content and EVERYTHING but White noise was locked. Oh. Found a FEW free add on noises to the white noise, but 99% of the rest were locked.  Sorry guys, if you have all this free content, you do a great job of hiding it. I stand by my review. The free is just an enticement ad to subscribe content.

5,2022-06-12 00:34:49,"Have been using this for a long time and have always loved the custom sounds. I use it in my Apple TV also and it’s been great. There are some improvements I would suggest as it is way too easy to delete things. There’s no way to lock a particular mix, so you never know when this might be the last time you get to hear your favorite mix. Sometimes I make duplicates when I really like something. But that gets confusing. Also, most recently I’ve been trying to use the sleep feature, which is really neat! But I find really annoying is that if I tap the sleep icon, there is no way to undo that. I have to continue and then wait to cancel the sleep. There needs to be a back button after you hit the sleep button.",Love the app
5,2018-10-17 04:39:51,"I downloaded the app a while ago to help with getting to sleep, but usually fell asleep with the Netflix on instead. I largely ignored and forgot about it, but recently gave it another try. Not only does it help to sleep without the tv, but it’s even better to use at work. It’s really noisy at work and I have a lot of anxiety. I used to listen to podcasts or classical music to drown out the work noise, but this has been much better. Experimenting with different sound combos is fun, and you can save your favorite combinations. I wish my stupid iPhone would allow it to work when I turn on night shift, but it’ll mute the app for no apparent reason. Another great feature is being able to set a timer so you don’t leave it on all night. Anyhoo, speaking of which, it’s time for bed. G’night!",Why did I ignore this?
5,2021-09-27 04:33:41,"I have been using this app for a few years now, and it’s by far the best sleep app out there. I love the customization capabilities as I can tune it just right for me and my daughter. Having the capabilities to adjust the volume of chosen loops and add layers is a brilliant format. And being able to create a playlist makes it easy to pull up your favorites and those that you notice work best. I often choose the nature and water sounds, but I find myself in love with added layers of white noise, airplane, spaceship, or just the good ‘ol fan!  Amazing app! I can see this library growing more over time.. hoping more forest song birds and jungle choirs get added. Ive been diggin the study/work vibes with chillhop.   Five stars easy. Definitely worth getting the lifetime subscription.",Brilliant app

I especially like the recent addition of a filter for Bedtime Stories, which enables you to search for a story by name of narrator, genre, length, and much more! There is also a similar filter for Meditations.  You an set bedtime goals, listen to any one of a huge selection of sounds, or create your own mix.  The choices of sounds, meditations, music, etc. continue to expand, and my favorite, the Bedtime Stories, can put me right to sleep.   Finally, the customer service is always exemplary - they are quick to respond and offer great support any time an issue arises - and they are all so nice!

Now, I have been able to sleep faster, I actually feel the difference ! I also really like their feature life coach, because it helps with stress, relationships and focusing better throughout the day. Sleep move program is also another cool feature that helps me cool down after having a rough and hectic day. This app truly works!! In fact, I have decided to purchase the lifetime access option, because it promotes what it states on their app and also promotes self care! What else can I ask for !? Good job !",Truly blessed !

It's simple to navigate I have the free one for over a month now and have not been annoyed w advertisements. They're there just not all up in your face. And they even incentivized the review. Rate us and will give you 2 more sounds. I liked it already, now I'm just taking the time to let you know and getting a bonus or two. Get this app. Nothing to lose, only glorious sleep to gain.

Thank you so much for your app and all the amazing things you’ve added to it! I also wanted to thank you for the update you guys just did! I can now go back to playing an audiobook from a different app and have your amazing sleep sounds on at the same time! I also enjoy your sleep stories at well. But I am a so happy about this new update because I was unable to play your app at the same time as other apps! Please don’t change this option on future updates.

Allows myself to calm everything and drift to sleep (most of the time.) I’ve actually recommended it to quite a few people which I never would have done with other sound apps.  I love the amount of sounds that you’re given and are able to create your personal mixes. There are a quite a few “locked” as well that you need to pay for, but having this app for quite some time I haven’t found a reason to purchase more.

I really love how you can adjust the volume for each individual noise. I only wish they had some songs that were longer or that there was a way you could have play one song after another and not so repetitive as I am often listening along with my baby either in the same room or through a baby monitor. Perhaps they do if you pay for the app but I am content enough with the free version. If they had some longer songs or a way to have them auto change after so long I’d give it five stars for sure.

Though I enjoyed it, I stopped using it for a while, but then I redownloaded it again just recently because I have been having trouble sleeping again, but now the sounds turn off in the middle of the night even without a timer or an alarm set to it. I’ve tried changing it, looking in my settings, and even looking it up online, but the audio will only stay on for about three hours and then it stops. I would really love this app again if I could change that and my sounds will stay on and not shut off in the middle of the night while I'm trying to sleep, but even if I try to extend the time that the audio plays, it won’t let me.

This app has so many sounds we could easily find one they like similar to our sound machine and it makes it so our kids sleep better when away from home. Now we use this app as our sound machine for our newborn and love it! Our newborn didn’t seem to sleep as well with the sounds on the noise machine we already had, but with the HUGE variety of sounds on this app we were able to find some that help her sleep.

You can easily click on something like river or waves or even city night sounds or a lullaby, and then build on that by clicking and unclicking various symbols to find the sound that works for you.

Basically you have dozens of sounds to choose from and can create your own mix of up to 12 layered upon one another and the volume of each component. I tried it last night with ocean, rain of roof, wind, and oscillating fan and seriously woke up twice thinking it was summer (January in MN) and felt incredibly relaxed (I'm actually under tremendous stress). I'm working on other mixes for other needs (focus, calm etc) too, but had my anxious girl download it and she was blown away.

There are so many possibilities in this app.  I especially love the hypnosis.   I have made many combinations of sounds for the background.  I recently started listening to a new story, I haven’t listened to the entire story yet as I fall asleep after a few minutes.  Last week I had a musical combination that went through the entire night and lulled me back to sleep when I awoke at 3am.  In the past I would awaken in the middle of the night and toss and turn until daylight.  This night I just took a deep breath, let it out and listened for a minute and I was back to sleep.

With other apps, I found the effects to be too artificial. I highly recommend this app to anyone who needs a little bit of white noise to get you to bed. I love the sleep timer option and you can layer multiple sounds to suit your needs!  My only negative comment and reason I knocked off a star is that I recently noticed there’s a startup sound when you open the app. It can be extremely loud and alarming. Not the best way to begin your journey into lalaland. If the creators could omit this startup sound, I would definitely give it full remarks! :)",Works wonderfully!

Thought the unnecessary graphics of dangling ""charms"" would be a distraction and that it wasn't a robust app (especially for being free), but I was mistaken. Lots of sounds, lots of music, and even a great section with meditation style tunes and voices. Excelleng compilation, and think I'll grab the Pro pack just to support a good app developer.

There is something for everyone! I especially like how I can balance the sounds to so one is not overpowering another sound. This is way better than those spa or meditation playlist because I control exactly what I want to hear and when I want to hear it. I become the composer of my own sleep time melodies.

None are jarring (as I found in some other apps). Full of features I love, especially the ability to create my own mix. Just choose from the huge menu of sound options, then I can layer those melodies/sounds, tweaking the volume of each until it is exactly what I desire. User friendly. Easy to do on the fly. I use the timer. It will either stop your melody, or you can have it close the app, saving battery. You can import music as well. Genius! I've used it at least a year now, rarely it glitches.

We also have a little one so when we travel I use this for his sound machine and hook up a little speaker if it needs extra volume (but generally the speaker on my phone is plenty). I’m also a music therapist and this app is phenomenal for creating relaxing soundscapes for clients and patients who need something for calming and relaxing. I love that you can layer sounds and that it doesn’t turn off when I go into another app (most sound apps shut down if I need to open another app to look at something). The only thing I would consider adding are visual backgrounds so that if I want to set this up with relaxing scenery to look at, it would be an option.",Versatile & Soothing
1,2018-07-02 05:46:10,"I've had this app for over a year now, along with Relax Meditation.  I recently went into on both my iPhone and iPad mini to find most of my mixes locked out because I did not have a 'Pro' subscription.  And yet I must have had access to those sounds in the past because I was able to create the mixes.  In an attempt to troubleshoot I went ahead and registered for their new account feature to see if maybe that would spur things and it promptly deleted all of my mixes.  This is on top of a previous bug in the Relax Meditation app where sounds had claimed to be no longer download and wouldn't download again.  A response to a support ticket was to delete and redownload the app, which would also destroy all my mixes.  And they don't offer the registration services on the Relax Meditation app, even though I obviously wouldn't try it because doing it in Melodies destroyed all my mixes.  They haven't even updated Relax Meditation in over a year.  So while both are decent apps in many ways I'd keep an eye out for the Ananda app to go on sale as I recently found it.  90% of the functionality of this app but Free, or even just $2.99 otherwise for lifetime vs what I now see Ipnos wants $99 for.  I originally paid $9.99 for lifetime access on Relax Meditation, which again has 90% of the functionality of this app.  Save your money.  Stick to the now limited free app and find other apps like Ananda or Insight Timer to suit your needs.","Shady, real shady"

Lol Only suggestion I would like to add is, being from Puerto Rico, I have suggested this app to many who love the app themselves who are from there as well, wish there were sounds from the island (crickets/grasshoppers, native island instruments such as the “Quattro” for melodies and especially the “Coqui” which is found only on PR and Hawaii). Hopefully, could possibly add in a future update!? Otherwise keep up the AWESOME work.  Thank You",Absolutely Perfect!!
5,2018-10-30 07:18:26,"I have a problem when trying to go to sleep that I can’t relax and I’m too focused on my surroundings. I feel the breeze from a fan, hear a drop from a sink, pipes, neighbors, etc. And listening to tv and other music doesn’t help because I focus on listening to keep up with what’s being said and I try to recognize patterns in sounds. With this app I can create the ultimate mix of zen for me by creating my own personal mix of relaxing sounds. I have sounds like a cat’s pur, rainfall, waves, birds, all blended at various volumes. Something about “white noise” and various ocean/rain playlist doesn’t work for me and I just listen and get annoyed by the music and stay awake 🤷🏽‍♀️ but Relax Melodies allowed me to finally find the peace that I was looking for to be able to relax. LOVE IT!",Really helped with sleeping!
5,2017-07-15 02:06:25,"I've used Relax Melodies for about three years now, especially when my anxiety is amped up. The sounds are soothing and many of them complement other sounds on the app, so you can layer them to great effect. I like that the app plays continuously without timing out, and there's no noticeable looping of the sounds; all this means you can find the sounds that suit you, set your volume, and have the soothing sounds transport you and your concerns elsewhere for as long as you like without the abrupt ""starting over"" gap you hear on noticeably looped sound apps. This app can help you find your zen and get into a better mood. It's always improving, it is stable, and there are often new additions (and your older favorites still remain too!). Thanks, Relax Melodies!",Relaxing and Soothing for Frayed Nerves
5,2021-12-08 16:15:25,"About 4 years ago I paid $20 for a lifetime subscription to all future updates. After a recent update to the app (and also having to reset my iPhone) that subscription was broken and I only had access to the basic (free) parts to this app. After multiple attempts I was unable to restore my purchase. I contacted customer service and, even though it was 4 years ago they honored my previous subscription, even though they stand to lose money by doing so. I am not a fan of the current subscription model, but I am happy that I don’t need to worry about that cost. There are so many sound options and there is sure to be something that will help you relax or sleep well.",Great app…excellent customer service
5,2021-08-27 05:10:36,"On my business trips I suffer from regular stress-induced insomnia. What a joy to find something that helps clear my mind and deliver me to sleep! It took a while to find a set of sounds and meditations that work for me, but it’s worth the exploration (even though it meant a few more sleepless nights while I found the right combo). I wish you could sort sounds based on intensity level instead of just by type, and that you could more easily modify a mix once it has started. I also wish you could slow down the voices of meditation/story readers (like you can on podcasts).  I love the narrators they’ve found, but slowing the voices would lead to more tranquil storytelling. Other than that I give it top ratings.","Finally, some rest!"
5,2018-06-11 03:01:22,"I have lots of sleep issues - I usually can fall asleep pretty quickly, but often (on average at least 3 times a week) would wake up around 3:30/4 am and be totally unable to fall back asleep bc of a racing mind. Listening to the melodies on this app has actually helped me fall asleep, and even though I set it to turn off after an hour, I am somehow sleeping better throughout the night. And, on the (far fewer than normal) occasions that I have woken up too early, I just turn this app on again and I've fallen back asleep. I will also add that I use an under-pillow speaker for this, which is great so then my husband doesn't have to hear it. I love love love that this app has been able to change my sleeping habits, no sleeping pills necessary!",Helps me fall asleep and STAY asleep
1,2020-03-07 04:26:14,It's hard to fall asleep and stay asleep. I used this every night in Afghanistan and it really helped. I’ve used it for a few years and have never had a bad experience...until now. I paid for the full version years ago. Loved the binural beats. I saw noticeable differences in my sleep so I knew it would be worth the investment to purchase the full app. I even recommended this app to a number of friends and family. Now they want to charge monthly for it which is fine but THEY TOOK EVERYTHING I ALREADY PAID FOR AWAY!!! I bought and paid for the beats and all the other sounds. Why would you take them away and make me pay for them again. If this doesn’t get fixed consider me no longer a consumer.  UPDATE: After a timely exchange with their support I was able to get my sounds and melodies back. This is a good business practice. Back to 5 stars.  UPDATE 2: and it’s all gone again. You would think that if you pay for something you would get all the product you pay for and at least get to keep it. Nope!!! I paid money to unlock everything years ago and they move to the subscription style and just like that everything I had is gone. If it would have locked me out of any future content then ok but to literally STEAL stuff from me and lock it behind their new paywall is absolutely atrocious.   I absolutely would not recommend the makers of this app to anyone. Extremely anti consumer.,They take it all away
4,2020-02-22 22:22:57,"Just letting you know, I’m not a bot. I love this app! I really like that you can create your own mixes with sounds of your choice and save the mix. I also like that you can use other people’s creative mixes too. But. I wish their were more free stories and sounds. When I download the app, I was exited about getting the stores along with sounds. But I only got one free story all the others were locked and needed a subscription. I really wanted to listen to the winter cabin story but it was locked and I was a little upset. So if you would like to get more users I would recommend that you unlock more ASMR sounds and more stories. Could you maybe unlock the winter cabin story? I would definitely listen to it! So more free ASMR sounds and more stories. Thank you for your time.",Love!!! But more free things needed
5,2018-03-08 07:35:15,"This app, is FANTASTIC! I used to have iDream and I was always bragging about how it was the best and there was no other app like it... But when I was scrolling through alarm clock apps I saw Relax Melodies. It seemed a little boring when I saw it but the ratings were 5 star so I thought, what the heck? And I LOVE it! There is an alarm and timer, you can add sounds together or alone. (My personal favorite is heavy rain, thunder and frogs all in one,) plus if you rate it you get two extra free soundtracks! (That part doesn't matter much though,) this app is entirely free with an in app purchase but I'm sure it's worth it! This app seriously will put you to sleep or calm you down in a noisy SUBWAY! I hope you'll love this app like I do! Thanks for reading this ridiculously long review! 😝👍❤️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",Please read this!!! 👇👇👇
5,2018-10-20 16:00:43,"I have (3) relaxation apps on my phone and this is the only one I listen to.  I’ve had to use it multiple times for serious situations.  We have two kids, both under the age of 7, and when they fall to sleep (in the same room) we have a floor fan that we turn on for ambient noise.  Every-single-time.  Whether for nap or go to “night-nights”.  So when the power goes out during storms, or we go on vacation or to somewhere else to sleep/nap, ambient noises are an absolute must.  Open this app, choose a few sounds, and all is well.  I’m thinking about opting for one of the upgrades, because you can never have enough different ambient noises to choose from!  Kudos to this person or team for creating this app.  It really is a sleeping lifesaver.",The Only One
5,2023-02-14 19:20:52,"I am very happy that the BetterSleep team has finally listened to the users and brought back the option to play audio in the background of other apps! I'm very glad it's back! I have been using this app for 10 years since it was a basic white noise sound mixer app and now they have grown and gotten more content on the app which I use every night before going to sleep. I love the SleepTales bedtime stories and the music that goes along with it, it helps me drift into a peaceful sleep. The sound mixer has my favorite sounds that I've been using for years, but they regularly add new sounds which I enjoy listening to during the day to help me concentrate. The best bedtime sleep aid app in existence!",The BetterSleep team is the best!
1,2018-05-21 20:28:35,"App is fine for free, DON’T PURCHASE LIFETIME OR PRO ACCESS. Pro/Lifetime access will disappear after every time you close the app. Now - they try EVERY time I open the app to make me purchase it AGAIN. They also took away access to sounds I have already purchased. They delete your saved sound mixes. Even if I “restore purchases”, it doesn’t restore my saved mixes and the access disappears when I close the app. Overall they clearly don’t care about their users and will screw you over if you pay. I have bad anxiety about falling asleep due to night terrors. I purchased “Lifetime Pro Access”. After the last update, my access disappeared and all my saved sound mixes (that really help my anxiety) are gone. They also took away sounds I ALREADY paid for (like Tibetan bowls), which were on my previously saved sound mixes - the only way to get them back was to leave this review. I’m so disappointed in this app and the makers of it.","Purchasing “lifetime pro access” is a scam, your favorites get erased after update"
4,2023-03-22 03:12:22,"I’ve been using this for years, since it was still RelaxMelodies, and I have a lifetime subscription. All of the features are fantastic, and I’ve easily gotten my money’s worth since I started using it. However, there are some features which I think need more work.  For example (and this is the biggest one): I wish that there was a way for me to use the sleep tracker feature while also listening to my playlists that I’ve created. I listen to the same playlist of stories every night, but when I try to use the sleep tracker, I only have access to a small number of story/ASMR options. It would be great if the sleep tracker was a bit more flexible. You also can’t use Bluetooth headphones in the sleep tracker, which is unfortunate too.",Love this app but…
5,2020-05-07 13:58:08,"All I can say is...thank goodness for this app. A few weeks ago I started to not be able to fall asleep every other day because of noise, stress, pms or anxiety. I've NEVER had trouble sleeping before. I had to keep taking a sedative before bed and it didn't kick in until a few hours later, and I'd wake up terribly groggy with only 4 hours of sleep.   I used it last night. 20 minutes of nature sounds completely numbed and relaxed me. Then maybe 10 minutes of white noise & rain sounds made me drift off and become sleepy before I took out my headphones. I didnt have to take a pill last night. Its almost like falling into a dream state. This app saved me another restless night and groggy dead tired morning! Yes 100% it does work.... thank you!!!!",It really works!!
2,2022-09-03 12:41:16,Used the free version for quite some time and was happy with it. I upgraded recently to have more sound options and sleep data. Since upgrading it has been very buggy and frustrating. The timer no longer works consistently. I like falling asleep to sounds but not waking up because of them. I am a very light sleeper in the early morning hours and when the music does not shut down after the 30 minutes that I set it too….it ends up being the very thing that wakes me up way before I want to get up! This has happened several times since upgrading. The sleep data does not reflect what is actually happening. One night it said I was awake for 5 hrs when in reality I slept soundly all night. Another night I was up several times but it did not reflect that at all. It no longer records any night time sounds. It was not worth paying for.,Disappointed and awake
4,2022-08-06 06:23:08,"It’s a great app. But I actually got it so my daughter could have it and it was shareable. The problem is it never shared with her, when we tried to purchase it, it told me I couldn’t because we already owed it on a shared account. But it never gave her any of the subscribed stuff. So I cancelled mine and paid again on hers….and when she swiped out of it just today…it wiped it out! She deleted the app and reloaded it….shows in her subscriptions, but still shows locked symbols for most of the stuff.   IMO if this app sharing worked without hassle, it would be great. On its own it’s great. But I’ve now paid for it twice in a month and the one who wanted it in the first place can’t actually use it the way she wants to. So if it’s just for you, it’s great. If it’s to share…beware.",Almost 5 stars
4,2023-08-10 10:10:42,"I’m tired of hearing the same meditations over and over again, and they’re not real good about adding new meditations. But it’s great you can create your own music, you can have the music continue playing after the meditation stops for a specified amount of time, you can create your own music with different noises, you can add noises to the music, I’m very happy with it otherwise. But they definitely need to continually add new meditations, PLEASE!!    Also, it sure would be nice to be able to control the volume after you click on “track my sleep”. If the volume is too loud after you push on track my sleep, you have no way of controlling it unless you stop the entire meditation and start completely all over again",Need MORE new meditations on a regular basis
5,2019-02-21 05:29:43,"I wanted to personally thank you for helping me fall asleep! When my body goes through stress, I can't fall asleep fast enough even though my mind is tired. I happen to find your app in search of a free app that would give me what I needed for little or no cost. The sleep meditation you provide for free has put me out the last two weeks, right away & the mix of nature sounds coupled with a soothing voice has finally granted me the sleep I've needed. I tell everyone about this app because it's the first app that has worked for me! Once my friends have tried it, they say it knocks them out!

5,2018-11-15 08:53:32,"So far I have adored this app! I love that there isn’t really a limit (that I have found) to how many songs one can have playing. I can create the perfect mix for my own needs. I have also used this to create atmosphere for writing or studying as well and it serves that purpose perfectly! The only complaint I have with the app is that there is no way to purchase individual sounds or packages from what I can see. I’d love to get just a couple extra selections without paying a monthly fee because I don’t want nearly enough sounds to justify it. Still there is a massive selection to choose from, even without the subscription and I’d 100% recommend this to anyone who needs noise for sleeping, studying, writing or drawing!",A fantastic way to sleep!
2,2018-12-30 04:49:08,"This app has a feature which lets you create a playlist of music from your phone to add into your meditation mix, which is genius - when it works. But it randomly grays out certain songs saying that they must be downloaded on your device to be playable, even though they do not show up as “available songs” to add to the playlist unless they are downloaded on your phone to begin with! It basically does not recognize certain songs as having been downloaded. Very frustrating.  I was using an older version in which I had paid for pro membership and saw that it was not updated for iOS 12. So I downloaded the new version and was forced to pay for the pro membership again in order to gain access to the music playlist feature, only to find it has the exact same issue.  Please fix this and I will leave a much happier rating for your otherwise beautiful app.",Buggy Music Integration
4,2018-10-17 05:15:08,"Everything I’ve listened to keeps me from falling asleep, but that’s me, not the app. It’s way better than the other apps I’ve used when I’ve spent the night places where I didn’t have a fan. My fan stopped working and payday isn’t until Friday, so here we are. They asked for a review, so this is what they get. The fan sound may sound like a fan, but every 20 seconds or so it drops in tone, almost like the sound of someone walking in front of the fan, which always wakes me up. That being said, having the fan option is worlds better than white noise. That just sounds like a black hole of nightmares pulling me into the snow of an 80’s television. The rest of the noises they loop are just distracting. I couldn’t imagine them bringing anyone relaxation, let alone sleep.",Just using until I get a new fan.
3,2018-07-09 21:51:08,"Just when I was r say to give it a 1star review as that in the latest update my previous ‘lifetime’ purchase was gone together with my previously created mixes designed to make my daughter sleep when traveling as we mimicked her nap and nighttime sounds she has at home.  Then I looked at other ratings presuming I wasn’t the only one and yes bingo. It was stated that through settings I could restore my previous purchase which worked but my former mixes are gone and the functionality is not 100% the same.  Regardless of above, the app itself is fabulous and we love the different sounds and that we can mix the volumes. It would’ve been nice to know it was hanged and not have to go through trying to calm a toddler while programming something that might resemble something that’s at home but at least now we can again when we’re home...",Former purchase restored- mixes gone
5,2018-06-07 06:28:12,"I love this app!! It helps me go right to sleep fast and no matter what I’m troubling to fall asleep for.

I really love the fact that you have so many options to choose from without having to pay for the pro version like most apps. You can create a number of different sounds and with many different options. When I am listening to the sounds, my phone is usually charging and because I love to have all apps closed so I can conserve battery when I’m charging, this app gets 2 thumbs up!

5,2018-05-19 09:30:53,I am very impressed with this app. It’s customizable with the free version and I plan on exploring the other parts of the app that require an upgrade. Many apps make you feel like you have to upgrade to get anything other than very little.  I had tried out another sleep app previously but the sounds and layout of the app weren’t that great and after 5 days free you had to upgrade to continue using it how you started out and most features were taken away so I lost interest. Glad I did because I found this one.  This one gives you a lot for free and then introduces you to additional beneficial features that aren’t required. I love the set up and the options. You can even enable it in the health app settings with your iPhone. :),Perfect
5,2023-07-21 02:29:12,"I love this app and always use it while I’m sleeping. I like that i can make and save my own mixes of sounds that I like. Although I don’t like that it asks me to buy premium constantly and I can’t listen to certain things because I don’t have premium. I also don’t like how it has 1-24 hours to play your sleeps sounds but you can’t go above three hours, it confuses me and I wonder what the point is in having the other 21 hours there if they can’t even be used. Other than those problems this app is really good and I would recommend getting it, most other apps you have to pay for to use at all so I’m happy I found an app where it isn’t mandatory to pay. Thank you Better Sleep!",Good app!
5,2022-11-12 19:07:36,Update: they updated the app and got it running within a couple days and all is good.  Next time I’ll be patient before ever marking this app less then five stars.  It’s an amazing app and I highly recommended to anyone!! Amazing developers who are on it and there for you!  I love this app and have been using it for years now. I want to give it 5 stars but after this last update my playlists were wiped clean and the app is unusable at the moment. It keeps crashing with any meditation I put on once I turn the screen off.

The meditation guides are amazing and super relaxing. As with the bedtime stories! Yes, bedtime stories. You may wonder why the heck would you listen to a bedtime story as an adult, but actually they’re really nice and they have all types of genres. I recommend this app completely.

There is a timer that you can set so it will stop. The woman’s voice is so soothing—she’s amazing. The ability to change the selection and/or combination of sounds extraordinary. You are also allowed to change the volume of each element added. Another thing is that when you use the 15 min sleep exercise it is over the sound selection so when it ends the music or sounds continue to lull you to uninterrupted relaxation or in my case deep sleep.

Relax Melodies excels on both fronts. There are many sounds available with the free version, and the volume of each can be controlled individually. Once you have everything just right, you can save your combination as a named track.

I have created separate playlists for different tones that help me when I’m studying or working on a writing project. It has made a huge difference in my ability to concentrate, think deeply about critical concepts, and productively work toward my academic goals.   I really appreciate how this app in particular allows way more options for customization, down to every small detail (like the comparative volumes of the separate pieces in a sound medley), when it comes to creating the perfect ambience; I’ve tried several other apps and none even come close to this one.

I began to play those while I was working.  I found stories and guided meditations… so many options!  I’ve used the sleep tracking function, too and now I have proof that my sleep is improving.

Every time I open the app again now it seems that new features are added that I can’t use due to their expensive premium price. And every time the app is updated my entire favorite selection is lost, which is very frustrating. As far as I can tell, not a single new sound has been added for non premium users for at least 8 years.

That being said, I think a fixed price of $60 per year is pretty rigid, especially since there were previously different subscription options. I don’t personally have that much of a problem with the price itself—after all, it’s only $5 per month—just the reasoning behind it.  It sort of feels like a money-grab. It would be great if there were an option to buy individual features, or at least a larger variety of subscriptions. A monthly payment option would be awesome, and I’d be MUCH more willing to buy the premium version if I were billed once a month. It would be a lot easier on my budget.  Despite my concerns, paying for the premium version isn’t off the table for me, because I’m really interested in the features I could potentially be using, and because this app has served me so well in the past. I’m glad there’s a 7-day trial period to base my final decision off of.  All in all, I’m confident that I’ll continue to use Relax Melodies in the future, premium or not.","Great, but recent changes are giving me mixed feelings"

Where do I start ? : You can create your own personalized melodies using the array of sound choices you are provided with (I personally go with the rain options they have) .  You can modify the volume each particular sound has exp : I have one of the melodies playing faintly in the background of a light thunderstorm and semi heavy rain .  You can even set notifications on the app so that you can have a fixed time to go to sleep ! Additionally you can set a timer for how long you want the sounds to be on and the app will close its self after the selected the period of time you’ve entered .   Onto a smaller thing that whilst I don’t like do not affect the function of the app or change my love for it  : a small selection of sounds can only be used when purchased , BUT to the app’s credit the amount of free sounds outweighs the sounds that can only be used when purchased by a large quantity.","EXCELLENT app , fulfills it’s purpose MAGNIFICENTLY"
4,2021-01-12 01:56:25,"Don’t let your eyes deceive you, it’s not an ordinary sleep app. It actually works. I’m an insomniac, everything about me is against sleep. Except when I don’t sleep, I’m tired all day.     My sister recommended this app. My first thought: “Meh. Let’s try it.”, so I did. I tried a meditation for my first night, wasn’t for me. Second night I tried sounds while I was already tired. I fell asleep quickly and slept all night. This is a miracle. The only thing is, a lot of the things I would sleep easier to are Plus, and I’m not able to buy Plus.    I have a suggestion for the app, if you could record your own sounds to sleep to. (e.g. for weirdos like me, recording the sound of your dryer.)     Overall, great app. Thanks for reading my long(?) review.                                      -ilovehappiness20",Amazing. Except...
5,2021-03-11 07:01:49,"The ability to make your own customizable sounds and music together?!?! So amazing! I love everything about this program, the sounds are so pleasant and perfect for whatever you’re doing! Studying? Meditating? Yoga? Sleeping? They’ve got everything for everyone.  They also have guided meditation sessions and story times for whatever you need. Need a break from reality? Need something to bring you back into your body? Need a calming exercise? Or even sessions to help you get better sleep (duh)!  The staff as well have been so helpful and kind! It’s been an absolute pleasure to work with them for any of my problems, they’re so  understanding and come to the table with an open mind and heart. Over all I would give 10 stars if I could!",AMAZING APP
1,2022-07-30 15:44:38,"No functionality to cancel paid subscription, which is inexcusable. I’d mistakenly assumed my subscription would be expiring after a year (because that’s what the app indicated in the settings, that it would be expiring this month), but it instead auto-renewed without any advance notification to me (I did not set up the subscription through Apple, which I now wish I had done!). Help & Support button does not work at all (even with Notifcations on as the app instructs), in order to contact Ipnos to delete my credit card information (which, again, I cannot manage or remove myself through the app or web interface). Deeply disappointed because what the app offers is great, but it’s not worth this headache.  Update: another year has passed since I’ve had my account deleted, yet the developer had the audacity to charge my card again for another year. Absolute garbage.","Great app, atrocious account management"
5,2019-05-07 12:10:12,Be advised developers. Individuals like myself were about to jump on a 1 Star review train after seeing the past subscription to the app was simply non existent. Spent 30 dollars to activate everything in the past and a new update forced us to purchase yet another more expensive subscription. We weren’t happy. But one review mentioned of a “renew subscription” hidden in the settings. Others other than myself may have given a 1 star rating for the same reason. It’s best to have the subscription auto update or at least alert past subs with an obvious “don’t worry! We value our former subscriptions! Press here! “ to avoid such a conflict.   Those are my two cents. The app is amazing. Great work otherwise.,Almost gave a 1 star review.
5,2021-02-07 19:57:37,"I downloaded this app several years ago and paid for the premium membership because I wanted a larger variety of sounds. Since then, they’ve added so many other amazing things that I use nightly to relax and sleep! I also use it when I feel anxiety coming on, the guided breathing is so helpful. I could sit here and just list every part of this app and how much I love it but this review would be way too long. There are a ton of popular meditation apps out there but nothing as robust as this one, it caters to all the different relaxation techniques and it’s so well designed. I will always have this app on my phone!! ALSO, I must say, this app has NEVER been glitchy so that’s a huge thing!","Long time user, one of my top apps!"
4,2023-03-16 06:53:04,"The sounds are so amazing! I love just doing white noise for a relaxing background as I drift off and I can keep it on all night. Another thing that is amazing is I can go to a reading app I have, and still have this app on in the background. The one annoying thing is that a lot of sounds are locked and the way to unlock them is so expensive. I have two suggestions:  1. Make a way to preview the sounds so I can make a betterly educated choice on whether or not to buy the subscription. 2. Make a way to buy individual sounds for like, 5-15 dollars.  I have seen other reviews with the same suggestions, so I really hope you’ll consider developing something like this.",So good except for one thing!  I love this app! Pls read this developer!
4,2021-05-16 05:15:50,"**Update** Since Relax melodies has updated their app so much to include guided meditations, stories, sleep moves etc. I can understand the need to go up on price. I’ve found this app to be helpful on many occasions and it is very good, but it is still very very expensive IMO. I still have access to my very basic relax melodies app that I paid for several years ago and while it does not include the various updates, it’s basic and good enough.  Paid 9.99 for a lifetime subscription a while ago, went to use the app when I needed it and my paid features are gone and I’m expected to pay over 100. I went to “restore my purchase”... lies. This is really sad. Think twice before purchasing anything from them.",What kind of mess is this...
5,2018-08-31 03:02:26,"I have had this for about a month and it has worked like a charm for falling asleep and as background while sleeping. I didn't think it would work as well as it has. Also it has been very helpful for just unwinding after a stressful day at work.  This is an update. I've been using Relax Melodies for about six months now. I really love it especially when I'm stressed out with work. I'm still truly amazed at just how effective listening to the sounds can be to lower my stress, help me fall asleep and stay asleep.  My next experiment is to try the Relax Melodies to help me focus when I have a project to complete. I often find myself distracted by extraneous sounds,etc. I will post how that works for me.",Great for falling and staying asleep
3,2020-08-05 16:59:44,"its an amazing app really, and I listen to it almost every night it has so many possibilities and functions you can use it for but you have to buy a lot of stuff. I would love to listen to stories but only four are free. I’ve listen to them already. I did the seven day trial and it was great but I probably won’t use this app as much because i’ve done all the stories and meditations that are free. I would buy the year subscription, but I am very broke and I cannot afford it. I would love if you could make a couple more stories and meditations free for all people because some people don’t have enough money to pay, and they just want a good sleep like me. Anyways, other than that I love this app the sounds are pretty realistic and help me sleep. (I’d love to get a devoliper response.)",AMAZING APP BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY EVERYTHING
5,2023-04-06 04:35:16,"If you just want to relax, this app is awesome to listen to a calming voice telling a story. If you’re not in a mood for a story listen to soothing music, or listen to the music as you fall asleep, as I do every night. Add your own sounds to the music from the large assortment (I love the nature sounds, right now I am playing singing birds softly in the background with my music). Start the sleep timer when you get in bed, and the alarm will wake you when your time is up, and give you a report on your sleep, along with a list of sounds it picked up while you were asleep.  All in all, I would recommend this app to anyone who has sleep issues, as well as anxiety!",Great sleep app!
4,2018-07-08 09:06:16,"I think I ended up with all the sounds, but still not happy about how it all played out. I did increase my rating stars due to the fact that I use this app every single night - can't go to Sleep without thunder and rain...⛈  I think I just got ripped off. I paid 9.99 for a ""lifetime"" package that seemed to include all the closed sounds, as well as some extras. After my purchase was complete through the App Store, I clicked on one of the previously closed sounds and up popped a notice asking if I would like to download the ""premium"" package. I thought it would take me back to the App Store so that I could look at the cost, but it immediately loaded. I can't figure out if that was still part of the lifetime package or if I just got charged who knows how much... A bit irritated here!",Updated...
4,2023-09-24 14:28:38,"I really enjoy the option for just sounds and having the ability to mix certain sounds  (making one louder than another, etc). But I love the guided meditation for sleep, the River one is my favorite. I gave 4 stars because I can’t figure out how to make the meditations or certain premixed sounds last throughout the night (longer than the stated 30 min) and I wake up often in the night wondering why the sound stopped.   I’m also unsure of the sleep tracker. I have a boyfriend so does it pick up his snoring? How does it know what sound is from me- especially if I’m not wearing my watch so it can track my heartbeat.   Overall I like it but those are a couple things I would love to see changed.",Relaxing and Helps Me Get To Sleep
3,2023-09-03 13:28:33,"In desperation to sleep, I spent the $60ish dollars for a year subscription for this app. It truly has helped me when I am lying awake unable to fall back to sleep. I have not even used all the features, just the white noise/sound maker feature. Working the majority of the time, it’s worth it’s weight in gold. My HUGE problem with it is that at a $60 price tag, I don’t expect to have pop ups when I turn on the app. Such as, I accessed the app and a pop question of do I want to leave a survey comes up. I’ve had other such messages pop up which is very inconvenient in the middle of the night when you are trying to avoid being more awake and don’t have glasses on. Stop asking me anything!! Just let me use my expensive app in peace!","Love the app, hate the questions that randomly appear"
5,2021-06-08 15:42:31,I’m an anxious insomniac with ADD.  My mind races at night making to do lists or simply analyzing despite my best efforts otherwise.  I pair this app with a Bluetooth enabled sleep mask.  There’s some stories I don’t know the ending to despite listening to frequently.  The narrators have a tranquility to their voice.  I appreciate the ability to control the voice volume and the background music independently of each other.  There’s simply not enough I can say about this app.  Always coming out with new stories and varying sounds.  I also use the focus at work when I’m having a hard time watching boring tutorials.  Just get it if these problems ring true for you!,Worth the money?

This one sets the record to the all time high for best quality and customization for how you want to meditate. This is my number #1 pick. The different sounds and mixes make for an amazing experience. I really appreciate the time that was put in to making this app, it truly shows. I used this hoping to get better sleep and I got exactly what I wanted. They also have sound waves and different vibrations for anxiety relief and healing. IT ACTUALLY WORKS. Thank you to the creators. I’m happy to say I will continuously use this app. The price per year is also very reasonable for what you are getting. Totally worth it. Again, thank you.",I am blown away
5,2018-09-30 09:44:59,"A well composed piece of software that is able to effectively deliver what it is intended to do.  The application itself comes with a suite of free sounds that you’re able to mix and match.  There are paid sounds, however I never felt like I was missing out by using the free version.  The sounds are well composed and eloquent across the board.  If you have any issues finding peace at night to rest I would strongly suggest giving this application a try, as someone who never writes reviews and a young male with a horrible sleep schedule this application is fantastic, and its services stretch beyond its soothing sounds, but I urge you to explore its varying features for yourself.  Don’t miss out on the chance to get the sleep you desire.",Sleeping Sensation
5,2018-08-24 06:53:08,"It would be nice if you could chose a setting so every time you used it you could chose the timer instead of manually setting it. It’s not a problem but sometimes I forget which is a slight annoying but here’s my review!  I literally use this EVERY NIGHT. I have the worst problems going to sleep this app helps me get to sleep in less than 30 mins.  I have the timer set for that duration and NEVER notice it shut off. Without this I EASILY would be up 3 hours so for this 5 stars!   The meditations are great! I didn’t think they would work at first and after the 3rd night I fell asleep within 15 mins, my husband said. It’s super easy to use just make sure you set a timer so it turns off.",Love but one recommendation

I’ll set the sleep tracker and use one of the options displayed and at first everything is fine, but then the same track will loop over itself creating this echo of whatever story I’m tryin for listen to.

5,2022-12-29 08:55:18,"Of all of the sound options I definitely love the green noise best, it calms me immediately. There are also pink, brown and white noises that are all my favorites, too. Sounds like air conditioner and space ship are relaxing for me and they have a great variety to listen to. I’m not a fan of the music or sound effects, which are great if you like them and they have a large selection as well. I don’t have any problem falling asleep unless there’s something playing like a movie that gets my attention, so having these are great to listen to any time to relax. I will, every time day or night, fall asleep and be out cold before I know it! So it really does work!",Green noise is my favorite!

Having access to the sleep stories, mediations and hypnosis tracks has been a great help in slowing down my busy mind and allowing me to drift to sleep at night.  For me, it is helpful to distract all of those mental monkeys with soothing sounds and calming breaths, etc.    Unlike listening to an audio book at bedtime, like I used to, there is no anxiety over missing parts of the story or losing your place.  I find I feel more rested the next morning when I use the app to assist my sleep routine. Grateful to have this app!",Very helpful!
5,2018-12-02 12:04:06,I can't live with out this app. I used to sleep with a fan on and come winter I didn't want to run the fan and started searching for sound apps. This one is by far the best one on the market!!!!! It has the best selection of sounds and being able to mix match and blend my own custom setting ( waterfall white noise and oscillating fan) is simply amazing!!!  Even my toddler has her own settings (humming and immersed) that she can't sleep without!! We literally have this app on all of our devices!! I have over sensitive ears and this makes it so I can sleep comfortably and still be able to hear my kids and house hold noises at a lower level.  Thank you for making this app. I'd truly be lost without it!!i love it,Must have app!!!!
1,2021-04-29 18:53:21,"This was my favorite sleep app. I even paid for the upgrade and have been using it for years. However, the recent update has ruined this app. I appreciate the stories aspect and that you are trying to compete with the bigger apps but there are so many bugs now. The timers don’t work properly and the sound just cut off in the middle of the night so many times that I’m constantly waking up. I also used to be able to play these sounds with other apps, (asmr and hypnosis apps) that feature is gone now as well. Further more once you click on a story you can come out of that story and edit your timers without cutting the music and the story off completely and ending the ambient sound. I would have never paid for this disorganized app. Please bring back some of the old features and update with bug fixes so we can operate this app like the one previous.",Update has ruined this app.

I’ve been terribly sleep deprived for over a month because no matter how hard I try, I don’t fall asleep until four in the morning. In no way am I guaranteeing that it will do the same for you, all I know is I have my life back. I’m sleeping way better! Another thing this app has helped me with is inspiration for works of art and writing. Have you ever read The Little Prince?

The first night I used the app I did have a bit of trouble, only because there are so many options to choose from. There are in app purchases for different sounds, but I found the perfect sound for me without the other sounds. I definitely recommend this app if you are having trouble sleeping, because you have a large variety of options. You can pick up to three noises at the same time and it’s so relaxing. It fits my individual needs and instantly gets me to sleep. Overall, I really love this app and I highly advise you guys getting it. 👍🏻👍🏻",Actually great!

I’m a pretty greedy person and i always use “Vinyl Crackle and Joy” but i would love to hear what these ‘ice cubes’ or ‘bedsheets’ or ‘makeup brush’ sounds like 😂 I think that they should add a thing where you can pay for a certain section (ASMR, Brainwave, Sci-Fi, etc.) and not just all of them. I would totally buy the ASMR section because i love Vinyl Crackel 🥰 Also, they should add- (going along with the section payment) a way where you can test the sounds to see if you like them before you pay for it.

You can customize sounds, set a sleep timer or an alarm, and create your favorite combinations. ^^ They wrote the above but it’s true. I’m getting two free sounds out of this review.

How to use the sounds:  tap on it to play, tap off to turn off- will not shut off if you play another sound - that is the combination part.

I love how customizable this app is. You can create so many different combinations of sounds. Or even control the individual volumes of each to have one louder or softer compared to the others. The only thing I’m confused about is the pro version which has either a monthly subscription fee for $X amount depending on how many months you sign up for or an outright buy but for $100. Like, if I buy but change phones can I keep my lifetime subscription or do I lose that with a new phone? Otherwise I love the app. Keep up the awesomeness.",Best sleep sounds ever

I have always enjoyed my quiet time but the constant high pitched ringing in my ears was making my life difficult and depressing. Sleeping at night was impossible unless I took medication, which is something that I didn’t want to become dependent upon.  This app has helped me tremendously!  You can layer the sounds with whatever is most calming/enjoyable for you. At night, there are different wave sounds for relaxation and sleep that you can add to your layers.

Now the meditation will repeat over itself, sometimes 3 layers of voices coming through at the same time. Lately I have been going to sleep without the meditation, but now the app crashes constantly throughout the night, causing me to wake up.

One hope I would have is something more “power nap” oriented. All stories pretty much start with sleeping in a nice warm bed where as I’m sleeping in my car during my naps lol. Literally not a big deal at all. I always smile to myself as I tilt my driver side seat back when the story says relax and prepare for a goodnight sleep.

I downloaded this app from an IG ad and didn’t have any expectations, but I was so excited to see so many sounds ranging from natural to binary beats.

5,2020-04-07 02:41:43,"This app is great. I was having panic attacks and severe anxiety, and was desperately looking for something to help with the insomnia I was experiencing. I downloaded this app with the premium trial, and forgot to cancel it😬, so I was charged for the year. Well, I couldn’t go back, so I decided to take full advantage of my purchase and I have loved it since! This app is a great addition to my toolbox of therapy, medication, meditation, etc. I LOVE the Egyptian Sleep Temple hypnosis and Yoga Nidra series. The voice of the woman is calm and peaceful, and I love that I can choose my own background music and noises to accompany these meditations. I really have not used it during the day for the “focus” music, but I will in the future. It has proved to be a great accidental purchase.",I love this app
2,2022-07-07 02:16:35,"I really loved this app when I first got it! Unfortunately if you don’t pay to be a member, you really don’t have access to a lot of the stories. If you want to use it simply for mixing sounds at night like water and white noise, the free version will work just fine. In my opinion, the subscription is way overpriced.  The worst part about this app and the reason I am shopping for a different sleep app now, is because it is super glitchy. When you are listening to the stories, it will literally skip like a scratched CD from the early 2000’s. The sound mixer malfunctions a lot, and the function that automatically fades the sounds in and out does not work properly. There’s a lot of bugs and glitches that need to be updated in this app, but they’ve been happening for a long time and not been fixed.",Glitchy - Music Skips
5,2023-07-21 07:36:14,"I have been using this app for years now. Before I had the premium subscription and it was fantastic. Unfortunately I’m not making a lot of money right now so I can’t afford premium, but even the free version is worth it. You can choose from so many different sounds and small musical snippets to fall asleep to. They also have a lot to offer with the meditations, breathing exercises (which I love), and even bedtime stories! If you’re having trouble sleeping at night or can’t fall asleep to silence or even white noise, I would recommend this app so much. I use it every single night and I plan to continue using it forever!!",Highly highly recommend!!
5,2021-11-30 04:41:36,"I bought this app prior to the rebranding. I have the “lifetime” subscription, but I guess that doesn’t matter. Anything I try to do requires a subscription now? A shame and a sham. It’s too bad really because I bought the app, enjoyed the app and have used it for years before the rebrand.  Edit: after speaking with support it appears that somehow I was logged out of my account and didn’t realize it because it still showed lifetime subscription.   The app, while the account part was confusing, works flawlessly and the sounds and options available allow for nearly limitless ways to find your better sleep",Now requires subscription
5,2023-11-10 06:24:17,"I think that better sleep is a very good thing if you need help sleeping better it has all kind of things. Also, it lets you make your own kind of meditation and it focuses you more on sleeping. I think it is good for you to meditate when you get tired and start getting grumpy to. It can help you calm down and relax you more than you were before. Also if you feel like you’re being mean to some people and to yourself it can help you calm your body down. You just have to listen to the music let it flow in your body and you’ll probably become this is a very good app. I use it every night and I love it.",Review of how good better sleep is
5,2023-07-26 13:39:56,"Awesome app! Spent a week at my daughter’s and it was just too quiet. I downloaded this app and slept terrific! I actually slept better than at home, and didn’t even rise to make trips to the bathroom... so I shared the app with my insomniac daughter and she too has discovered the best sleep she’s had in a while! The app has so many choices and they’re not just for sleep. Some can be used for meditation or for calming moments. I personally love the different rains and storms. Whether I’m in a hotel with city noises or visiting my daughter with the stillness of the country or even camping, this app will help you and your loved ones get the rest needed for a positive day.",Wish I’d discovered this years ago
5,2022-01-10 03:08:40,"I have been having stress, anxiety, and sleep issues for a while now. I also suffer from chronic fatigue from other underlying issues. This app has given me all the tools I need to adjust my mental state, center myself in moments of frantic anxiety and impulsivity. Combined with mindfulness exercises and a low 5mg dose of melatonin I feel better than I have in a long time. I’m getting sleep, I can control my emotions better, and I even have less bouts of fatigue. My back pain has even begun to improve because I can relax enough to release the tension or at least ease the pain on particularly bad days. You will not regret this app and it is well worth the annual fee!",Life. Changing.
2,2023-01-17 07:48:43,"I’m baffled here. I love that this app provides such an array of sounds and even allows you to build custom sound combinations. The way it works is great. The problem for me is that most of the sounds are so “tinny” and grating. Out of a huge list of sounds, I only found two that I can use at all, and those two are not worth a dollar, let alone the $60 required for a subscription.  Most of the sounds don’t actually sound much at all like their labels. Thunder sounds like someone shaking tin foil, for example. The oscillating fan…well, I don’t even know what the sound effect is but nothing at all like an actual fan.   I’m glad so many people seem to enjoy this app but I do recommend trying it as much as possible during the free trial to make sure you hear what you’re paying for first.",Maybe my ears are just too sensitive?
5,2020-06-12 18:15:53,"The app is great! During this pandemic we must find ways to relax our body, mind and soul to ensure we keep our immune system up. This app allows you to do just that - relaxing the, body, mind and soul, at night.  I do have one recommendation for the Dev team to please add a functionality that will cause the app to automatically turn off after in about 2-3 hours to prevent my phone from going dead. This function can also prevent from disturbing the person’s sleep.  One night I turned over, from being in such a deep sleep - I forgot the app was on - as I was turning over my heart drop and I went into a frighten mode. My mind immediately thought the water was running/flooding my room - within about a 10 seconds, I looked over towards my phone and seen the melodies were playing. At that time, I was thrown off from my sleep and I couldn’t go back to sleep right away. Please, fix the “Sort by” options on the Review screen. I was trying to sort by “Most recent”, but the tool is not operating as expected. Other than that, I rate this app 5 stars!😃  Thanks! Leslie",Minor adjustment
5,2020-05-15 03:23:00,"This app absolutely helped my grandma and I start getting full nights of great and revitalizing sleep! We had fallen into bad sleeping habits and decided to try out some sound therapy to see if that would be ease our bodies into relaxing, letting go of stress & tension, and just feeling ready to sleep at a healthy bedtime. The results are so obvious and have really improved our moods, our actions, and our overall days! I love that there are nightly medication classes available besides bedtime stories and melodies. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to break out of unhealthy sleeping habits maybe caused by everything going on, or just anyone who wants to really max out on the enormous benefits of good sleep.",Incredible!!
5,2018-04-29 09:10:58,"building your own combinations, not to mention the ability to include brain frequencies to help in the back or foreground to facilitate a certain purpose, has changed my life in the first four days. you can save your creations or save ones other people have taken time to design. additionally there are meditations you may add for many purposes including dreams, concentration, being in the moment—this app is wonderful and i’ve only begun to explore it—it aids not only with sleep but with moments during each day when we might need some assistance in calming, settling, or centering. i also cant speak enough about the timer which allows the app to completely shut down after a specified time; i can positively say it’s done more than its job so far because i’ve not been awake for it to stop playing my chosen sounds, yet, and—on top of that—i've experienced solid sleep for some eight hours afterwards each time without even being aware until i’ve woken. kudos to the developers. a positive gift they’ve created and made available to the rest of us. thank you. -mandy",most amazing app for sound yet.
5,2023-09-04 09:01:27,"Better Sleep is the best sleep sound mixer, sleepytime storyteller, relaxation app, and sleep analyzer. I looked for something like this for years especially when my children were infants and then when I struggled to sleep due to racing thoughts. I found this and have never slept better due to my own customized sounds that play. I can even use the sound mixer during the day for relaxing. I love a good rainstorm for sleeping and nature sounds for waking. Also, the sleep analyzer helped me learn about my sleep patterns. If you’re into sleep stories or meditation, the app offers this as well. Give it a try like I have for better, restful sleep!",Better Sleep induces serious zzz’s
5,2022-12-09 06:00:03,"I had had this app since its previous incarnation, I used it for background noise to sleep to when there was too much noise outside. I was somewhat stressed when it changed so dramatically, but I used my favorite background sounds for a while. One night, on a whim, I decided to try listening to stories. I have the easiest time falling asleep now, than I have in a long time. We tell our children stories to help them fall asleep, so why wouldn’t we enjoy stories, as well? The stories have been wonderful! I particularly love some of the series, like Starship 28, and the Underwater City. Please bring more installments of those! Thanks for this app!",Better Sleep!
4,2023-06-26 02:23:58,"Got this app yesterday- really like the overall UI and the information it provides about one’s sleep. The vast library of music and sound effects and the ability to overlay them together to your liking is an enjoyable feature to get a specific type of sound to help you rest the best.  My only question, being the title of this review, where is the monthly subscription option? I’ve been incessantly asked to buy the premium version for $60 (an annual purchase). I read in bettersleep’s Terms of Service that it provides a subscription on a weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Am I missing something?  Otherwise, no complaints. Great structure and a myriad of useful features!",Monthly Subscription Option?
5,2022-04-24 12:02:09,I am still trying this out and I wasn’t sure if this could help me. I have a stressful work life and the last couple years have been hard-like so many other people. Watching the news and paying higher prices for everything adds to the stress and anxiety. I never relax enough to fall asleep fast and sleep through the night. But last night I used one of the meditations and I don’t remember very much about it because I fell asleep AND stayed asleep. I actually opened my eyes before the alarm. It was wonderful. I actually felt great when I got up! I am really excited to try this again! Sleep well everyone!!!,Slept through the night!
5,2018-05-27 01:01:07,"I love how many sound options you get with this app. They make your white noise customizable. What's even better is you can adjust the volume as you add each element, exit the app, and they continue to play. Fantastic!  UPDATE: I found a new use for this app. I know it's supposed to be used to help you fall asleep, but I now use it at work. When I'm in the office, I find it irritating hearing all the chatter, the keyboard clicking, and the xerox going when I'm trying to puzzle something out or relax and make production. One day I decided to pop my earbuds in and try listening to this app while I worked. I think I processed double that day while the beach waves crashed in the background. 👍",Great product
1,2019-07-14 16:36:15,"I’ve used this app for years and had at one time recommended it to friends and family that were having issues falling asleep and staying asleep due to background noises. Well, I’ll have to download another app to help me out as this is at least the 4th night in a row where for no reason at all the app crashes, causing me to wake up due to either dead silence or being able to hear noisy neighbors that this app once concealed. I’ve updated my iOS and the app itself believing that was the cause of the app crashing. But here I am, only four hours of sleep and the app having crashed twice already. Not that happy that I’m almost dependent on this app now to stay asleep but it’s very frustrating to keep waking up to restart the app, I feel just as awful as if I hadn’t had any sleep at all. Looks like I’ll have to look for another app to use as this continues to also crash on a tablet as well!",Consistently Crashes

This app has taught me so much about my sleep patterns and it makes me actually want to stick to a sleep schedule! It is so interesting to see a breakdown of your sleep throughout the night, and it makes me stick to a routine and feel very calm before bed. It has a bunch of ways to help you sleep but I find the bedtime stories to be my favorite. It would be so cool to see them animated. It will also record your sounds throughout the night and calculate the quality of sleep you got. It helps to see your progress!",One of the Best!!!
3,2023-11-08 16:25:54,"I really like certain sound options but the fact that I can’t make them louder is driving me nuts. I’m used to sleeping with white noise from a sleep app that allows me to adjust the volume in the app separate from the volume on my phone; even if my phone’s volume is on max I can increase the volume in the app if I need it louder. I need to be able to do that with the green and brown sleep sounds. I live in NYC and I need to be able to hear the app over the sounds of the city. Also, my husband occasionally snores so it would be nice to be able to sleep through that. The meditation sounds are good but I can’t say I’m able to do much of that, though I’m trying to. If there’s a way to make the sounds louder than a low hum please let me know.",Volume issue for me

I have had it crash multiple times, and it won’t play the stories I downloaded. For me this is something I find disappointing as that is the function I use most. The app has a large selection of songs as well, but no matter what device you are on you can’t search through the songs. Instead you can scroll through the suggested music, while songs such as sound baths, and the background music to stories can not be listened to individually","Good on phones not so good on tablets, limited song access"
5,2023-10-04 13:35:13,For the past month I have not been getting sleep. And that made me feel so tired in the morning. I finally had enough and downloaded this app. Yes there’s not many sounds to have if you don’t have the plus but I’ve been falling asleep really quickly and I’m not waking up in the middle of the night. it tells you how much you slept and tries to keep you want to sleep goal  that you get to choose. are used to not wake up to alarms so I had doubts on this alarm because it is so quiet but I tried it and every day I have been waking up to it and feeling super good in the morning.

I thought this could work, so I was like... sure let’s try meditation! One thing though... How can I meditate when I have to BUY EVERYTHING????? This app used to be my favorite, I would log on and see all these meditations and sounds that I could just - ya know - use. Some special sounds were “Pro” but I didn’t mind. I went to sleep every night with my free  ten-minute-meditations. I miss that. Next thing I know, the app updates and all I can listen to is nature sounds and music. Might as well go outside and try to sleep with headphones. I get that the Pro feature should cost money and all that, but why is everything pro now??? I just want my favorite anxiety-relief app back. I’m more anxious having to buy stuff than I would be without the app at all. Sorry.🥺🥺😢😥",I don’t wanna do this...
4,2018-10-23 04:16:29,I only need 2 sounds and that is it. I would pay for that. Problem is is that I already did a couple years back for a lifetime purchase. Then I got a new phone. No more sounds. I’d pay 99 cents for a sound or two for the life of this phone or phone number or this number through one carrier.  Anyway I don’t like the pop ups and what not.  I already paid for it a while back so I don’t mind swiping and using this app for free.  Like I said. Paid for it already.  TnT said it should be simpler to just select your sounds and not worry about the others.  Been using the same melody/sound for years now.  Only gonna give it 4 because of the already paid situation. Probably not apps fault but then again not mine either.,Pretty good.
4,2018-04-27 06:31:59,"I’ve had this app for 5.5 years! Since my daughter was born. We used it to drown out the outside noise of our apartment and our neighbors. We use it when we go to new places that are a little too quiet. And we use it now every morning to help sleep through the rather loud birds that have taken up residence nearby. That being said lately we have had issues with it randomly just closing and turning off. I sometimes take naps when my daughter is at school and have to drown out the birds and within 5 mins of putting the app on it turns off and I can do that a couple times and it’ll just keep doing it, it just did it now and I closed it and reopened it and checked all the settings.

However, I discovered this app, put on a sleeptale about a pegasus or fairy wardrobe or a mermaid for her, and she is out in under five minutes! Every. Single. Time! I could not do that if I was reading her a bedtime story, making her lie there in the dark, nothing I did would ever get her to go to sleep like this app has. If you have children that fight bedtime, try this app out! Plus, if not for this app, her doctor would’ve never known that she needed to have a tonsillectomy. So it has helped us in more ways than 1.  Thank You Better Sleep! 💙🌝",Simply a miracle!
5,2022-04-30 04:44:07,I’ve used this app for years and I really like the nature sounds. I could do without the meditation and story time stuff but that’s just my personal opinion.   The thing Id like to see is more sounds that provide a serious / eerie mood. Imagine the inside of a spaceship and you’re not quite sure if it’s safe. Or maybe you are sad and you just want to wallow in it.  The current options for music / ambient melody are all so fluffy and sweet. Not everyone wants to float on a cloud of cotton candy all the time. Sometimes I’d like to go to sleep with a soundtrack to fuel my scary and adventurous dreams.   Think about it. I know you can do it!   Thanks,Great app - but missing something
5,2022-03-05 06:01:28,"I’ve used this app for over a year now and look forward to the new music and stories. I really like listening to the stories, but I often read in bed, so on those nights I just put on the music with some of my favorite sounds. Other nights I just want to crash and listen to a story. I usually use the timer, so if it does take me awhile to fall asleep the music or story continues and I don’t have to worry about restarting the app. I’ve just sent a trail to my oldest daughter, so that my granddaughter can listen. She sometimes has trouble getting settled and falling asleep. She’s ten. Keep up the good work you’re doing with this app!",I love this app.

My favorite program includes a purring cat, and I play this when I’m doing paperwork (I’m a psychotherapist, and there’s lots of documentation). I definitely work more efficiently. Who knows? Maybe it’ll even help me get my taxes done more easily. I also use it with my child clients, and they really enjoy it and benefit from it, also.  The buggy part of the latest update is that it will sometimes automatically play a random program on top of an individual sound that I select.

The soundscape creator is a great idea, the tones are genuinely helpful night-to-night, the music is good, the narrators do fantastic work (pay them more!) on all of their reads for any genre. The art style is lovely and flows together while being categorically distinct yet still flowing together (pay them more!).   Seriously, it’s a game changer. I got headband headphones to sleep on my side. Between those and a sound bath, a custom mix, or a little narrated story about some dude in candy town, I am right off to sleep.

Most of them put me to sleep (like 98% of them put me to sleep) but overall this app is the greatest of all time i love love love this app but it does have one flaw. I wish this app had more free options for the sleeping sounds and stories because this app puts me to sleep in about 15-30 minutes but that may not seem long because before i didn’t download this app, it would take me 45 minutes to an hour for me just to go to sleep.

I also like how you can set a timer for the sounds. There is many stories you can listen to. Something I don’t like is that some sounds and stories cost money. I think that is kinda stupid because it is just a app that helps you focus/sleep. If someone doesn’t wanna pay for this apps stories like me, it kind of defeats the purpose of the app. :( Thats all the cons i have about the app. So yeah I would definitely recommend this app it is pretty good.

5,2021-02-23 04:29:55,I honestly used to be that friend that would say that I got two hours of sleep. Most of my friends would tell me that I just needed to put my phone away at night. Little did they know that I did do that and that the only reason I wasn’t getting sleep was because my ADHD caused my brain to be all over the place. This app has helped my brain to focus on something so that I can fall asleep easier and now I’m the friend who actually says that I got to sleep at 8:30 and when people ask how I just tell them about this app. I only wish that there was more availability to people who can’t pay for an account.,I can sleep now
5,2021-02-05 17:10:34,I have had a hard time getting my baby to take naps pretty much since he got out of the “newborn’ stage where they sleep all the time anyway. I was at my wits end because he would be up allllllll day and only take one short nap at like 5 pm and then get back up and go to sleep at midnight.  He got a little better once I started sleep training but it wasn’t consistent. This app here SAVED ME. I start with the infinity sound and use the compose feature to add the sounds that I know he likes and he’s OUT LIKE A LIGHT. He never fights nap time anymore. I’m so much more relaxed because I get a good break during the day and in turn the baby is more relaxed. Hands down the best app I’ve ever subscribed to.,A lifesaver!

This is truly a five star app. I have a sleeping issue were I need to take medicine to fall asleep and it really helps. This might sound weird but if it’s quiet when I sleep I here footsteps and breathing so it really helps clear the dead silence. If you are like me a truly recommend this app. I heard of a similar app before called Calm most of it’s not free, it’s weird where they have story’s when you sleep, and unlike this app you can’t combine sounds.

5,2018-08-09 07:38:04,"I am a VERY sensitive sleeper and have a hard time finding sounds that are soothing and not irritating. I love the fact that you can layer different sounds and choose their individual volume levels! I highly recommend listening to all the different sounds they have to offer. Some that I wasn't necessarily immediately drawn to based on the name I ended up actually loving. I change it up too depending on what noises in my environment I'm trying to block out (or at least cope with easier). I'm currently loving a combo of Wind in Trees, Lapping Water, a little bit of Peepers and just a hint of Frogs. If it's a noisier night sometimes I'll throw in some Storm or Underwater too. It's fun to play around. Def recommend :)",Love
5,2023-08-01 11:42:22,"I purchased the lifetime version of this app 6 years ago, and have used it nearly everyday. The sleep sounds helped my child sleep when they were a baby, now we use the sleep tales to calm down at night. The guided meditations and visualizations are soothing and have helped my mental state and ability to sleep tremendously. My only wish is that there were more morning meditations. That seems to be the only part of the app that hasn’t grown with me. I still use them, but a little variety would be nice. Waking up can be my hardest transition of the day and the meditations really help me start off in a better mood. Thank you!",Worth it
5,2022-02-12 01:21:09,"I have horrible sleeping problems where it normally takes me an hour or 2 to fall asleep. I used this app a lot up until about a year ago, but downloaded it again so it would help me take a nap after being up for 30 hours straight because I was unable to sleep. I HATE naps because I wake up feeling anxious or annoyed. I used one of the ""brainwaves"" sounds and woke up an hour later on my own completely refreshed! I might be a nap person now!!!

But this app, with the guided meditations and calming stories just make me so relaxed that I fall asleep so quickly! My favorite one is the Complete Release Body Scan, which is only 17 minutes long, and I fall asleep before it’s over!  My only suggestion to make it better, would be allowing us to see stories and meditations by specific narrators. In “Starship 28” the narrator calls herself Ara I believe, and it’s the same voice for the Complete Release Body Scan. Her voice is by far the most relaxing to me so being able to find her content would be great!!",Works for my insomnia!
1,2020-03-05 13:15:27,"Updated review: Is there anything worse than disrupted sleep?! Especially when it happens multiple times nightly?! For an app whose purpose is to help relax and sleep, this one has been failing for the last several months. It turns off for no reason. Just this morning, from 4-5am this morning, it wouldn’t stay on for more than 20 minutes at a time. And within the last 20 minutes (now 6:08am)) I’ve had to turn it back on 4 times!!!!  If I knew the premium worked, I would purchase it. But there’s NO WAY I would spend money on something in which the free version is running so poorly. The last update of just 2 days ago is causing more probs than solving anything. Seems every update is getting worse! I’ve had this app for 10 years and, alas, it looks like I may have to end my love affair with them. It was a good run! I told everyone about you. My friends. My family. They all fell for you, too. But it looks like we are done.   Previous review when we were in our honeymoon stage: This has been a LIFESAVER to this lifelong insomniac traveler! Hotel noises, new cities, strange scents- all of these lend to no sleep whenever I'm away from home. I had the BEST sleep in a hotel, in a noisy metropolis! I have told LOADS of peeps about this app. Even the gent at the social security office yesterday:)",My love affair is OVER!
5,2019-01-09 05:12:17,It is a nice thing to fall asleep to when you are stressed or tired. I use relax melodies every day and i wake up with more energy and i am more awake for the day to come. If you gave insomnia i think this app will help you get to sleep better and faster for longer periods of time. You can mix and match for your needs and buy premium for even more sounds. I don’t have any upgrades and i fall right to sleep. You can also listen to meditations that teach you to breath properly and to find the right position when you are sleeping. Relax melodies is a good way to cleanse all of the stress and problems for the next day. I think other people will be pleased with relax melodies.,Lilyh0612
5,2018-02-18 21:39:51,"I was at lunch talking about how tired I still felt from not getting much sleep with the insomniacs I live with and how I searched the pandora app for sleep music, which didn’t help much due to hearing lyrics. Well, my coworker mentioned how she loves using this app to help her sleep when her hubby snores. I told her, “I’ll try anything!!” I started selecting sounds that were very relaxing and soothing to my mind, adjusted the volume to each sound, set the timer and voila!! I couldn’t believe how fast I fell asleep and to wake up and not remember any dreams. It was Amazingggg!! I love this app and have been setting it before sleep every night! Thank you.. for helping me tune out everything beyond my walls!",Simply Amazinggggg!!
5,2022-08-12 04:10:16,"I’ve been using this app since about 2013 or so and it has always been great! I loved the App to the fullest but as you know during that time iOS wasn’t transferring apps if you got a new phone and I never really remembered to put it on there! Just recently started using this App again and I must say the additions they made has really shocked me! Hard work pays off and I’m glad they kept working and didn’t get complacent! I suffer from sleep paralysis as well and it never happened on a night where I had this playing, that’s for sure! I use it for meditation or if I need a mental escape as well! 10 out of 10 recommend!",Superb App!
5,2022-02-09 03:03:15,This is such a good app because this is able to help me sleep so well and I bet it will help you to. Here’s why. First off they have meditation music and talking and the best part is is that you can make you own song by mixing sounds together. For mine I have dreamy music enterity music thunder and rain I think and I fall asleep in at least 5 minutes. THIS APP IS SO AMAZING! There is one thing though that I would change about this app and that is that a lot of the meditation talks are locked and you need premium to get it witch some people can’t get. I think there is only like 1 or 2 of them that are unlocked. But over all I love the app!❤️❤️,THE BEST ❤️❤️✨✨
5,2020-05-08 02:52:43,"I love this app, but I don’t love how you have to pay a million dollars for the locked Idoms. If there was lower prices on things, I would love this game even more. and when you buy stuf for life, that you could actually afford them! But the game gives you great sounds to use straight from the beginning, and I use them all quite a bit. I hope that in the future I can buy stuf, (when I’m a billionaire), and play all the sounds that I really want. My conclusion is that I like this game, but I would like a lot more if I could afford the stuff. But, it is a great game and I 💙this app a lot!😉me shall be happy with app FOREVER!!!!! I mean...","I L-O-V-E this app!!!! But, there are issues."
5,2018-05-18 09:03:51,"This app has been a complete game changer for me! I’ve struggled falling, and staying, asleep my entire life. I tried it all -natural and medicinal remedies- but nothing helped (at least not long term). I downloaded the free version of Relax Melodies and it may have been 2 weeks before I committed to the full version. I love the customizable sounds, but the meditations truly sold me! I listen to one every night when I hope in bed and, to this day, I’m rarely able to make it through a full meditation before falling asleep. They truly are relaxing and incredibly helpful! This app fueled my motivation to incorporate mindfulness and meditation into my daily life (beyond strictly sleep assistance). I highly recommend!!",Love!
4,2018-11-05 02:57:38,"I love this app, and it helps me to sleep every night! I just don’t exactly understand Pro. I understand that they need to make money and profit from this somehow, but still, it seems like it takes up too many sounds, but not enough good ones... I’m not getting pro, simply because I don’t need and don’t want to spend money. But, it has a lot of sounds that you won’t that much, and the free sounds are fine. This is obviously not a bad thing, and I like it, but there is also the problem of that it simply is too exclusive. There are too many sounds that are exclusive to Pro, so there are a bunch of sounds that you don’t need, and not enough that are free. But whatever, I’m fine with anything, so okay.","Pretty Good, But Why Pro?"
3,2018-09-11 04:06:29,"I want to start off by saying I use this app every single night, I can’t sleep without it!! I love how relaxing and solid the sounds are, they can really cover up all volumes of noise. I’ve recommended this app to many friends who travel and are in/out of hotels and can’t sleep because of the different noises night after night, and have been told this app changed their lives!   A few months ago I noticed a small change that is actually a big deal (to me). When my phone alarm goes off (not the alarm in this app), it turns the noise off too which I can’t stand. I’m an avid snooze button pusher so now when my alarm goes off, the noise turns off and I have to turn it back on. It never used to do this, please change this back!!!","Highly Recommend, but needs a fix..."
5,2017-09-16 15:44:49,"I had this app for about a month, before I decided to use it. I eventually used it off and on over a two or three week period, then once I found the right combination of sounds, I noticed that I seemed to really relate to it in a very mind massaging kinda way. Then I started using it more and more frequently. Now I use this app all the time, it's kinda my electronic version of some relaxing form of yoga. I find my self much more at peace and relaxed, I function much much better and it seems that my memory recall is noticeably quicker and sharper with more recall details. Maybe it's me, but since I been listening to this app I feel soooo much better. Thanks",Very soothing and relaxing
5,2023-09-22 02:56:47,"Ok, so I’m young and have trouble getting to sleep 🥱I was searching around for better sleep apps before I got BetterSleep, the ones I had didn’t help much and I saw BetterSleep with high ratings💯 so I tried it out and I didn’t regret it. l LOVE❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ this app! I love the creativity in the stories and meditations. and they are specifically made for sleep 💤  other apps just made story’s that would entertain me instead of them being relaxing and calm,  And they help me get to sleep but I have one suggestion it is not negative I just want to ask to add new stories and meditations more often. Thanks!                                                         P.S add more sounds.",Love it!!!!!
5,2023-07-21 13:58:09,"I’ve had this app now for a couple of years, and it’s probably one of the most-used apps on my phone. It’s literally saved me countless nights! So many meditations and great stories to choose from, read by dozens of voices so you can choose who fits you best. But for me, it’s the diversity of ambient sounds to zone out to that really sets this app apart. I love the fact that you can layer them one on top of the other. Also, you can individually control the volume of each one. So indispensable on those sleepless nights! I always keep my phone and earbuds within reach at night, and this app is the reason why.",I love this app! So relaxing...
5,2022-10-18 03:01:29,"Been using this app pretty much since my seven year old was born. Every single night since that first one in the hospital with him, as the best sound machine that has helped our whole family fall asleep for years. I have my traded to favorite mix.   Was up for an hour in the middle of the night when it was having the crashing problems because I couldn’t get to sleep it was too quiet lol. tried downloading a few others and none of them even came close.  Thankfully, the new update has fixed it and it will open again! Sweet music to my ears to have my comforting mix ready to go again.",Fixed!!
3,2022-11-17 16:59:40,"I have been using this app for YEARS. I purchased the lifetime access twice over the years (account issues). I used it almost exclusively at night during sleep. And I loved how I could turn the WiFi off on my phone, keep it in Airplane mode, and the app would play sounds while I slept.   Unfortunately, this capability stopped working a few months back. I have tried numerous times since to get it to work again, including deleting the app completely and reinstalling. But sadly, the app crashes a few seconds after turning off the phone’s screen. Every single time. This means I have had to use a totally different app every night now.   I miss Relax Melodies before it changed names and added way too many bells and whistles. I miss being able to simply listen to a sounds mix all night without the phone’s WiFi and screen being on.   If this is simply a glitch on my end, please offer Support. But if this functionality has been removed, please consider bringing it back. Many of us wish to keep our phones nearby while we sleep but do not want the WiFi signals. 🙏🏽",App Used To Work When WiFi Was Off (Bedtime)
5,2021-04-22 15:45:57,"Thank you for adding filters! So happy that I can filter meditations and stories by category and author!   This app is easily 5 stars. I’ve been using this for 4 years now and it’s been so helpful with getting to sleep faster and chilling out before meetings. During the pandemic I tried a few of other apps (like Calm) but they’re just ok gimmicky with the celebrity voices. Plus the other apps have limited customizable functions. With this app you can customize the soundscapes and volumes. And now with filtering, this makes this app even better. Would be really cool if left/right panning for soundscapes could be added!",Best Meditation & Relaxation App
5,2018-12-08 06:31:30,"This app is absolutely outstanding. They give so many sounds to combine and create your own relaxing music/sounds that will help you. I love how it has a timer and you can set it for however long you need and it gives you the option to stop sounds or exit app when timer is done. There is so much freedom on this app you can make it your own. This app really helps me to relax and relieve my stress. There are special breathing techniques they give you to try for certain things like stress. It also helps me to fall asleep faster. I definitely recommend this app. I am not exaggerating, this app actually will help you the way you need. Love this app❤️🌊🌬",You need this app
5,2018-06-24 19:28:56,"I always sleep with a fan or I used to always sleep with a fan. Now I use my Relax Melodies App. There are so many amazing choices. I was traveling for a few days and forgot to bring my fan. The local dollar store was closed. My daughter had told me about this app so I downloaded it and now it’s all I use. No problem forgetting the fan, plus I don’t have to pack the bulky thing. I usually find myself using a combination of a couple melodies. My personal favorite is the river and the storm. I do use several different combos so I don’t get stuck on or tired of the same ones. I highly recommend this app. To anyone that uses a fan, radio, or any other white noise to assist their sleep.",“WOW”
5,2018-06-01 02:35:54,"For many years I struggled with my sleep pattern. I tried drinking tea, wearing a eye mask, doing some light yoga before bed and nothing worked. I was starting to stress and look older than I really was. However, once I discovered Relax Melodies all that changed for the better. I was finally able to achieve better sleep thanks to their large variety of sounds and sleep meditations that guide you into deep sleep. Also they have a section for Life Coaching to help relieve and stress that may be going on in your everyday life. I don’t know what I would have done without Relax Melodies. They saved me from a very dark path. Thank you to the Relax Melodies team and keep up the good work.😘👍🏾",Just what I needed
5,2018-03-11 05:51:51,"I’ve had sound machine apps before so I wasn’t expecting anything special. But wow was I genuinely blown away by this app. With all the available tones, sound effects, and background noises I can make my music or melodies (or whatever you wanna call it) fit my mood every time. I hate how with other sound machine apps it’s basically “Choose between our predetermined rain sound, wave sound, or cricket/bird sound!” With this app I could have all three sounds going together if I wanted or simply a quiet background of zen music and distant city noises. I choose my mood music and that’s what makes this great. I rarely rate apps, but this one deserves the praise.",Love the customization available!
3,2022-12-18 03:06:00,"It’s impossible to scroll through to see past weeks or even a few days back. If, and that’s a big if, the top bar displaying past days even loads, it’s never on the correct week, and I cannot scroll to get to the right week. For example, my journal is currently displaying data from Dec 17. I had to reload the app three times to even get the bar showing the other days of the week to pop up, and when it does, it shows the week of Dec 4th to Dec 10th. If this isn’t fixed pretty soon, I’ll probably delete the app and ask for a refund of my premium subscription. There are other apps I could give my money to that do the same thing. Hopefully with more useful interfaces.","Decent sounds, janky interface"
2,2022-01-09 01:13:19,"Been using this app for a decade now. One of the latest updates is really driving me up the wall. Where I used to be able to just boot up the app and get to my stories every night, I now boot it up and need to rate the last thing, give it a feeling, exit the recommendations (which don’t include my usuals), click on the moon, then on stories, then scroll to find the story I want. PLEASE put me out of my misery.  On another note, there needs to be an option in-app to un-download sounds. A few times now I’ve deleted a story or meditation (accidentally, to save space, because I didn’t like the story, on a phone restore…) and it then will not play on the app at all, nor will it redownload. The only solution I’ve found is to delete the app altogether, then download it again.","So many new, unnecessary clicks!"
5,2021-01-18 15:20:16,"UPDATE EDIT: they reached out to me and helped me restore my purchase so I have premium access. Thanks for your help!   —I really appreciated the setup for their premium app - it really helps me with meditation and I paid for their app as a flat fee so I’d have it.   Found out they stopped supporting it and moved to upgrading this original free app in favor of a subscription services instead.  Surprise, surprise, they stopped supporting the old app and it no longer works at all.  I get wanting to make money, but you should at least have a way of “grandfathering” in people who paid good money for the original app or offering a refund. Very disappointed.",Ditched their old premium app for this cash grab
5,2018-07-15 00:26:05,"Really love this app. I never pay for upgrades but I bought the premium on this one for the haptic sounds and I do think it really helps. It’s simple and user friendly but has a lot of options. Tons of sounds, brain wave noises, sleep timer, clock option, etc etc. One of my most used apps.  Update: I paid to upgrade this app about two months ago and they upgraded it and my subscription was taken away. Developer contacted me and told me to go to profile:settings and hit restore subscription. This worked and it’s all back to normal. Thanks to the developers for being on top of it and fixing the issue.",Better than my expensive Brookstone machine!
1,2019-01-22 03:03:40,"I was happy to use that app many times last year when I had trouble sleeping. Today I wanted to use it again, and to my surprise all my favorite sounds and mixes I had made were unavailable unless I paid $50 a year for the full version (only $30 the first year though, thanks) or $200 for a lifetime? I never asked for the meditations, and the most basic plan that doesn’t include them is $36 a year - more than the 1st year of Pro. That change into a subscription model is a rip off. Apple has invited developers to use it and now that’s what we get with almost every decent app. The previous offering of the app should have been the free basic offer, and the additional features could have been subscription based. To be given something for free then seeing it taken back without warning unless you pay for it is extremely disappointing to say the least.",Subscription?
4,2018-10-09 15:29:37,"Update: I have found that it loses the ability to keep my pro features available if I put my phone in airplane mode. After turning off airplane mode, I then have to resync. This is disappointing, but not a deal breaker.  Great app, great selection of sounds, great timer feature. I am glad I bought it a few years ago during a promo, as their subscription is quite a bit pricier now. (I had an issue with a recent update causing me to temporarily lose access to premium features but came to the app store to see if anyone else had had the same problem and found the solution - in profile/settings, tap the button to restore subscription. This resolved my issue.)",I use this almost every night
5,2018-06-03 07:15:32,"I’ve always had issues falling asleep due to my anxiety. I have tried various apps such as this one, but none were as affective or as long lasting as this one. The biggest difference in this one compared to the other ones I’ve used is that it’s much more hands on. You can adjust every sound and the volume of each individual sounds. This helps especially if you have anxiety because it allows your mind to focus on something else before bed. I’ve used this one for 2 years now and the results have been amazing. This app I have recommended to so many people and they too love it. I can’t say enough good things about this app.",Best for anxiety
5,2018-05-13 15:09:10,"Exactly what I needed! We recently had our third baby and he sleeps in our room for now. The big kids both have a sound machine in their rooms but we needed one for the babes. Problem is, they no longer make the ones we have for the big kids. And eventually he will be in with his big brother, so I wanted him to be used to the same sounds. This app is perfect! I love that I can customize what sounds I want playing and the volume of each component. More so, I love that I am able to use other features on my phone while the app is still playing (which a different one I tried would shut off when you went to use something else).",Perfect!
5,2022-12-08 07:07:51,"Despite the in app purchases, there are plenty of free options with this app. You can create your own peaceful sleep sounds without having to buy anything. That’s what I like most is that if you can, or want to, you can buy more options but if you don’t, your not going to be left with nothing. I use this app almost daily and there have been times I forget to turn it on and wake up in the middle of the night - turn it on and can usually fall right back to sleep. I struggle to fall asleep and definitely to stay asleep and these peaceful, self chosen sounds are a huge help to get some rest!",Peaceful

If you see this please consider getting this app. I just have one problem... a lot of the things are locked... and you have to pay 60 dollars to unlock them, it would be nice if we could use them without having to pay... on the other hand... this app is truly amazing!",Peaceful!

2,2021-05-29 01:14:08,"Not much free (less than 10% of the available material) and you are constantly presented with choices that are premium content. These are marked with a very tiny lock symbol that is largely hidden in the design or obscured by subtitle color difference. So if you inadvertently choose a premium option, you’re immediately presented with the upgrade screen. This is extremely annoying and of questionably integrity in an application that is supposed to support relaxation. Free sounds are on a very short loop which is immediately noticeable and annoying. So far underwhelmed and glad I have not paid for this. Perhaps $50 annual premium content is awesome, but nothing here convinces me. Hate free trials as they are designed to make it easy for you to forget to cancel. Going shopping elsewhere.",Very hard sell to upgrade
5,2021-09-16 03:41:08,"I really do like this app, but (I have been writing very reviews on this, I always mess up so this is a short one) one thing it costs a lot to get the stories and other stuff can you maybe make it a bit shorter the price, I mean I get it is a lot, but I don’t think that much. Maybe you can do it for 43 that might be a bit better but not by much, but still can you just do that maybe. Otherwise it is a really good app, I like that you can share your mixes to the world that is my favorite, also I think helps me sleep, I have made a lot of mixes that I like all because of this app, so thanks! :)",One thing

I have to go back each time my alarm goes off and press play which is highly annoying.

The new update got rid of most the free sounds and now every single one of my mixes is unusable without a subscription. These are MY mixes which I've been using for about a month and I spent forever making sure they were all perfect. Now it is almost 1 am and it just feels like all of my progress with sleep has gone down the drain. At this point the app seems like just one big money grab that does not care about its own users.

4,2021-05-08 14:44:24,"Love the noises and the app in general, however, it’s frustrating that you can’t simply make/add a new mix without having to influence the current one that is playing. I’ll have a composer mix playing, but then I’ll want to create a new one from a blank slate and you can’t. I found out (after months of frustration) you have to save the current mix that’s playing, then clear it before being able to start a new one from scratch...This isn’t logical or convenient for the user.

The amount given to you up front is rewarding enough to warrant a download, and what’s pay restricted doesn’t make me feel like I’m missing out too much, though I would subscribe to it were it cheaper or done as a monthly payment.

5,2017-11-17 02:52:06,"I love this app! I’m happy I downloaded when I was looking for soft sounds to go to sleep with. I like being lulled to sleep.  I wake up so much more serene. I feel like starting my day rather than ughhh I have to get up and go to work. My thoughts go to things I want to do and helps eliminate stress by waking up and thinking of what all needs to be done once I get to work. These beautiful sounds are helping me put me first. I have started working on that balance in my life. This app is helping me do just that.  I love ocean waves always! I have to say wind chimes are lovely to fall asleep to. Zen is also a wonderful sleep aid. Other sounds I’ve tried are butterflies, seaside and flute",Music to sleep with
5,2022-11-18 00:13:21,I have had this app for a few years now and it’s been amazing! I love how I have control over what sounds to put together and even the volume of each sound that are playing together. They are always adding new sounds and new features. I have found the bedtime stories to be really helpful as they give me something pleasant to focus on till I fall asleep. Some music or sound effects I play while reading or studying or any time I want to relax. I’m at a loss for words to express how much I appreciate this app and the work that goes into it except for Great Job and Keep Up the Good Work!,I love this app
5,2021-12-25 06:20:34,"So I have this quite expensive old machine I got with my wife in the 90's that has the same mix and match sounds that you can blend to get your ideal sounds. But this app has the flexibility to change the volume on each, has the timer and alarm features and programming to start at various times. So it's a better gradual wake alarm too. Free version is great and the extras with the purchase are nice extras. I've tried three other apps and this one is the best so far. Best feature is being able to save your combos and settings and see what other people came up with.",Quite Possibly The Best I've Seen
1,2022-04-20 13:15:35,"It’s very annoying that the app repeatedly asks to rate the last story, sound, or meditation played. It does it every time I open the app or close out a sound. This makes me want to end my subscription not use it. Fix or remove this function please.  Also, saved playlists are not available across different devices. What’s the point of the storing the Favorites, but not the playlists we create? I have to spend time recreating playlists on my account on different IOS devices. It’s annoying& time consuming.  The app just goes silent in the middle of playing any sleep story or meditation after a while. Having to wake up to troubleshoot & force close the app to play again defeats the purpose of having a peaceful sleep through the night while trying to listen to the sounds.",Repeatedly asked to rate. Playlists don’t save.
5,2018-06-19 04:44:43,I purchased this app after using it for one night. I am an intermittent sleeper. I can go months without a problem. Then the next thing you know I'm sleeping maybe 3 consecutive hours a night. It takes a toll on me and nothing outside of medication or pure exhaustion would break the cycle for me until now. I have had this for a full week and it has helped greatly with my insomnia. So far I have quickly worked up to a solid uninterrupted 6 hours of sleep. To be able to stop my pattern two weeks into it instead of 3 months feels unbelievable. Give the the basic app a shot. You won't be sorry and you'll upgrade too.,So far sleep
2,2019-03-10 16:41:34,"This app used to be my favorite and I used it for many months. Initially, you got a handful of sounds and had to pay a one-time fee of about $20 for the rest of them. Because I loved it so much, I paid it and it was totally worth it because I had access to all the relaxing sounds for as long as I wanted.   Recently, I noticed about half of the sounds I once had full access to are locked. Now they want you to pay a yearly fee to have everything. So, it seems they can change the cost at any time or completely change what you have access to despite whatever you already paid for.    I can’t quite bring myself to delete this app yet because it’s gotten me through a lot of nights, but it’s out to get your money at the end of the day. Disappointing.","Great app, but they’re out for your money now"
5,2018-06-18 01:32:01,"Not only are there more choices for sounds than most free sleep sound apps, you can customize (combine) them. Great quality sounds, for the most part. Other sound machines I have used get annoying after a short while because the pattern in the sound repeats so frequently. You do notice that a little in some of the sounds, but not as badly and not as often. My favorite combo that I use almost every night is cavern (dripping water sound) + night (reminds me of warm Summer nights spent camping). I get cold very easily, so using a fan year-round for the white noise is not an option. I tell everyone I know that does that to grab this app.",Best sleep app
5,2018-06-11 17:47:48,"I am a licensed professional counselor with my doctorate in clinical psychology.  I have looked for many apps to use professionally and personally for anxiety and stress reduction and have found this app to be the most beneficial.  The meditation scripts are effective and very soothing.  I also find the ability to control the background sounds/music to be helpful.  I do wish there was a way to control the music/sound volume separate from the reader's voice.  Some of the scripts are somewhat short leaving the listener wanting to hear more.  All in all, even with those minor shortcomings, this does seem to be the best app for meditation that I have found.",Professional use...
5,2018-03-16 01:33:00,"Wow what a great app! That white noise is really nice to listen to while falling asleep. Plus, I think it’s awesome that you can listen to the sounds even when browsing or listening to a guided meditation as well as audio books and other sounds on the app! One thing that I think would be a great add would be to record your own sounds like a favorite song or an instrument that you play, even just the sounds that your home makes on a regular basis. Then, just put the sound on a loop and your good to go! Other than that this is super awesome and I think this app is a must have for anyone who loves getting a good nights sleep or need some music for yoga nerds like me :3",Wowee! 030
5,2017-12-22 08:22:37,"One of my friend's had this app on her phone and began playing around with it for me when I was having a very stressful day. I was hooked when she showed me how you can build multiple sounds together to achieve customized sounds to relax to. For example, you can choose ""wind in trees,"" ""thunderstorm,"" ""chimes,"" and ""frogs"" as a particular customized set. There are a lot of options to choose from. There are some in-app purchases for guided meditations, even more sounds, and a few others, though I have not looked into those yet. I really like this app and am interested to see what more it has to offer. I highly recommend it!",A Really Great and Flexible App for Relaxation
5,2023-10-28 11:15:12,"Created a sounds and music mix, liked that for a year or so. Then I added a guided MEDITATION. Within days I fell asleep before it ended...until the scary pandemic, the hate-filled rhetoric during the campaign and after the election. I was worried. OVERWHELMED, my chest was tight and my mind was racing every night when I tried to sleep. I started looking through the list of meditations from RELAX MELODIES’ and subscribed. I saw a stress option meditation tab. Adding PRE-SLEEP mgtz to my music mix, and stress option meditations literally saved my sanity. I fall asleep quickly and STAY asleep. For me, this app is worth every penny. Grateful.☮️",I finally subscribed. Worth Every Penny!

I’ve been introduced to amazing teachers such as Sarah Blondin who is one of the best and kindest spiritual leaders of guided meditations.   I love the timer which provides options to add chimes, bells, drums, etc and ambient sounds to one’s practice.  The value of a yearly memberships is unbeatable compared to some other meditation classes and websites.  I have used Insight  Timer app for over 10 years.

5,2018-05-21 14:49:13,"I love this app. One of my twins would only calm down with white noise and I happened upon this app. It’s so awesome! You can mix and match any sounds. I have a mix I use for daytime when I want more noise and then a mix at night when I want a calmer atmosphere for the babies. I love that you can adjust each sound individually to get more or less of it so you can really customize your mix. I play it through a wireless speaker so I can still use my phone and move around. The only small downside is that if someone calls you it turns off the sounds and plays through my speaker, but that’s a phone issue and not the app, obviously!",The best for babies!
4,2018-10-08 09:58:11,"Before using this app I’d had a difficult time trying to relax myself before sleep. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and honestly hadn’t slept this soundly in a long time. The relaxation features which are to put you to sleep fast actually put me out within minutes. I’d give five stars, but I’m unable to use the majority of features due to my using the free version. I would gladly pay a $5-10 fee for the full version, but $100 is too much. Especially since apps come and go so quickly. Been burned in the past when I’d paid $70 for an app and it was gone a few months later. Other than the extreme price tag for the full version, I really enjoy it.",Puts me right to sleep.

As a kid I always found the sound of rain and thunder very relaxing and whenever it stormed is when I always had my best sleep.  This app allows you to put different sounds together to create something very relaxing for your liking. I always listen to the ones with rain, thunder, wind, etc. along with the body relaxation meditation. I sleep like a baby EVERY night!!!! I fall asleep very relaxed and wake up very refreshed and it helps calm me down when anxiety tries to get to me sometimes. All around it's an amazing app. I recommend this to any and everyone!!!",I love it!!!
5,2023-07-27 04:14:03,"Better sleep is the best for me. I have used it almost every night for two years. I’ve gone through 2 phones with it.   Better sleep is amazing because most of the time there is absolutely no ads.  And you don’t even have to pay for the subscription because you still get really good options. All you need to do is basically set up a account and set a sound time for how long you want then it will turn off. plus there is stories that it reads to you and meditation, which really helps when I’m energetic at night. This app gets me to sleep in 3-5 minutes! BEST SLEEPING APP EVER!!! ❤️❤️",THE BEST!
2,2023-07-10 01:45:14,"I think Better Sleep is great and all, but it is constantly asking me if I want to level up Better Sleep to unlock more sounds, Stories, ETC, but all I want to do is get into one of my mixes quickly so I can get to bed and sleep. I also turn my brightness on my phone down so I don’t pick up my phone at night and get flash banged, and when it asks me stuff, I can’t even see the cancel button so I have to kinda guess were it is. I recommend this app if you don’t mind adds or just pay for it, but otherwise, don’t get it. Sorry producer, get good. Jk I’m not rude like certain people! You have a great future and a great app!

And you can save your mixes. Need a timer..? And a alarm... ? This app has you covered. All free without no pop up adds.

A newer feature that earned this app 5 stars from me is the ability to adjust the volume of each sound you choose and save your custom mix. For instance, I enjoy river & rain mixed with nature, but those crickets were so obnoxiously loud it would drive me bonkers and I would have turn it off.

I’ve just looked into the sounds tab, which is why I originally got the app; i didn’t want to buy a sound machine but wanted it on my phone, and there are so many sounds I lost count.  Only downside is that the app isn’t free, but it is comparable to other apps on the market for quality and pricepoint.",So far so good
5,2022-03-22 00:59:56,"I got this app awhile ago and didn’t really use it. Then a friend said they use Calm so I tried that. When I got used to listening to sleep stories I opened Better Sleep and it has a lot more stories! And I absolutely love the way you can choose sounds and mix them together. My goodness!  My husband and I had been arguing with Alexa every evening with her sleep sounds app. We’d say Alexa play Wind and Rain but she would only play Wind.  We’d try to say it faster and we’d be exhausted from trying. With Better sleep I can click on Wind then add Rain, then add a little music or whatever I want to mix together.",Love it
1,2023-01-11 03:51:04,"Recently downloaded the app again. Pretty horrible experience. I can’t believe I have to pay $60 a year just to sleep. This is ridiculous. So what you’re trying to say is you’re charging $60 a year just for us users to sleep. Why? Why would you do that? I love your app. I am completely blind and I can’t see it so your app help me fall asleep. I can’t see anything to imagine so when I use your app and use noises and I can imagine what they look like. But, your app is not compatible with my screen reader. If you could be so kind as to make it compatible and get in contact with Apple, then that would be great. Also, how are you supposed to access the choose your own sounds? I do not know how to do this. If you would be so kind as to tell me, that would be very great and I would rate you guys five stars. Thank you.",Needs work
3,2022-07-19 12:24:48,"I’ve had this app for many years. Throughout most of my childhood, the relaxing sounds from this app are what u fell asleep to. But recently, they made it so that almost all the sounds were locked unless you bought premium. After a day or two, they quickly reversed their mistake, but there are still far too many locked sounds. It used to be that there were barely any locked sounds. I believe that, yes, premium should be a feature that unlocks certain meditations, stories, etc., but that the sounds at least should be mostly unlocked. I understand that the developers need to make revenue from the app, but restricting the sounds like this is too far.",Too many locked sounds

It is the only app I have found where you can turn your iPad screen off and still listen to the sounds. There are a lot of features in the free version, including a sleep timer, but I do wish that there was more music to choose from, and not just sounds. So far, it has been working for me, and the possibilities of the sound combinations are almost endless. I would definitely recommend this if you are having trouble sleeping and need some soothing sounds.",Very good.
5,2021-03-25 04:21:18,"This app is INCREDIBLE. I can honestly hardly believe how much of it is free!!! I get a lowkey infinite loop of any of the free sounds. That’s INSANE. And there are so many free options!!! Granted, the locked ones look super tempting, but for now I’m honestly so content with the free options. I lowkey feel like I’m in a forest when I listen to my custom mix. I can close my eyes are night and during the day and feel the peace from nature.

It usually takes me 2-3 hours to fall asleep at night, so it’s nice to try and relax during that time. I thought I’d give the meditations a shot and did the free trial. I was absolutely shocked. Most of the meditations are only 15-20 minutes long or less, and I would be passed out by the end of every one of them. I would wake up the next morning having slept through the night, not even remembering the end of the meditation. For whatever reason Aster J. Haile’s meditations just knock me out.

My personal favorite is astral blessings and eternal sounds. I got into meditation because of this app. For people who might be religious and don’t like the meditation side of this app I still encourage you to buy this for the sounds.

The sounds are actually super realistic, and they transport you to that scene on the seashore or in the rainforest, wherever you may wish to go. If I put my AirPods in and play this app, sometimes I’ll forget after a while and think it’s actually thundering and stupidly ask Siri when it will stop. She then says, “It’s currently sunny and eighty-seven degrees,” because I think Siri hates me.

It helps me let go of the day and relax before bed. On the nights where my pain is high that I can’t sleep, I either use the meditation or listen to one of the stories.

But it always sounds slightly choppy when the phone screen is off. I know it’s a small detail, but it would be nice if that were fixed. I’m not sure if it can, but I hope so.

Unfortunately, the automatic functions apparently don’t work and have to be manually guided in terms of going to sleep and waking up. One day, it looked like it had interpreted my waking correctly, but then decided suddenly that I had been asleep for an extra 6+ hours. This assumption and resulting bad data couldn't be edited, so any analysis of the quality of my sleep is worthless; garbage in, garbage out. The support person told me they had removed the ability to edit time asleep. I have requested a refund. It’s too expensive for something that doesn’t help improve sleep. There are far cheaper sound apps out there.",Sleep Analysis Doesn’t Allow Editing
5,2018-07-31 07:49:06,"This app is among my favorites. There are so many ways to customize the mood and atmosphere with the wide range of sounds that are available in this app. Each night at bedtime, my son and I listen to to this while we read a book or talk about the day. This app allows you to save your favorites, and he and I had fun refining the mix. My kids, like many, spend time split between  my home and their dad's, which can be very difficult. I was actually able to send them our ""Mama Blend"" via iMessage one particularly rough night, and it was such a sweet way to connect with them. To me, that makes this reasonably priced app worth every penny.",Brilliant
2,2020-06-08 09:00:23,"I have had this app for years. It’s was better when I first got it. Now they are constantly moving sounds around, which makes it harder to find the ones I use most. The functions don’t always work. Sometimes I have to hit the on & off function multiple times before it finally takes. I don’t use the timer feature because I like it running all night to cover the sounds of my bulldog Penny. She snores & it helps to block that out somewhat...she can get pretty loud.😉 In the past 6 months or so this app has started shutting down 1 to 2 times a night, although not every night. I find it frustrating that I have to continually go back into the app to turn it on again. Am I the only one this is happening to? Getting ready to look for a replacement.",Keeps shutting off
5,2018-07-20 10:18:27,"I have only been using the free version for a few nights, but quickly became enamored with it. It was fun learning it and putting my own mix together. I’m a big fan of beautiful nature sounds, and especially the spring and summer night sounds. So my first (and so far only) mix is “Night” which is crickets and “Peepers” which are the frogs that signal spring is here with their night songs. I would love to have cicadas too, but haven’t found them if they are even available. I tried the alarm last night, but it didn’t go off this morning. I’m not dinging them at this point because it may have been operator error.",What a snoozer
5,2018-06-29 02:54:10,"This app is so helpful for sleeping. I can mix all sorts of sounds to help me sleep at night and it works. I can drown out the other city sounds and peacefully drift off to sleep. I also use the sleep timer to help me have a good bedtime routine. I LOVE this app and I think you should get it. One downside is that you have to have a membership in order to get half of the sounds, but it is still worth  it. I also have relax meditation and you should get it to. It has meditation courses you can follow, and some different types of sounds... but it does have the membership situation as well, another downside. But other than that both apps are great!",Love it!
5,2018-05-13 08:27:59,"I use this app every night. I normally use a fan, and I’ve found that having this with me when I’m away and don’t have one is great! Now I use both at home. Totally customizable and it doesn’t effect my alarm.   I am 22 weeks pregnant and I’ve had insomnia, restless leg syndrome, and excessive vomiting the entire time. Between the three I was sleeping maybe 2 hours a night and working and attending grad school. I sleep on the couch most nights. This app helped me start falling back to sleep sooner where normally I would be awake for 2 hours at a time miserable. Eventually I started sleeping for much longer as well.   Definitely recommend.",Awesome app!!!!!!
4,2018-05-15 04:44:43,"I originally paid $5 for this app several years ago before they overhauled it. I really liked that app and it was really nice. But they completely did away with all of its features. However, the features of this app are far more beneficial and better, but I don't have access to the full content like I did before when I paid full price for the the full version of the app. I'm not sure what the cost of the app I have now would be, but for $5 or less it's a huge bargain. There are some buggy issues with it most dealing with runtime and shutdown, but nothing that's severely hindered my experience with this app. Highly recommend.","Pretty Good, ripped off long time customers though"
5,2018-03-19 05:53:49,"Turn your thoughts off as you allow yourself to listen intently to the sounds of this app. Picture a happy, carefree place while you listen. I’ve had tears in my eyes as I focused on the sounds in this app. It’s been a huge help at the end of the day, especially as a tinnitus sufferer. I plug in headphones and listen. The sounds drown out the tinnitus and allow me to relax. My favorite sounds are the thunder/rain storms, piano, Jupiter, and eternity. There are so many sounds to choose from, something for everyone. This is the best relaxation app I’ve found. My 10 year old daughter loves this app as well. I would play this in a baby nursery.",The perfect way to end the day
5,2022-10-18 04:44:52,"I’ve used RelaxMelodies/BetterSleep.. For years- It’s honestly an amazing app and it’s helped me fall asleep almost instantly. I went to turn on my rain sounds earlier but when i clicked it, it showed the starting screen then shot me back to my home screen.. I can’t find any information on this and i’m hoping any of you could help? (I’ve updated, re-downloaded and shut down my phone.. Nothing seems to work.) Thank you in advance!! <3  This issue has been resolved! To all of the wonderful people who work for BetterSleep… Thank you for all the help!",App won’t let me in (updated)
5,2022-01-23 04:23:19,"My personal favorite app. It simply does not get any better than this. Things like the background sound continuing after the spoken presentation ( so if / when you drift back awake you’re not sure where you are in that presentation, the soft positive voices, the obvious time and care taken to prepare and present these all combine together to make this THE App to purchase Do wish the longer ones would be available again ( heard the eqyptian temple two or three times and now it simply times out - same with others of similar time / length)",Easily the very best of the best in its class
5,2021-06-02 05:20:05,"My favorite thing about this app is the mixing feature. For example, I love falling asleep to rain sounds and city sounds. Unlike other apps where you just choose a sound, this one gives you the option to mix multiple sounds together, and choose the volume level of each one. So I usually do a blend of rain, thunder, city sounds (like traffic), crowd (background noise of people talking), and wind in trees. And 2nd feature I like about this app is that you can leave it on in the background behind music/podcasts, which helps me stay focused. Def recommend.",Cool features
5,2020-04-18 02:54:48,"If you're looking for an app that gives you options for meditation, concentration or relaxation (binural), and beautiful sounds (my favorite include Jupiter, cavern, and Toscana,) look no further. Whenever I have trouble falling asleep, I plug into this app. Whenever I'm on a plane and want to tune out the engine with birds chirping, I plug into this app. Whenever I need to #GTD, I combo the binural beats with sounds of a rushing river. Look no further, this (and its sister app Relax Oriental) is what every rushing human seeking zen could use.  3 years later, this is still one of the best sound apps out there. Love the new sounds and ability to layer different types of concentration beats.",My go to sound app
5,2019-08-06 04:18:09,"I really like Relax Melodies. It’s just that some things glitch or don’t work. Every once in a while the app will crash. Maybe it’s because my device is old, that I don’t know. Either way, I highly recommend that you download it and don’t unlock before you are sure it’s worth the money. I do LOVE how you can select and mix and adjust the sounds however you like. I think that it would be pretty amazing if Calm and Relax Melodies joined! I think that would be one of the best health and fitness apps out there. I hope you developers out there consider this. Both Calm and Relax Melodies aid my restless sleep. Thank you! 💙😴",Highly Recommend
5,2018-10-01 07:13:54,"do you struggle with falling asleep at night because of how overly stressed you are? do you have nightmares from past events which effects your sleep? do you have bad anxiety which also effects your sleep? does the silence scare you and a lot of noise make you anxious? all of these things apply to me, and i use relax melodies. you are able to choose up to 12 sounds and put them together to make one big sound that is most relaxing to you. it helps me sleep, it helps me breathe, and it helps me calm down. I definitely recommend this app if you struggle with anything that i listed above. great app for trying to sleep!!",5/5
5,2018-01-16 04:14:21,"My whole family uses either a sound machine clock or sound app as they’ve slept but I was the only one who hasn’t tried it. I downloaded this app one day when I was trying to read a book and  I wanted to drown out the nose of my rowdy family in the house. It was amazing! I left it on all night and I’ve never slept better. The sound choices are awesome, there are no app glitches, and I really appreciate the fact that there is a timer. I don’t keep my phone near me while I sleep (across my bedroom) and the timer allows the app to automatically close after any allotted time that I choose. It’s perfect! Thank you.",My favorite!
5,2017-06-24 00:23:08,"I downloaded both the Relax Melodies and Relax Meditation apps together, liked them both and had much difficulty picking which one to go pro on during this promotion. I ended up paying $20 for lifetime subscription on one app and to my surprise, they both went pro! I truly enjoyed these two apps a lot.   I had other meditation apps before for the past 6 months. As I became more advanced in meditating, they became monotonous and boring. These two apps are advanced enough without breaking the banks! Other advanced meditation apps can easily cost $10/month, so this one is much more affordable. I have no regret going pro!",Pro is worthwhile
5,2023-10-22 05:57:59,"I’ve been using this app for about 6 months, and it’s changed how quickly I fall asleep. Before, my racing thoughts would keep me up, but now, I fall asleep in about 10 minutes or less when I turn on my sound. I alternate between a green and brown noise mix and rain sounds.  I used to turn my nose up at those apps that were “free” but then you had to subscribe to use. This is the only app I’ve caved on about that, and it was totally worth it. Even my dog has developed a sort of Pavlovian response to it; whenever I put it on, he hops into bed and curls up, haha.",Can’t sleep without it!
5,2018-09-04 14:41:11,"And why didn’t someone invent this type of app sooner? DOWNLOAD IT! Some of the content is free which I kept me entertained/interested until I paid for the subscription.  I am a real penny pincher so I had a hard time justifying paying for the app at all, but it is well worth the yearly price.  I love having the option of being able to CUSTOMIZE my music to suit my needs. Also, being able to save the song I created so I can go back to it when I want. It doesn’t matter what you need it for, (meditation, yoga, help sleeping, peaceful white noise) this app will play it for you if you pay for it or not.

But realized perhaps the company was acquired. First of all, you are literally gamifying people being able to sleep for your own profits. You have spinning wheels like gambling, discounts everywhere you look, etc —  I haven’t been more disappointed in an app in a really long time. As an employee of the tech industry and start up community, I find the subscription model a reasonable way to profit off of a reasonable product. However, for those who opt out of the subscription, the inherent manipulation via classic techniques for an app that is supposed to promote wellness honestly made me feel dirty using it.",Don’t gamify and monetize people’s ability to sleep

Most importantly, the rude awakenings from sudden silence at 30mins to 7hrs into sleep (causing chaos from my birds, & me having to use my brain to work my ipad/iphone…never getting back to sleep, especially after only 3+ hrs of sleep). When I check it, I see the app totally crashed and other times it shows it’s still there, but that it’s needing to be 🤷🏻‍♀️<unpaused>. Last nt was last time! Took my rx (that only helps me fall asleep) knowing I had 10 min before eyes forcibly close, pull covers back, open app, it immediately closes… over & over. So tried using phone, same thing happens.

My 1 & only complaint is when trying to get a few different things to play in a certain order & save to have my favorites ready at bed time or when I simply want to relax. Maybe it’s just me but I’ve not been able to figure it out or maybe I’m not smart enough to understand the directions. Either way I purchased the app years ago & it’s the only complaint I have & the reason I use it so little anymore, sadly.

This app is so versatile as it allows me to listen to a single sound or a combination of sounds that soothe me to sleep.  The free version even allows me to make and save my own ""mix"".  I also love the timer option so it turns off after 30 minutes.  I'm always asleep before it shuts down and have been getting great sleep since I started using this app.   I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you need white noise to help you sleep!",Fantastic app - so much variety!

I'm using it again today & realize what I've been missing - this app is awesome. Has beautiful soothing nature sounds that can calm you fast & put you in a state of mind where you feel outta your body & peaceful. I love it!! I recommend it for any who needs some noise to fall asleep like me or if you have insomnia or sleep problems or if you just wanna simply meditate! Absolutely love this app!!,Amazing app for soothing & meditation like you never seen before!!

I’m a midnight shift worker and it doesn’t include me 🥺 2. More hypnosis meditations. I love them. I would love to explore a hypnosis guided toward radical compassion/ radical acceptance. 3. It would be ever greater if you could put several meditations on a queue. I have a few go-to meditations. If one doesn’t work I might try another.

So I decided to download this app to see how well it would help me de-stress. It was amazing, considered that even without premium it was still realy great. It’s better than other apps where you need premium to do most of the app. It helps a lot that I’m not the fastest or best sound-sleeper. On the plane I slept about 60% faster than I ussaly sleep.

I use this app while riding home on the bus and it makes the ride much smoother and relaxing for me especially waiting out through traffic.

I use it all the time so I'm not listening to the sound all night long, just enough to get me to sleep. If it takes more than 30 minutes, I change the sounds. Overall, great app, I love it.

The only thing I want is the ability to control the pause and play from the control center like I can a music app. When I take out one of two AirPods from my ear, I would like the option to choose whether this app's playback automatically pauses (like music apps do on default) or keeps playing.  Love the UI, but it can be a bit cumbersome to scroll through all the pages of sounds to find which ones are currently active. It would be nice to quickly see a list of active sounds to turn them off or put them on pause. The new UI refresh is much nicer though!","Great app, want audio controls"

Way neat app. You’re able to set the timer either by timer or clock settings which is also very handy. I like this app and it’s algorithm which keeps things naturally interesting. Some apps you can just way too easily anticipate the next “wave”, “chirp” etc to the mix, while this app keeps things mixed well and very natural sounding. Really does make me feel like I’m actually out camping. Very neat app. We’ll done",Very pleasing and helps me sleep

With this app you can make your own sounds to fall asleep to which is so helpful to me! It also can track your sleep to see the time you talk at night, yawn, snore etc., I also find this very helpful because my sisters say I talk in my sleep but they never know what I say, but when I wake up if I talk I can hear what I say!

You get also get to switch on how you want your song to sound like if you do not like the first pick. This app helps me sleep better and have all my bad thoughts go and all good thoughts go to my brain!!        This is the best app to help me sleep!!!

I saw this app and fell in love with it right away & so did my son . This app has made such a big difference in my family . It’s given are whole family a good nights rest and I want to thank you for making this app . And without this app my son would never fall asleep !

Also, they have this cool sound breathing feature to guide your inhale and exhale, but they don’t let you change the sounds that go with that. When you need to hold your breath, they have set this awful loud mechanical sound (it’s the Jupiter sound), it is absolutely not soothing. I wish the developer would let you select what sounds you want to listen to for the sound breathing.   Overall, it’s not really useful anymore and I’ll be looking for a new app.",Used to be great.

I literally downloaded this app 1 minute ago, played around with it for 30 seconds, and decided I NEEDED to write a review. I’ve never written a review in my life, no app has been worthy - until now. I don’t believe you should have to pay for quality sleep and although many apps expect that you should have to, this one is not the same. There is a pro version but I honestly don’t understand what it does and I am perfectly content with never finding out. My brain is infinitely grateful. Thank you, and goodnight.",I’M IN LOVE

I love that I can have multiple sounds going at once to personalize it to my own tastes. I use the free version and I love how many noise options I have to pick from!! Another cool thing is the timer settings.. instead of ringing an alarm the sound shuts off. Love this feature since it’s a more calm way to wake up. opposed to something blaring at my face to let me know morning has come too soon!  Highly recommend. Never had any problems!!,Great options!

I searched around the internet for ways to get rid of insomnia and this app was recommended to help soothe and calm the mind.  I have adopted a better bedtime routine and Relax Melodies has helped me focus on the soothing sounds and has helped me relax my mind so that I am not laying awake for hours on end with my mind racing.  I am not saying this knocks me out right away, but it has gradually helped me.

The app is great for that, but only when it works which is about half the time.  Every night before bed, I turn the Sleep Tracker on and set one of the sounds or meditations to go with it.  In the morning, at least half of the time I find out that it recorded nothing. I’m not certain what is happening after I go to sleep or why no info at all will be there.

However, there are too many locked items you can’t listen to if you can’t pay the membership fees. I personally don’t like that and think maybe all people who download this app should get two week free trial then remove access but let them decide if they want to pay the subscription. If they don’t want to then they should stop getting hassled about the subscription but maybe you could try to get them to pay every month or two. Overall great app.",Great app but too many locked items
5,2022-09-18 05:01:40,"this app is so helpful to my sleep. i have had trouble falling and staying asleep and not a lot of apps ever helped. they either had what other people need or never recommended what i needed. i found this app and at first i had really low hopes, but i use it almost every night now!! the app itself can show you different meditation guides, songs and noises to help you sleep, and if none of the recommended playlists help, you can make your own! The app has been so helpful and helps me to stay asleep, and fall asleep, like its nothing. 10/10 recommend",amazing!!
5,2022-08-30 19:19:55,"One of the few apps that brings me happiness every time I open it! The app is stunning to use, so visually pleasing. I listened for hours when I first discovered the app, it was the perfect background to a relaxing evening at home, and put me in a loving, mellow mood. I love the bedtime stories, guaranteed to put me to sleep. I also love the “time for bed” reminder you can set to go off at the same time every night. I’m such a night owl I lose track of time and often go to bed late, the reminder helps keep me in check and reminds me to wind down my evening at the right time.",Beautiful melodies
5,2022-07-09 06:45:34,"I love this app so much! I really do use it on almost a nightly basis. The subscription is a worthwhile way to invest in yourself and in your sleep. However, since yesterday, my app will not open. I’ve tried opening it through the App Store, on my Home Screen, and in the search area where all apps are stored. I also restarted my phone, and still no luck. I hope that this is something that can be fixed soon because I’ve started to rely on the app for sleep, so not having it especially when I’m paying for it is difficult",An every night necessity
5,2022-01-16 01:04:10,I’m just waking up... I’ve used this app in the past (been a while) and thought I’d was great. Excellent sounds and you can mix them yourself.👌🏾 But this morning I let thousands of thoughts keep me up. One of my thought was that I should shut the rest of the thoughts out with help from this app but my cell was about to die and getting up would wake the house up. Come morning my 1 year old and son was up so I charged my phone with enough time to use one of my soothing mixes to put myself AND my son back to bed for 2 hours. Yes! I was so happy I wrote this review. Thanks RM,Must use app
5,2021-04-14 04:01:36,"Hi, I’m Kaylee and I really adore this app. I love all of the sounds like campfire, the ASMR stories, and sounds. this is a really wonderful app, and I totally recommend it.  And bye the way something that is cool about this app is you can get the help and support you need bye just clicking on setting, then help and support, and then right whatever problems your having or if you want to recommend some bug fixes!  Relax melodies, keep your work up your doing awesome on your design and I am very happy with everything on this app thank you for helping me fall asleep! 😁",If you don’t trust this app read this..... 😃
5,2021-02-21 17:48:51,"I'm hard to please when it comes to apps, and I think this one is really good! Unlike other apps, which only give you less than 20% of what they have on premium for 50 dollars a year, this one has half the sleep sounds unlocked. This way, if you don't have money, you can make your own sounds and customize it however you want. Bedtime stories, meditation guides, and the music made by the creators is mostly unavailable, but that's all right. The creators need to make money somehow. I recommend it for anyone who has trouble falling asleep and doesn't want to make in-app purchases.",Pretty satisfied!
5,2019-07-21 07:45:19,"I am a board-certified music therapist and a Psychological Assistant so I work a lot with different types of people, primarily to help with depression, anxiety, and pain. I have used this app to explain the importance of mindfulness practice in wellness seminars and in individual therapy. I have also used it to support live guided visualization a with groups. What I love the most about it is that you can select music from your own playlist and add the sound effects (or downloaded script) over the song. When we have a personal, emotional connection to the music, it enhances the experience tenfold. I suggest this app to all my patients!",BEST app for mindfulness practice
5,2018-06-06 10:53:47,"I’ve tried several sound apps but this one is my favorite so far. You don’t have to just pick from specific ready made choices. You can fine tune the different sounds & volume of each added sound to create your own customized “mix”. I Then save them to quickly load up when wanted.  I created one that sounds like a summer night with crickets, frogs & a fire crackling. Sometimes I like adding in a creek sound as well. Very fun It will play throughout the night or use the timer within the app. Great app & very easy to use. I highly recommend trying it out!",Very relaxing with many choices!
5,2018-06-02 04:56:12,"I have used this app for years, well my son has. I use it as white noise in my toddler's room at night. It's easy to build gentle, soothing sounds that soothe him while minimizing sound coming from the rest of the house. The sound is best if you play it through speakers as opposed to your devise. I use it on and old iPhone with a clock docking station. This way it's constantly charging while playing. Lately I started using the tones with headphones while reading at night. It really does relax me. I love this app so much that I just might buy the pro version, though the free version really has everything you need.",Love this app
5,2023-08-10 03:34:44,"I’ve never left a review on an app, but being that I’ve used this app every night for over five years to help me (and my children) sleep- I think I should share. It started out for me as just an app for white noise, which I love bc I can close the app and it will still play. I love everything from the meditations to the sleep stories, and I can customize mixes, save my favorites, and so much more. I pay for it monthly, and I fall asleep within about 5 minutes. It practically pays for itself. I share it with everyone I know bc it just works.",Best sleep every night
4,2023-11-07 04:19:38,"I have had this app, and a subscription to it, for years now. I love the app, the sounds, the meditations, i love everything about it. Except the bugs. Ive had trouble opening the app on multiple occasions, but i have always been able to fix it. Now the app will not open at all. I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling, restarting my phone, deleting apps for space, etc., and it still will not open. Im so disappointed as i’ve used this app for sleeping and even mental health purposes for years! It would be five stars if i could open the app but I’m afraid it will never work again :(((","Love the app, not the bugs :("
5,2019-05-30 05:57:25,"I upgraded this app about 2 years ago paying $20 annually, which I thought was fair, getting access to all of the sounds and features. Recently this app was updated and the sounds and features that I originally had access to, are only accessible on the new “pro” edition, which is a hefty upgrade cost. It is fine to offer new features for more money, but to take away features that I was already promised in my current annual contract lacks integrity!   I will no longer use this app and will make sure that my husband and friends stop supporting this greedy and dishonest company.",Lacking integrity
1,2023-07-17 01:04:08,"I used to love this app and would have given in max stars in the past. I even purchased a yearly subscription - twice. Unfortunately since my most recent purchase, almost a year ago, the app has not worked. It crashes whenever I try to play anything. I have been in contact with the developers who apparently could not figure it out and stopped responding with the promise to get back to me but never did and I have not been able to get ahold of anyone since. I am sorely disappointed and irritated that I wasted my money on a subscription that hasn’t worked for almost a year now.  I have kept checking back to see if anything has changed with no luck and I’m giving up. Only wish I could find something that comes close to what I enjoyed with this app.",Unfortunately
4,2022-08-16 03:46:29,I have struggled with sleep most of my life (I’m 55 now). I have taken Ambien for years and even then still have struggles. I recently learned about brown noise and wondered if it would help. I actually never expected to get the result I did. The first night I tried it I slept better than I had in a very long time. I will be trying other sound options as well but for now I can’t thank whoever came up with this app enough!! The only reason I didn’t do 5 stars is I want to try out some more options in the app first. If they work as well as the brown noise then I will definitely up my rating.,I was shocked it worked so well!!
5,2018-09-18 07:27:48,"Bought a lifetime subscription to unlock a few sounds I wanted and it came with so much more. I don't think I'll ever get through all of my options (mediation for sleeping, lucid dreaming, napping, recharging, etc) but it's great to have them. There are also a ton of popular tracks made by other users but so far that's the one part of the app I don't use. Love the timers--you can set it for a certain time (8AM) or a certain amount of time (90 minutes) and you have the option of having your noise fade out and exit the app or to play a specific chime like most alarms do.",The upgrade comes with endless meditations
5,2023-01-12 05:19:57,"I have downloaded a couple similar apps before and ended up deleting them, but I’ve actually been enjoying this one. Had to catch up on some work at home recently and used the focused and alert music and I found I really was able to tune out the rest of the house and do what I needed to do.   I also tend to stay up later than I want to just messing around on my phone. I decided to try one of the sleep music settings and I was asleep much more quickly than usual.   I would recommend this app!",Better Focus and Faster to Sleep
1,2023-06-05 02:44:59,"This awesome app has been helping me sleep for over a year now. If you are debating getting premium, I highly recommend that you get it. It is more (lots more) of the great content you love. However, I have one complaint, the feature that allows you to play music from your music library is clunky and broken. The interface is bad and it does not allow you to add things to mixes, adjust the volume once your story has started, or play songs from Apple Music, even if they are downloaded. With all the energy you are putting into updating the logo, I hope you will fix this small issue. Otherwise, this application is amazing. I WILL RETURN TO FIVE STARS WHEN THE COMPLAINANT IS ADDRESSED!!! Revision: Thank you for responding, hopefully you can get an updated music player on soon :)","Amazing App, One Complaint"
5,2020-03-31 06:08:18,"I love this app because it’s so relaxing. It’s been useful to my family! Personally I’m not the person who sits around and listens to music...but this just makes me calm when I’m angry, stressed, and happy! When I go lay down to take a nap I know I will fall asleep so quickly because of the noises you can pick and listen to.  Sometimes I need to put a timer to remind myself that I need to cook meals for my family. But I wonder if I were to go to my school and play music at locker time if I would be relaxed for class and ready...or if I would get sleepy and not do good in school?",I love this app!
5,2018-06-07 05:11:05,I never write reviews of apps by thought I could at least say something short on this one. I bought this app thinking I would just try it out at night a couple times then stop using it just like every other app I get. Well not only have I continued to use it every night I find my self using it  through out the day & it keeps me in a better more relaxed mood. I recommend this app to all my friends and family and we now do the same to anyone thinking about getting this one. Well worth every cent you spend on it.,Best app I've owned since I bought the original iPhone in 2007
4,2018-08-22 04:15:34,"I researched and looked at many sleep apps and chose this one above all of them and within 24 hours I bought the premium membership I’m glad that I did. It is easy to use and requires no instruction. You can combine as many sounds as you want and adjust the volume on each one and save it in your profiles. In addition there are timers, one of which reminds you that it’s time to get ready for bed and another timer turns off. My only suggestion would be that we would have the ability to slow the tempo down on certain sounds in the same way that we adjust the volume.",Excellent! Many sounds to choose from; easy!
5,2018-03-14 02:05:09,"So aside from being confusing at first, I believe this app actually works. If nothing else than a simulator for soothing music.  I have trouble sleeping because parts of my mind never shut down, while a normal person would have. I need music to set a pattern for my ""dreams"" to follow. With out audio, some times music some times a movie I have seen a million time before, my dreams become nightmares or I wake up to every little thing.  This app continually plays a set of sounds that melodically blend together in a seamless loop. I highly recommend it to any one like me.   I fully intend on getting the full version.",Very helpful
5,2023-08-02 09:03:43,"I’ve had this app for well over ten years now and it’s been a staple in my life for a reason! I have a lifetime membership and I’ve enjoyed seeing the constant improvements through the past couple years with the additions of sleep hypnosis, guides, and soundscapes. The app really has a strong base with their library of sounds and white noises to fashion the perfect sleep mixes. The only thing I would change would be the ability to manage the pitch and speed of each sound and then this would be the holy grail of all sleep apps!",My go-to sleep app

Now when I try to use it, it tells me that sounds I’ve used ever since buying this piece of junk, are no longer in my phone, and in order to continue, I have to download the individual sounds. I am done with this nonsense! Not only is it extremely overpriced, now they’ve complicated it to the point that it’s not worth the trouble anymore. I refuse to download the individual sounds, and when my subscription expires, I will definitely not be resubscribing. There are better white noise apps, that are free of charge, without the constant problems I have encountered with this crap app!",Overpriced Junk!
5,2023-02-28 05:19:32,"To be honest, it’s not something that really needs to be fixed, in my experience whenever I start using this app, I am extraordinarily tired after a long day, and just want to play some sounds (brown noise) to fall asleep to. That being said, whenever I open this app, it takes around 3 to 5 seconds for it to actually open up and start loading. Just me being impatient but it is genuinely annoying after a while. Great app and would recommend buying the extra features (get the yearly plan.)",I love this app apart from one tiny thing
5,2022-10-25 03:16:10,"I’ve been a premium member for a long time, since it was called dream moods or something like that. Anyways I love this app. It’s versatile. It’s more than helpful for putting you to sleep. It aids with waking up, getting your day started, breathing exercises, anxiety, stress, bedtime stories, hypnosis. You can even make your own mixes and play it as background for your meditations or stories. My dog also loves it too. It helps him sleep or be calm while I’m away. I hope they add more music selections bc they have such good taste. Thank you, I look forward to your future developments.",Download now
5,2021-09-21 23:03:30,"Update: With the last update they have made it easier to change volumes for each sound. I am updating my rating to full 5 stars. Thank you!  Original:  This app saved my sanity when sleeping in a hotel. The sounds blended well together. One thing I would change is having to change volume on a selected sound. If you try to change the volume of a sound it will turn it off... not a problem, but somewhat a pain when trying select sounds when children trying to sleep.",Wonderful soothing sounds
1,2021-12-23 07:29:56,"I had this app since 2015 or 2014 to help me sleep but I had to delete it today. Since changing the name from relaxing melodies and changing ownership, most of the sounds I had used are either locked or no longer exist. The entire app has changed to compete with Headspace and other apps. That’s heartbreaking and annoying. I loved relaxing melodies because it was affordable, the sounds were realistic, the app was easy to use and there was a lot of variety. Now, you have to pay a fee to use most of the app. Why did you guys do this? Why didn’t you allow us to keep a free version and you guys do all your wannabe Headspace stuff in a separate app? Again, I’ve had this app from 2014 or 2015, so for 6 or 7 years, and you do this? Very disappointing.",They took away all the functionality

You can also set the timer to turn the app off after an hour and half. This has helped me a lot as I couldn’t seem to get out of bed with it still running.

I orignally had the sounds I needed, but then they made those sounds so you had to purchase a subscription (I only use this app a few times a year when we travel). I decided to purchase the upgrade for the app to get the sounds I needed and purchased what I was led to believe was a monthly renewing subscription that could be cancelled at any time.  Turns out, when I finally get an email from the app 12 days later, the montly billing is actually a yealry billing that bills the full annual amount and can't be cancelled or refunded...yes you can cancel it after a few days, but you have still been billed the full amont and your cancelation wont affect anything until it is up to renew in a year!

It has been wonderful to see the changes this app has gone through since having it, but the downer to it all is the monthly subscription. I had at one time paid for the unlimited sound package, which allowed me to listen to all of the sounds and meditations the app featured. I thought it was well worth the purchase. It is unfortunate to see that my features were not transferred over to the newer update. The monthly subscription is a discouragement.

As well as allowing you endless possibilities of choices to create custom sound combinations. I don’t think I can ever get to sleep without this app. Also what is great is that it’s on my phone so when I travel, I always have my noise/nature sound machine with me.

Enter Relaxing Melodies. I wear a white noise headband and listen to wind in the trees with relaxing isochronic tones, and daily meditations, and I’ve slept through the night every night since I got the app. Not only that, I fall asleep before the 10 minute meditation is even over.

But recently there seems to be an issue where after awhile of using the app, sounds that I’ve already downloaded have suddenly asked me to download  again and then other sounds that don’t even require downloading ask to be downloaded “again”. And the last half of the free sounds section has been bugging out and not playing any sound at all or even letting me tap the buttons.

2,2023-04-05 02:31:49,as long as basic service missing common features is fine for you then it’s alright. if you ever need support tho you’re out of luck. for example. i’ve tried repeatedly to get the app to play to my bedroom speakers but there just isn’t a way. i have several cellular technical certifications so i’m not stupid. sometimes i can get it to piggy back on another app but that’s iffy. i sent them a message saying it would be great if they included this service in the future. i got a reply saying “good news you can do this” but no info on where or how. fine i went into every menu option i could find again & nope. nothing there. i respond asking where it is. they replied to that email saying that since they hadn’t heard from me they were closing the ticket & were so glad they could help… scroll down an inch & you could see my email asking for more info. so i still can’t do something extremely basic & their support team is a joke. but hey with the way they keep screwing around with the layout maybe some day they’ll accidentally put it somewhere people can find.,it’s ok for what it is
5,2022-11-24 02:02:56,I think it’s a great app it’s help me sleep and the noises are so natural but I do have one flock it’s not that big you should probably just lower down how much stuff you got to be a member for maybe like three or four things you see there’s a really good story I want to hear but I have to be a member and I can’t afford that kind of money but this is a great app and I think you should update it and it’s very very good and you say I’m only 11 and when I’m sleeping and listening to this I feel Dead asleep and it makes me go to sleep very fast>333💕❤️💕♾,Awesome but here’s what I think

I love the app but can you please add a few more things to use when making a melodies? It would be very helpful because I have a hard time sleeping.

This time? EVERYTHING on the app is locked and it says I only have a free subscription. Their help and support has gone to an automated system that it goes to first before it lets you get to a human. Still waiting. The app itself is no longer easy to navigate. I am no longer recommending this app to anyone. I wasted 45 minutes of my life I won’t get back trying to get my subscription back myself.

5,2018-05-21 07:08:43,I really like this app. I love the option of being able to play different sounds at the same time. I work at night and sleeping in the daytime does provide its challenges. Using this app I can add night time sounds mixed with other sounds that I find relaxing to help me fall asleep in the daytime. This app has also helped me fall asleep faster. I use this app in my car when I am dropping off my niece at her mother's house. It makes her fall asleep and so her mother doesn't have to deal with a fuzzy 3-year old who likes to stay up late.  Get the app. Totally worth it. The free version of it is top-notch.,Loving this app

Edit: I wrote the review after downloading the app again after about a year. At that time, I only had access to 5-6 sounds. A week later I opened the app and all the original free sounds were accessible. I don’t know if it was when a new update went out but now I have all the access hat I expect from the free version.

You can save combinations and name them. There’s a timer feature that acts as a sleep timer, an alarm feature, and much more! It even has a user friendly, aesthetically pleasing interface. This app helps me relax and fall asleep like nothing else, and I didn’t pay a cent. I highly recommend it.",Great value without paying for pro
5,2022-03-04 04:10:46,"I’ve had this app installed for a while and I finally decided to do the free trial for the premium. I love it! $40/year? Great deal! Even without the premium membership, there’s a nice selection of sounds, songs, and even a couple stories to help you sleep. They also have a “wind down” option that you can set before your preferred bedtime. With my iPhone, I allowed the app to connected to my Health app to track my sleep. This app tells you how much “sleep debt” you have so you can adjust your bedtime in order to get the amount of sleep you’d prefer!",Great App!
4,2023-08-24 15:18:43,"I have used this app every night for YEARS. I created my own custom mix and play it all night (I’m a super light sleeper so this helps block out any noises). However they removed the alarm feature so I now have to use a second app for an alarm, a pain, or try and calculate the timer. I can’t tell you how many times in my sleepy haze I’ve miscalculated when the timer should stop and been late. I would easily give this app a 5+ stars if they returned the alarm feature. I also wanted others to know, in case it would be an issue for them as well.",Love this app but so sad they removed the alarm feature
1,2023-06-01 06:08:07,"I used to love this app, I really did. Worked every time. I knew every story inside out and had used every sound imaginable. I deleted it, and until recently haven’t used it. But in seek of better sleep I ended up redownloading it, assuming it would be the same it was a year or so ago. I was wrong.  Every time I open the app, every feature works except for the sounds, which is the feature I use the app for. I pay (and for that matter never stopped billing from this company) every month for this app for it to make no noise. Now there is a solution which is deleting and reinstalling, but I find it highly inconvenient to have to delete the app every single night and reinstall it, considering I’ve payed a pretty hefty amount to this company. Do better.",Deletes Every Time
5,2021-11-14 03:04:25,"I used to have this app, before I was pregnant and it helped me fall asleep and relax a lot in combination with my sleep medication. Now Im 9 months pregnant and haven’t been on my sleep medication since I got pregnant. I was lucky in the beginning that my SEVERE insomnia seems to go away with all of my pregnancy symptoms but then I hit my third trimester and the pregnancy insomnia hit. Now I’m so thankful I have this app to help fall asleep in the first place and quickly fall back asleep after my numerous bathroom breaks throughout the night. This app is the only reason I get sleep anymore!",Pregnancy insomnia
4,2022-02-24 11:49:00,"I love this app!! When I get up in the morning, I used to feel SO TIRED 🥱, but with the app I feel much more rested. One problem, is that I have to pay for it if I want all the sounds, meditations, stories, etc. And there is a 30% of deal, but the normal price is 70 dollars. Also, there’s this weird restore purchase button, if I buy premium. Which doesn’t make any sense. It should be 40 dollars a year and that’s it. If you want to feel more rested, THIS IS THE APP YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD!!!! I would totally have a five star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️review if other people weren’t saying that if I buy premium, I’ll be scammed, it’s makes me nervous 😬😖😖😡",AMAZING APP ALTHOUGH ONE PROBLEM
5,2018-08-10 05:51:48,"I’ve been looking for an actual noice machine due to my 4 month old hating silence. I was desperate and looked on the App Store instead. That’s when I came across this app. It’s helped with my baby girl but also myself. She and I both wake up way happier and she sleeps way better through the night. I’m absolutely in love. heres a huge variety of different sounds, you can alter how loud each sound is compared to others, and you can save your own mix. I have honestly never left a super high review that was this descriptive. This app has been a godsend and I can’t thank those who made it enough.",Fantastic
4,2018-11-16 09:26:30,"This app is truly something great, I have trouble sleeping and it’s nowhere easy for me to just fall asleep, but the way this app is set up it suits you completely and with that being said since I’ve been using this app, I am able to actually relax myself and go into a decent sleep. There’s many different features to the app and I like them all, there’s an option where you can put a timer on and when it’s up the mix you created stops (if you choose that setting) I typically put a timer on for 20-25mins and I’m out in close to 15 and that’s truly saying something. Thank you to the creators of this app I definitely recommend!",Ah-mazing!
3,2018-09-28 04:55:26,This is what I listen to when I’ve listed to all my Jack Johnson songs for the past week to fall asleep to and I’m sick of him. The wave sounds have an artificial feel to them. Sounds like the designer took a big Rubbermaid tub and sloshed water in it with a wooden spoon. Now and then you hear little drips on the mic. The animal sounds are like a second apart. I like them but they should be more sporadic. The explore page should have more content. I’ve had this for a few weeks and they’re always the same mixes. And finally the lifetime sleeper package is way too much. I would’ve paid $10 already if that was the case but no way I’m gonna pay $100. It is a unique app though. I’d give it a C+.,Ok- Needs a few improvements
5,2018-03-19 08:34:24,"Not sure why am just getting around to reviewing this app but I've been using it for about two years. It's perfect. It has a night clock which dims the screen except for the clock, it has a timer which turns off the sounds at a certain time or in a certain amount of time (I usually set up for 30 minutes because I'm well sleep before then). I also turn this on when I'm trying to study and need to drown out the background noise. Many options available for sounds and you can mix them to your preference. Couldn't ask for a better app!",Perfect
3,2018-06-27 05:45:45,Totally enjoyed the initial phase when the meditations were free. The meditations helped me a lot to the point that I almost always fall asleep before the 15-minute meditation ends! I love the background music and the options. Gave 3 stars because I love the previous version wherein you could get the 1st and 2nd (sometimes even 3rd) steps free before you need to buy - gives us an option to choose what we really want instead of purchasing right away. It’s a bit of a shame as I’ve been endorsing this to family and friends. Still love the nature noise/background though. This app is totally for you if you just need background music or are willing to pay for meditations.,Many sounds but limited meditations free
5,2022-12-26 07:06:25,"I switched over from Calm- they used to be user friendly until they rendered the app unusable unless you pay a fee (which i personally wouldn’t mind doing, but it felt very “cash-grabby” since ALL of the features were locked behind a paywall) BetterSleep perfectly executed giving the user a plethora of free features that you can personalize, while making the upgrade feel like a choice rather than a necessity. I hope they continue to keep it this way in the event that I decide to upgrade- thanks for the great app! I now sleep like a rock!",Great app!
3,2023-08-08 14:10:57,"The stories (sleep tales) have been getting woefully worse over the past several months. For example, the same three stories are repeated three times with just a different mode of transportation. Others are just downright boring! The older stories are so much better. Who’s choosing these things?  The meditations are interesting to listen to and actually work. The music and sounds are also very good.  I wish there was a way to get rid of stories or meditations I’d never want to listen to again so there’s not so much scrolling.  Overall it’s a good app. But someone needs to do better choosing with the stories.",Sleep Tales definitely needs attention
4,2023-03-31 01:53:19,"I honestly like this app! I love all the options you get and how you can create a mix based on what works for you. I use this to help both my daughter and I sleep at night. We have our own likes, so I created mixes accordingly. However, I just don’t know if I’m ready to commit to a year of this app after just a week…. So I’m disappointed that a yearly subscription is the only option provided after the free trial is over. No option for monthly subscription… but you can cancel anytime…. Make it make sense! Let me know when you guys create a monthly subscription and I might just subscribe.",Works!
1,2023-01-27 21:02:32,"I used this for two nights and really enjoyed it. I spent some time making different custom sound mixes for different moods, I recorded my sleep and really liked the insight into my sleeping habits. But after those two days, using the app has been a nightmare. My sleep journal wasn’t loading so I wasn’t able to see my past data, and when I tried to start the bedtime recording process, the app crashed. This happened multiple times, so I deleted the app and reinstalled it. Once I did, the functionality was restored but all my mixes were gone, as well as my past data. I used it that night, and then today the same issues returned. Unable to see my data, app crashes when tapping the “Sleep” button. A very frustrating experience overall.",App is a mess
5,2021-03-02 08:02:17,"i’ve use this app to help me go to sleep literally everyday for the past 2 years i’ve had it. there is a huge variety of different environments/white noise/music to pick from and they are always updating new sounds so you never get tired of hearing the same thing. I can’t afford paying for monthly subscription, however that literally does not stop me from using this app as frequent as i do.  if you have sleep anxiety i 100% recommend this sleep aid to block everything out even if it is just temporary. I can’t imagine sleeping without my noises anymore 😭",best sleep aid ever!!!
1,2022-10-16 15:02:48,"Original app developers made the app perfect, then the app was purchased outright and has steadily declined in quality and I recently discovered all my saved mixes have been LOCKED, and I no longer have access to them. Thanks. My guess is, the new app owners are trying to push out the original full-access buyers that paid a one-time price for full access. That, and we’re grandfathered-in, and don’t have to pay the monthly or annual subscription.  Update: Newest sw version of app doesn’t open, immediately crashes. Operating on iPhone 11 Pro Max, on the most up to date iOS version. Not to mention the fact that I PAID for full access a long time ago. Refund my money, or rollout a sw patch to fix this. Again, feels like the lifetime access owners are being pushed out.",ATLWillie
5,2020-04-16 12:09:24,"I don’t typically write reviews for apps but this app is way too amazing not to. If you are contemplating it, do yourself a favor and download the free trial week. You will not regret it. This app is worth every single penny. I’ve tried so many apps and every one seemed like it was missing “something”. I like different aspects of each app and just wished I could put them together. Then I found this app and holy crap MIND BLOWN. It incorporated all the things from other apps I loved AND so much more. Things I didn’t even know I needed in my life this app had. I am so impressed. Could not recommend enough.",Literally AMAZING
5,2018-11-29 06:53:16,"I downloaded this a few months ago to see if it could help my then 3 month old sleep, and it did! He use to scream every time I tried to get him to sleep, and he’d start screaming again the second he was put in his bed. It was awful. But now I just turn this on and he’s out within 15 minutes, and I can even put him down! He stays asleep longer which means I sleep longer. It’s helping us through the 6th month sleep regression. The nights we don’t use it he’s awake every 30 minutes to an hour and the nights we do he sleeps 2-4 hours, which is long for him.",Great sleep aid
3,2019-05-27 15:33:11,"I really like this app, but there is a lot of sounds that you need to pay for, so there isn’t a variety of sounds if you don’t want to pay for them. Most of them say “pro” in the corner, so that means you need to pay for them if you want to have that sound. This app is good if you want camping sounds, because most of those sounds are free, so I use sounds like that. But if you want sounds like kitchen sounds, or... random sounds, than you may not want this app. It’s a super relaxing app! I use it almost every night, but there isn’t a big variety at all, so if you like to have different sounds a lot than maybe you’d like a different app. I hope this helped!",Only good if you have “pro” stuff
5,2018-09-21 02:13:11,"Have been using this app for several months & it's a winner. I fine-tuned the mix a few times in order to create a perfect blend of soothing, relaxing sounds that appeal to both my husband & to me. I play this mix every night & we both sleep like babies. The app's best feature, for me, is the volume mix. I can play one or two sounds at low volumes  (monks chant) (wind chimes) & mix in additional sounds at higher volumes (Jupiter) (underwater) (wind in trees). I also appreciate that I can play this app in conjunction with an unrelated app featuring deep-sleep ""brain wave"" beats. Relax Melodies is a wonderful app & deserves five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.",Sleep Like a Baby
5,2018-07-26 05:44:44,"I came across this app a couple of years ago. I use it sometimes, especially when I am having trouble sleeping or if I am stressed. I love that you can mix a combination of sounds all at once. Ex: Rain, Thunder, birds chirping, etc. Recently I have found myself feeling stuck in the bed when I get up the morning as if I took drowsy medicine the night before. That’s probably because It’s so relaxing. 😫 I have to be careful with how often I use it because of that ! But don’t let that stop you. I’m sure it works differently for each individual. Thank you for this awesome app!   -KB",Helps me fall asleep faster!
5,2018-07-16 03:23:21,"Absolutely my favorite sounds to fall asleep to every night. Love the ability to combine the sounds you like and keep the mixes so you don't have to keep remembering what you tried and liked. Awesome for anyone who has trouble sleeping or suffers from tinnitus and needs sound to drown out the ringing in order to sleep. I couldn't sleep for even 15 minutes without it. Best relaxing sounds app on here by far, and I can fall asleep to this with 100% battery power and it will have only gone down to about 96% when I wake up in the morning. Thank you Relaxing Melodies!",Relaxing Melodies is the best!
5,2018-06-26 04:26:57,"Update:  I just bought the premium version and it's the best $10 ever spent. I sleep soundly every night, and letting my 4 year old pick the sound combinations is motivation for her to get into bed on time (she used to fight me about it). Great meditations and blog entries, too. And I love the timer that you can set to turn the sounds off whenever you want. I usually set mine for 10 hours so that I can wake up to the ambient noise as well (I do not sleep for 10 hours I just set it to that so I know it will still be playing when o wake up).   So many sounds and ways to combine them. Awesome!",Great! Still great!

Before I get into bed, I feel exhausted, but once in bed, I cannot fall asleep because my mind is still running. Ever since I downloaded this app, i can fall asleep within 10 min or less... Usually I wake up in the middle of the night but I stay asleep with this. AND I wake up feeling refreshed when I usually wake up groggy. And when I'm at work, I use the ""concentration"" sound to help me focus and let it play behind my music. Love this app! Should've downloaded this a long time ago.",Relaxing & Focused
5,2017-10-14 14:16:20,I wish I had access to all the sounds I don't have enough storage on my phone to download them I paid for the app & then I have to download sounds to my phone I should get all the sounds for the price I paid!! . that upset me!!  But I do have to say my fav. Part about this app is how I can make up my own sounds!! (Using the ones I have access to) I have a 4 year old and a newborn both boys & they seem to be very relaxed when I play certain sounds I love how I can adjust the volume of each sound & I can mix as many sounds as I want it's def. a neat app.!! But again I wish I had all the sounds,❤️👍🏼
5,2023-08-22 01:46:06,I am so grateful for this app and I can’t wait to see more people using BetterSleep. I tell everyone I know about it because it feels like a miracle that I am sleeping well again. I can’t remember the last time I fell asleep at the time I wanted to and slept through the night (I struggle with falling and staying asleep). After using this app I am getting the best sleep of my adult life. THANK YOU!!!! 🥹🙏🏻😴   I would love to offer user experience feedback though! Is there a way users can easily submit UX feedback?,I haven’t slept well in years until I started using this app
5,2023-05-29 18:16:24,"My sleep has been so much better since I downloaded this app. I use it every single night. I have my favorite readers and keep my favorite stories on playlists so that even if I wake up, a story is always playing softly and I can drop back into sleep right away.  You can add sound mixes to the background of the stories so you can feel like you’re being read to on a rainy night with a fire going in the fireplace—or play meditations, spa music—anything you need to personalize your sleep experience.

Y’all, I never pay for apps either bit the premium is the way to go. It customizes what you like to listen to, tracks your sleep and sets alarms for you say wgaaaaaaat.

5,2022-08-26 00:48:48,"Thanks to daily use of this app, my health has improved in many ways. I fall asleep faster and can go back to sleep even if I wake up in the middle of the night. I also improved my focus with work during the day and reduced anxiety with most work related stressors. As a skeptic of meditation and breathing exercises, I now make both a part of my nightly routine. I have not tried any other apps like this one but I am satisfied and definitely would recommend it to everyone.",Helped me improve sleep and other health issues
5,2022-06-01 17:37:43,"I like how it can be used as a general ambiance, meditation, and sleep-aid in the form of background/white noise.   (EDIT 2022) Since getting the lifetime subscription, it’s made leaps and bounds in improvements since back before when it was called Relax Melodies. Adding more meditations and activities to wind down to sleep.   I’ve always had problems sleeping and this is one of the only things that actually soothes me enough to sleep.  There are also features now to assist in waking up in the morning and calming down during the day without the intent of sleeping.  The bedtime stories when you need something unguided to drift off to sleep are fantastic.  And knowing your personal sleep pattern and how much sleep debt you’re getting helps prepare you and plan to sleep better in the future.  There’s lots of helpful features now that are absolutely worth it if you’re like me and need to get good sleep.","Good concept, it’s worth it (now)"
3,2022-07-28 19:09:35,"This app does not have auto sleep tracking which makes it useless. It's fun when I remember to set the tracker but that's not going to happen because I fall asleep before I realize I'm asleep and can't start it after. Thought the premium might have it locked away so I started my free trial but NOPE. 👎  Update: okay, to be fair that was fairly harsh. So your apps definitely much better then 1* but I still value automatic tracking. I understand there are requirements but if I'm not offered the option I can't agree to it. And I know there are people who would not agree to it and that's okay.  I have yet to find the ""perfect"" sleep tracker.",No auto sleep tracking?
5,2021-05-12 11:44:41,"I love this app. It has everything from meditation, to creating your own sounds  and music for your personal needs. It also offers sound waves for relaxation, sleep, healing and more.  I love that there are stories and meditations offered for kiddos. With this pandemic, my 6 year old has trouble calming down and falling asleep. It now has become our nighttime ritual to lay in bed together and listen to a story or try and body scan. I never buy the entire package offered by an app, but I’ll continue to pay annually for this one. I’m sold!!",This is the best!
3,2022-01-20 12:36:56,"When I first started using this app, you could have it playing in the background of any other sound producing app; meaning I could have sounds playing through Better Sleep/Relax Melodies, while having something playing through other media players. This was a HUGE part of why I loved this app so much. Because it gave me the ability to really customize my sleep sound experience, through its flexibility. Now I can’t do that. The music they added in is nice, but it doesn’t beat being able to have my mix of sounds as well as a nice guided mediation from another app.","I really used to love this app, but they took away my favorite part"
2,2022-01-19 02:25:04,I’m from the Midwest and now live in South Florida. I love the sound of cicadas and couldn’t believe I finally found an app with that sound. Unfortunately you have to pay A LOT of money for it. I’d be willing to do it if I could hear the sound before I purchased. You should offer a sample…like they do on iTunes so we know what it sounds like. Until then I’ll be keeping the free version and looking for other apps. PS…save your time answering and telling me you have a 7 day free trial like you did for all of the other reviews. I’m aware of that. I don’t want to go through the hassle of entering a credit card and signing up. You need to have a sample available of the sound. Easy to add and will result in a lot more subscribers.,Cicadas!
5,2019-10-28 10:22:50,"After the most recent update for the app and two Apple updates, this app has become useless. I can set the timer and the app still runs all night long. It doesn’t matter if I set it for one hour or five hours it never turns off.  Just this morning I had to turn it off manually after it ran for 6 1/2 hours when I had it set to turn off after 5 hours.

I love the fact that I’m able to mix and match sounds to find what relaxes me the most. I love that I can save multiple mixes and even sample ones that others have made! I also appreciate the timer to close the app so my phone doesn’t die.   Haven’t had a chance to try the breathing exercises yet but I have been looking through them and they’re all extremely helpful. Can’t believe so much is free! Definitely recommend.,Thank you!!
5,2018-05-25 03:31:25,"I love this app for sleep--I use it nearly every night. There is a wide selection of sounds (very realistic, though sound best with headphones) and the ability to create ""playlists,"" which means that the app can be used not only for soothing sleep sounds, but also it focus at work with a different playlist. I like that it can be set to automatically shut off after a while and that there is an alarm. Very useful for preserving phone battery (though this doesn't use a ton of power) or for naps.

It was fantastic for what it was, but I found I didn’t need it after moving away from our obnoxious [apartment] neighbors. Recently, I tried using again while out of town and discovered the company behind it moved to a subscription based service with all of my previously created scenes behind a new paywall. This is complete garbage moving an app that I paid for behind a recurring fee structure. For an app that I already paid for, my purchased content should not be behind an additional paywall. What’s worse, there’s no way to be refunded for the previous purchase, so I’m stuck now having paid for content I can no longer access.

Gave the guided meditation a shot too, I enjoyed it.

This has really helped me relax through these stressful times involving Covid-19 and I for sure feel that it has improved my sleeping and has made this time a little less stressful.",A dream

The little meditation programs are nice, and the guided stretching has been really enjoyable. Plus, the interface has really lovely art!  The addition of stories in the new update is wonderful, as well as the new ASMR sounds (though I’ll always be greedy and want more!). The great thing is I feel like the developers seem to read feedback, and take it seriously. It’s a great app, and the updates continuously improve the experience.","Sound Stories, and Sound Asleep"
5,2018-07-21 07:21:42,"I love this app- it so nice to fall asleep to, whether my mind needs distraction or just a soothing sound, there's so many to choose from. Plus, I love the fact that you can mix and match different sounds, as well as change the volumes on each to emphasize which ones you want. Also, they have a timer you can set for bed that will turn off the music/sound after a pre-set time period, which is pretty nifty. There's are tons of other bonus features that I haven't even explored yet that Is like to try.  I've recommended this app to everyone!",Such a great app!
5,2018-04-22 14:23:18,"I’ve had this app for my MacBook for the longest time and had no idea that it was available for iPhone as well. I’m already familiar with the app and I loved using it on my laptop. However, now that I know I can use it on my phone, it’s even more convenient. I can sleep with it without the bright light from my computer and the phone app even offers a timer so that you don’t have to worry about running the app all night. There are so many sounds to choose from. Most of them are free, but the package def adds a lot more. I absolutely love it! Best relaxation app everrrrrrr!!!",Best Relaxation App Ever!

The sounds are great and the fact that you can mix them together and adjust the volume for each sound is fantastic, but I am especially excited about trying the meditations. I started listening to a few of them and really like the voice they chose. I’m hoping that when I wake in the middle the night this will help me get back to sleep. Super excited to continue exploring this app.",Awesome app!
5,2023-02-14 02:07:57,"I’ve used this app for several years, back when it was the binaural beats and a few sounds. I purchased a lifetime member ship, and for years, it has been my go-to to relax. I’ve really needed it often for super-stressful situations at a horrible corporate job and for all the stress during early 2020.   I’ve really enjoyed the fascinating stories and hypnosis sessions they’ve added through the years.   It’s also really versatile. I play binaural beats and soothing sounds with an audiobook or podcast. At night, I like to drift to sleep listening to binaural beats and relaxing music along with an audible Libby audiobook.   When I travel, I use various background noises to replace the fan I would use at home to mask my tinnitus.   Every time I’ve contacted support, BetterSleep has responded withing a couple of hours with solutions. They recently fixed a bug I reported within a couple of weeks.","Effective, versatile, and well-supported!"
4,2017-12-15 06:30:22,I truly love this app and the different sounds it has to offer. They are very realistic and it has a large number of sounds to choose from. Plus you have the option to include meditation and subliminal sounds in as well.  However I do prefer the sounds available on the iPad version verses the iPhone app. The iPhone app does not have as many sounds. I also don't like the fact that the apps are not interchangeable from different electronics. I paid for the upgraded app on my iPad but it did not carry over to my phone. And I got a new iPad and my original purchase did not transfer over either. Very disappointing.,Relaxation apps
2,2023-05-31 17:25:03,"I want to love this app - it has some amazing sounds and I love being able to make my own mixes. But the sounds only play for a few hours and then it goes silent, so every time I wake up in the middle of the night, I have to fumble to turn it back on at least twice more if I’m trying to sleep 8 hours. Why?! There isn’t any reason these shouldn’t play for 8 or more hours. I’ve even used the timer, hoping that is the issue but nope, no luck. I’ve scoured websites and the app hoping it’s just a free trial glitch or I’m somehow missing how to extend it but have had zero success. Why would I waste money on an app that puts me to sleep but isn’t particularly interested in keeping me asleep.",Extremely Frustrated
5,2023-01-13 10:38:28,"This app is one of those things that knocks you completely out! You pick which sounds you like ( you can completely mix and match several at once) and there’s even an option to have the sound adjust itself. You get an alarm, sleep recorder (it labels the recordings too [such as traffic, snoring, baby crying, etc.]) and sleep sounds/music for FREE.

Rainbow hypnosis has really worked to help me sleep since I’ve been doing it often. The only thing I think needs to be changed on this app is that people who do not wish to pay for more, like me, should have more things to do. I moticed that since I did not pay for the full package, I only got one or two activities per catagory. Thank you for your time and consideration.",This really works!

She then replied, “I guess he misses his white noise machine?” Me I blew it off until waking him up the following morning. I’d then asked him what app this was? His response was oh it was the app you had on your phone. Hahaha now I cannot live without it. Thunder is my favorite, I just added the flute, and music box. All I did was laugh. So now it’s back on my phone hooked up to my google speaker.",Love love love love
1,2022-06-06 07:17:43,"I got this app and shelled out $40 so that I can record my sleep. I wake up and it ends as normal just to get no information or record about my night’s sleep. Doesnt even pop up in the journal or anything. So what was the freaking point? Now I have to wait until the next night just to see if it hopefully works? How about you make sure it works the first time so that I can avoid this? ***Update*** I figured out the problem for you. If you have an alarm set and it goes off while it’s “tracking” it’ll interrupt the recording and basically delete the entire night’s data. Only issue is I NEED a separate alarm thats loud enough to wake me, so please fix this app so that it doesnt delete 8 hours worth of data just from me waking up to my clock’s alarm.",Doesnt Work

They also have ready made mixes and even those you can control each element to your liking. They are many other features like storytelling, wavelengths, and relaxation techniques that you get in this app that makes it such a great sleep companion. I use it nightly with myself and my kids. It comes us right down and allows us to fall into a deep slumber. Totally recommend. Give it a try, I think you’d love it too!",Wow
5,2021-02-12 03:07:04,"This helps a LOT with my anxiety. I put it on every night. All the different sounds are fun and relaxing to listen to. Im younger, and chose to get the premium of this then in game cash on a game. Thats saying how good it it. Anyways, I do a thing where I think something bad will happen (literally anything) dont know the name for it, but maybe could you add a meditation for that? If not, I understand because this is a very in depth app. It takes a lot of work to make, I bet. Huh I wonder what my user is, probably something embarrassing right?",This is a really great app!
5,2020-03-14 03:00:17,"I certainly use apps everyday but I’ve never been intensely stirred to write a review...until now!  THIS APP IS A GAME CHANGER!  My baby loves some good white noise to fall asleep but it was getting old! My friend said she used this to calm herself and left for her newborn and it worked like a charm so I gave it a go. My baby boy was asleep in 7 minutes flat.  I love all the sounds you get in the free version. The coolest part is that you can mix your own melody! So unique! We made our perfect mix and we enjoy it.   We have been using consistently for a month and now our baby hears the start up tune, lays his head down and is out sometimes within 3 minutes!   Needless to say, I had to share with my 2 girlfriends who are new moms and they both thanked me a few days later because the app was so helpful with their little ones.  So THANK YOU to the developer!!! This app is a joy to use and I hope you are rewarded for making such a great tool!",YOU NEED THIS FOR YOUR BABY!!! And you!
4,2020-05-15 00:42:24,"I love this app...I love it a lot. I use it everyday to listen to relaxing fire and water sounds and it helps me sleep and just feel happy. HOWEVER, one of my favorite things about it was that its sounds could play SIMULTANEOUSLY with other app’s audios I had playing (like my music app). It no longer can play simultaneously with other audios on my phone which is super disappointing. I loved that the relaxing sounds were in the background of my fave songs/music or an interesting podcast I’m listening to...if Ipnos can, please bring that feature back. :,) 4/5 stars without that feature but 5/5 with that feature.","Relaxing and heavenly, however..!"
4,2019-09-20 17:11:36,"I love this app and have used it every night for years, but the newest version removed the timer option to turn off the sounds at a designated clock time and reverted to an earlier version that is strictly passage-of-time-based. Is it too much to ask to have both options? Sometimes I might want the sounds to turn off after a 30 minute nap, but every morning I want the app to turn off at the same time. This means that every night I have to calculate how much time will elapse before I want the app to turn off instead of just choosing what time it should turn off.",Bring back the clock-based timer!
4,2019-05-18 03:37:05,"I love this app. I use the free version. I love the fact that you can save which sleep sounds work best for you. Over the last 5-6 months I have created 5+ sounds that work great for me depending on my mood. I opened the app today to find it updated. And when it did so, it deleted all of my saved times, alarms and sleep sounds. Almost 6 months of trial and error gone. Not to mention the life time was pro membership was $20 and now it’s $20 a year and $99 for the lifetime and from what I can see there is little difference from the pro version they had a week ago to the pro version they have now.",Love it but a little peeved

All the different sounds that are in this 1 app, it’s crazy!  There’s so many different and awesome sounds!  My favorite to put together are the frogs, crickets and cavern rain.

If I need to take a power nap or if I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back to sleep, I use the app. I set my sound of choice, usually zen, and set the timer to exit the app at either 20 mins or 2 hours later. Once the app turns off, for me anyway, I wake up and I always feel rested and much more alert.

I used to sit on my porch to listen to nature but I would always get flies in my drink and mosquito bites all over but now I can listen to nature anytime I want. I love how you can pick a mash of different sounds. The only thing is that they have a limit of how many sounds you can have playing at once but I fell like they should give us unlimited sounds played at once.

I sleep more deeply and wake up less frequently.

I get it, the company wants people to subscribe but every time I open this app it’s “Last chance!” And it’s really not a last chance.

I thoroughly enjoyed trying the sleep tracker feature and hearing what noises I made during the night, it brought me to tears from the laughter I had. I’ve only used it for one night and the sleep meditation I did was top tier, it put me to sleep so quickly.

Now it’s a bloated mess of an app that is focused on sleep management and locks all of the usefulness behind a $40 subscription model. Functionality (and previously “free” sounds) has been taken away to sell media and sleep monitoring. For example, previously I could put on a couple sounds and play my own music via another app (eg Apple Music), now that’s impossible because they want you to use their subscription music. Ick. Sad.

Most nights, I fall asleep before the end of the story. The only thing I would like to see changed ( for a 5* rating ) is the user interface. It is sometimes confusing, particularly when you think you have something all set up, ready to go, only to find the app resets to its Home Screen when you are ready to play a story or meditation.

And I can not access the mixes I spent hours curating. Just when I need them the most!  I have been back and forth with customer service about it for about six times already and it keeps happening.

There are so many sounds to choose from and you can edit the volume around just how you like it and save combinations you’ve made so you can fall asleep to the same thing every night if you want to, and this set it to turn off after some time. Even for panic attacks or meditation or literally anything this app is amazing, download it right now.",Perfectly calming

5,2021-05-14 01:00:51,Its a fantastic thing to use when trying to sleep i used it a few years back when dealing with anxiety and it was amazing... however as time has gone on and continued they started making it to where you have to buy certain things... i used to be able to use everything so its a little upsetting but i still use the soft melodies and other things that i can to fall asleep to. I give this a 4/5 star rating because it still gives you plenty of options.,My personal opinion
5,2020-08-22 07:13:52,"Love this app. So many sounds! Always helps my babies calm down.   (2020 Update) My kids have been falling asleep to a mix of sounds from this app for about 4 years. I use it to mediate and when I need to study. I absolutely love this app. I am considering actually purchasing the full version, not because I want to additional features, but just because I have relied on this app so heavily and it has always been helpful, and that is something worth supporting. Thank you, Relax Melodies team for continuing to provide a world class app experience.",One of my favorite apps of all time
5,2020-01-21 02:59:29,"I love this app so much and it helps me go to sleep so much faster. You can choose up to ten of your own sounds and they are all so soothing. There are also different specialties like stories and meditations. Another good thing about it is that you can set a timer so that you can fall asleep without having to worry about turning it off. It doesn’t have adds and there are some sounds and specialties that you have to have premium for,  but that doesn’t bother me. This is a great app and a 10/10 recommend to anyone who has trouble sleeping, or reliving stress!",Relax Melodies
5,2019-05-18 03:38:32,"This app has already made a HUGE difference in how quickly I have been able to fall asleep AND stay asleep! My husband has noticed an incredible difference in his sleep as well . He has PTSD and it’s been difficult to find anything that has helped him at night time, but just after two nights of using this app he has been able to stay asleep longer and feel more rested in the morning! We will be exploring more parts of this app over the next few days to see what other benefits we can get from it! Can’t wait! This app is AMAZING!",Amazing!
1,2019-10-23 10:38:12,"This app cost 60 per year. This does not include most of its features.  There is a endless amount of sounds but each must be unlocked by paying additionally on top of the yearly subscription. It is not clearly labeled that you do not have access to the modes, programs or cycles other than a small pad lock icon in the bottom of the desired program.  To access all of the features you must pay hundreds of dollars each year. If you try any program or sound you are automatically signed up for a 60 dollar yearly subscription unless you quickly manage your subscription and take it off.  For the features on this app you can find other apps that provide the same things for free or .99 and pay one time without the subscription.  THIS APP IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MONEY TO BURN.",Horrible Price
5,2018-08-01 09:18:31,This is a very good app to help you sleep you can make different combinations of the sounds till you find one you like. It also if good for meditation and is geared towards making you feel relaxed. And best of all ones you make a combination of sounds you like you can save it and make your own name for it so you don’t have to keep making it over and over again. It also has a sleep timer on it so if you listen to it before bed it will automatically shut off after a selective time you choose. I would recommend this app to anyone.,Relax Melodies
5,2018-06-19 02:15:17,"I love this app and all the sounds it features. Working with them and making my own combinations particularly helps my busy brain to sleep. Will definitely be buying the full version. I love the feature of listening to other people's ""mixes"" to find new sounds.  UPDATED: I did buy the full version and it is *fantastic*, especially with the new version of the app. More sounds, more options, new ""melodies,"" this is truly one of the apps I don't want to live without.

2,2018-03-25 14:41:13,"So when I first found this app, I really loved it. It was really enjoyable to mix my own melodies and create my own sounds. Everything was going fine, Until a couple days ago. I don’t know what’s happening but only some of my melodies won’t play… I can still listen to some of them that I’ve made fine. But others are completely unlistenable, it says it’s playing, but no sound is coming out of my phone. I have no idea why this is happening maybe there needs to be an update because I’ve tried to just restart the app a couple times and I’m still having the same problem.  Update: Everything is fine now lol  Update(again😑): again some of them are not working","Started out pretty good, I don’t know what’s happening now..."

You can adjust the intensity of the sounds and have multiple going at once. I'm just starting to use the app so there are features I haven't tried yet, but so far I love it. There is also the option to purchase additional sounds but there are so many available for free that you don't have to.

I am so sad by this. I do not want to switch apps but I may have to just do I have my white noise. Please fix so I can continue to use my favorite app. Update!!!

Because sometimes it is just too quiet or there is some wild animal making a noise making it difficult to fall asleep. We use this app to create the perfect for ambience wherever we happen to be sleeping. Whether it’s in the mountains of Eagle River, Valley, or on the waters of Prince William Sound here in our home in Alaska…we can always find the perfect mix of sounds, and music to create the perfect setting for us to fall asleep to.",My hubby and I LOVE this app!
5,2023-04-01 16:42:22,"I just started using this App and the very first thing I noticed is beautiful, high quality of all of the sounds whether it is music, white noise, narratives, etc. The crystal clear audio is truly amazing. As for sleep, I have only used it one night so I can’t report on that yet but so far, I am impressed with how much content that this App has. I have only scratched the surface on the variety of things there is to listen to, from stories to meditations to lovely music and more! Way more than a white noise App.",Quality of Sound
5,2021-04-11 09:57:00,I use it not just to sleep but when I need to calm my thoughts or emotions. I particularly like the cats purring and many other less common sounds are offered unlike many where there are like 5 styles. The mix of sounds offered is endless and the ability to make multiple custom “playlists” so I can have soundtracks of all the right sounds mixed just the right way for each of my children to help them fall asleep easier helps me so much so I can get my own much needed rest. The app doesn’t have to be on screen to hear the sounds either.,Soothing
5,2018-09-07 02:50:54,"So so impressed with this app and the amount that you have access to with the free trial. Such a gorgeous interface, ease of use is off the charts, and the features are exactly what I was searching hi and low for! You can set a timer for the sounds to turn off, you can set a bedtime reminder for each day, and you can save any custom sounds that you like to hear regularly! I cannot say more great things, and I’m the most tempted to pay for the pro version than any app has made me in a very long time! Download this and start falling asleep easier.",Quality AND quantity!

I’ve slept with music playing my entire life, so a sound machine was new to me and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. We are on vacation right now and guess what I forgot at home? Our bag with all of our chargers and the sound machine. 🤦🏻‍♀️ So I searched for apps and came across this one—and I love it! I created three melodies and I have gotten some pretty decent sleep the past two nights. I love the different sound options and the combinations are endless. This app has been perfect for what I need!",Slept great!
5,2018-05-24 09:06:07,Love being able to mix sounds and change volume lever for desired sounds. Can be applied for multiple uses but I primarily use it as a calming and soothing transition to get to sleep faster and helps me stay asleep better. I’m a veteran w/ PTSD and have had problems for years just trying to fall and stay asleep I wake up regardless but definitely feel that there is less time spent getting back to sleep. I would recommend this app for sure or at least give it a shot. Biggest thing is narrowing down what works for you personally.,Great for going to bed
5,2022-11-25 09:00:37,I’ve suffered from insomnia for a long time. I just can’t shut my brain off. I happened to stumble across this app while scrolling the App Store and decided to download it. Took me about 10 minutes to find my perfect combination of sounds. I put my earbuds in it was like I melted into the bed. I slept so good! I can’t get over how calming and peaceful it is. I love how many free options there are. It’s perfect for those of us who need peace and calm and don’t have a lot of extra spending money. Please never get rid of the free options!,Wonderful app!
4,2023-09-28 11:34:46,"I use this app quite often in the evening to drown out my husband’s snoring (just being real:)). It has so many ways to mix your own sound and I have found a really nice combination to help me sleep or go back to sleep if I wake up. I took one star off, however, because the frequency of ad pop-ups asking me to purchase the premium option EVERY time I open the app is almost enough to make me never use it again. I realize it’s a necessary evil to have subscribers but for the love please let me listen in peace at least half the time without this distraction!",Mostly great
4,2023-08-25 11:03:57,"I love the sounds variety and meditations. And I like being able to track my sleep. I appreciate the recent app update to allow sound tracks to play indefinitely during sleep tracking vs stopping at 3 hours!  Now the only update needed is to allow for a playlist to play while recording sleep. If I want to merge various sounds and a meditation on a playlist, I cannot then access the sleep recording function.  Once we enable playlists to play while tracking sleep, the app will be perfect!",Getting better with every update! Needs one more then perfect

Pros: lots and lots of different types of sounds. I really appreciate the variety and ability to layer.  Cons: where do i begin. If i pay (a good amount) for the upgraded version of an app then I expect several things. #1 stop bugging me multiple times a day to leave a review. When you have a screaming baby any popup is a hindrance and just annoying.  2# crashes a lot. If you accidentally open ig while this is on the sound glitches and sounds robotic and takes a few tries to restart 3# UX. I don’t know why the music tab is the first thing that pops up when you open the app. It should be me saved sounds. Multiple times now my hand has accidentally hit one of the featured sounds and started playing it. Not a problem normally, but a problem when you're trying to sleep a baby. I will be trying out the upgraded version of another app. If the service is mediocre i might come back out of desperation lol.",Pros: lots of features. Cons: crashes. Doesn’t leave you alone
5,2022-08-19 06:37:24,"I’ve used other devices and other apps but this has been my favorite! Lots of choices, customizable, and many extras!

They were able to immediately fix my glitch and  checked back with me to assure that I was satisfied.  There are so many options that there is literally something for everyone.  You just have to try it and you’ll be hooked too!",Best Sleep Sounds!

I recently inquired about a ‘speed’ feature since a lot of the music and sounds are lovely but sometimes a little too fast paced to fall asleep to and the apps team said they’d work on developing this feature!!

The sounds are great and calming, however, after the app made it so less sounds can be used without a subscription, it’s become sort of limited. All the sounds I use are under the free part of the app so it’s no issue to me, but i suppose it’s a mild inconvenience.

5,2020-12-31 09:22:27,I have been using this app for YEARS. I’ve had the all around 7-10 years now and I’ve loved it since then. I’m so pleased with the music snd meditation that was added. I get to sleep so well every night and I have a set noise that makes me so sleepy when I hear it. The only thing I would have to say that’s negative is the price for pro. I understand it takes money to keep an app like this going and that’s why I rated it 5 stars. It’s just hard to pay $60 or so a year as a college student during a pandemic. Overall though fantastic. Thank you so much.,The best
3,2020-09-04 11:04:08,"September 2020: app developer wrote, “…In our new version, the Docking station setting is now called Now Playing Widget!

Old review: Perfect if you have trouble falling asleep It's greatest advantage over other similar apps is that you build your own tracks by individually choosing sounds, controlling their individual volume and intensity.  Usually you have a bit of premixed ""meditation"" tracks to choose from. But maybe you don't like the occasional squawking bird. Tough cookies with other apps.

The available sounds in the free version give just enough to make a working mix to help relax or fall asleep.    I understand that money is needed to continue developing good products.   It would be nice to be able to “preview” these locked features first.  There seems to be much more locked than unlocked.  Also, the price is monthly instead of a one-time fee, so I would really want to see the quality of the rest of the locked ones before stepping into a monthly fee subsistions on an app.  Just me...",Nice app but...
3,2020-01-04 05:40:40,I paid for this app years ago when my kids was young. We went through multiple noise/sounds machine apps and this seemed like the one with the best quality and most useful sounds. However over this time the app has changed and a number of sounds that were originally included with my purchase now premium sounds that require an additional purchase. And my app also now has advertisements.   My guess is that somewhere/someone my paid app was incorrectly converted to a free version and I’m subject to the limited free feature set.   It’s too bad. I’d be careful praying for anything in this app in case it could happen to you.,Quality sounds but inconsistent value
5,2018-07-12 12:00:09,"The interface is so neat- I love this app! One of the biggest selections of very high quality sounds, and you can customize your own. There are very unique sounds that are unexpected as well. We plug into our Bose wave radio at night and turn on our customized rain combo and sleep like babies (probably because it drowns out our snoring, too!)

You won't regret it.","Just download it, already!"
4,2019-04-25 18:01:35,"I use this app at work as white noise to block out conversations around me. It’s absolutely great and allows me to concentrate much better.  Until I get a phone call. The app pauses just fine but even if I don’t answer the call, Relax stays paused, which means I have to go back in and start it up again. This is a little self-defeating, as I need to stop what I’m doing and manually restart. The whole idea of the app is to aim you towards a consistent mindset, but that’s broken at this point.  Would give five stars if it auto-played after a phone call like all other audio apps!","Good experience, works against itself a little"

And it’s hard for me to admit, but I love this app. It helps me sleep at night — my husband snores but it’s not at chainsaw levels typically. It’s usually just a noise that sticks out in silence. I would feel bad smacking him over what is probably nothing comparatively. And my upstairs neighbors are hippos with concrete shoes and no awareness. So, this won’t stop unusually loud noises from interrupting sleep, but the smaller ones disappear. Love it.",Begrudgingly Admit This Rules

The sounds will play ALL night while I sleep. I used to try to sleep to Pandora radio, but there were ads that played every two songs and it would startle me awake. Other white noise apps have a timer that shuts the sounds off after a while. The sounds in this app play forever, without interruption. Absolutely perfect. I also love that you can mix and match different sound effects.","Finally, an ACTUALLY free sleep app"

I have a terrible time falling asleep at night but these sounds help me fall asleep faster!! You can combine sounds into mixes and save them for later so you can come back to them and the app is just amazing!!

Some are at a pitch where they could give you a headache instead of helping you and maybe some of the sound qualities can be better. For example like to use the ocean sounds to help me sleep since I grew up on an island by the sea, but the sound for it just never feels right. But that may be just because I’m too attuned to the real thing that the track doesn’t satisfy it as the ocean sounds different depending on the tide.",Helpful

After 5, maybe 10 years, and lots of sleepless or hard to sleep nights I downloaded several sleep or mood apps, and this one was the best. No push for sign up or in app payments. The basic free version is amazing. I use it to fall asleep instead of watching tv, and I fall asleep faster. Just set the time and close my eyes. I think this is the first review for an app I wrote. It really changed and helped my life. If you can’t sleep, give this app a try.",Best sleep app ever
5,2019-06-27 19:18:42,"Relax Melodies has been a part of mine and my families lives for over six years now . And may I say that times we’ve tried to sleep without it we don’t get good sleep at all . Our sleep in important and so this app has in a sense  become a part of our family’s life !Were always so much happier and energetic waking up from a great nights sleep with Relax Melodies . I highly recommend this app to anyone trying to help children sleep or anyone simply trying to get better sleep at night . Rest well everyone,  The Gonzalez Family",Highly recommended !
5,2018-12-01 05:11:15,"I had troubles sleeping lately due to stress and my mind filled with stuff, as soon as I turned on a few sounds from this app for 2 hours a night to sleep to, it works instantly for me. Ive never slept better and I've even gotten a few lucid dreams from it! The only bad side id say about this app is the payments you have to make to get extra sounds to sleep to, which isn't a big deal to me, i’m happy enough to listen to the sounds you get from buying nothing for this app. If you have hard times sleeping, I highly recommend this app to use!",LOVE IT
5,2018-09-27 02:34:47,"I have always been the type to need complete dark and silence to sleep, but on the days when my brain won’t turn off this app is the only thing that helps. Reading, tv, classical music - they all end up keeping me up for hours. Nature sounds and I end up having to go to the bathroom just as I’m falling asleep. But with this app I can choose from a variety or even play multiple at once to create my own mix. And with the timer feature I can set it up to turn itself off so it’s not going all night. Just what I needed.",Perfect mix
5,2018-07-03 19:44:49,"I love and use this app so much I actually bought the upgrade. It has all the features I want from a sound machine app including adding any combination of sounds, individually adjusting levels, and saving your fave sets. The only features I thought it was missing was being able to adjust volumes of all selected sounds on one screen and sorting sounds by type, but I recently found those, so either there was an update or I just finally looked for them. Makes sleeping much easier!","High quality sounds, easy to use and configure"
5,2018-05-16 03:55:13,"I absolutely love the selection of sounds they have. It ranges from just white noise type sounds to actual soothing melodies. The fact that you can combine whatever sounds you want, from nature to urban, it’s what I like most. You can save mixes you make and adjust the volume per sound which is so nice. My favorite part is that there is a timer that shuts off the app. I’m able to put it on long enough for me to fall asleep but not be on all night. I highly recommend this to anyone that needs calm sounds in their life.",Best app to use before bed
4,2018-05-26 02:43:08,"One night I was having a particular hard time because I could not sleep. I have tinnitus and sometimes the sound is deafening . One night when my ears were roaring I remembered I had this ap. It took awhile finding what I wanted, but I found the frogs. I grew up in a farming community and it sounded so soothing to hear the frogs. I tried a couple of other sounds and stopped immediately when I heard the train. When I was growing up we had train tracks that ran through the Country and the sound I heard was almost exact. So times when my ears begin to ring I turn on the frogs and train and fall asleep.",Title. Stopping the ringing.
4,2018-05-17 08:39:30,"I love this app and recommend it to my friends and family all the time when they talk about having trouble falling asleep. The 15 minute scab through your body meditation knocks me out every time. I think I’ve only made it through the whole progression 1 or 2 times without passing out. The multitude of options for different sounds and volumes is fantastic too. The “Monk Chant” sound is a dark horse for best sound on the app.  All this said, I’m not a fan of the most recent update for ios11. I’m not a fan particularly of the new interface for selecting the meditations. As someone that uses the app EVERY night, I’m not a fan of the change.   Additionally, the app seems to be crashing on me within a few minutes of the body scan meditation. All sounds and meditation walk through a stop suddenly and I have to restart the app. Not exactly what you want when you’re trying to sleep.  If these bug fixes can be remedied I think this is absolutely a 5 Star app.",Wish I was giving a 5
5,2018-05-12 16:39:10,I am a new mom of twins and sleep is a valuable thing around here!  This app not only helped me fall asleep faster but also my daughters were able to settle in easier with the calming sounds.   I upgraded to the lifetime subscription and do not regret one penny of it.   If you like to fall asleep to various sounds get this because you can also layer different sounds together making it even more relaxing.   Do yourself a favor - don't wait get this now it will do wonders for your sleep and overall relaxation times during the day!,Beat app I ever bought!!
5,2023-04-10 00:26:47,"There are SO many sounds to choose from in the premium version! Love experimenting with brainwave sounds and the intro to sleep hypnosis. I fell asleep listening to it in the dark, which hasn’t happened in a long time. (Braking pattern of using tv while I sleep) Also I contacted support with questions a couple times and they are quick to respond (even late at night) and answer every question. Very happy so far and will continue using this app on my journey to better sleep :)",Lots of content & great support
5,2023-02-17 17:14:53,"I've been listening to frequencies / healing tones for awhile on YT, but this app is soooo much better! I can track my sleep, and most importantly adjust the volume of each noise, layer noises, and create my own noise to study or relax to. I absolutely love this app and I always have it running, whether it be to focus/concentrate for school, to relax and unwind after classes, or to meditate to a healing frequency with. Highly, highly recommend for anyone who struggles with mental health. It has done a lot for me already and i'm so grateful.",Helps focus / ADHD/neurodivergence!
5,2022-11-23 06:15:00,"I’ve been using this for about 6-7 years, and it is absolutely amazing. Even while using just the free stuff, I’ve created several mixes to listen to while I sleep and have been getting much better sleep because of it. It takes a lot of trial and error at first, and it is definitely designed to just help you relax don’t let me pursued you otherwise. However, no matter what the reason I heavily suggest getting it as it truly works if you find what is best for you.",Satisfyied Sleep Summary
5,2022-03-11 07:22:47,We have used this app since my daughter was born six years ago. I finally broke down and bought the subscription 2 years ago and have not been disappointed. I have it in my iPad and phone and made my husband get it too. My favorites are the stores. Aster had to be my favorite narrator 💜 the only down side is I constantly get logged out and have to “restore my purchase” almost every night. Other than that I love it and we really can’t sleep without it.,Cannot sleep without
5,2021-12-03 06:33:22,"I like the natural sounds of relax melodies and fantastic customization of choosing your own blend of sounds. Additionally, I really like that I’ve been able to play this app in airplane mode vs. a majority of meditation apps seem to only be usable when you’re connected to Wi-Fi (which is frustrating if you’re trying to sleep and you get alerts from other things if you’re still connected to Wi-Fi) so, this is a better choice than other apps.",Natural customizable sounds & worked in airplane mode
5,2021-09-23 04:21:54,You guys have really upgraded the app in the best way. I’ve been using this for years!! I think since I was in middle school & I just recently finished high school. I’ve suffered from anxiety and everyone knows the rain sounds on relax Melodie’s calms me. This is my GO TO. I play the sounds at night or when I feel anxious. I was so happy when I saw there were bedtime stories added.  It’s all so calming. I’m very thankful & planning on purchasing the yearly subscription. I have tried other apps but nothing beats relax Melodies .,Love for years.
5,2021-01-14 19:03:43,"I have to say that I am so grateful that this app was created.  This app has several binaural beats (although personally, I only use the deep sleep one), and along with some music in the background (specific to induce sleep, for my choice), I can then add a story to listen to.  And, I can even take the binaural beats and music background and even listen to a story in another app...amazing!  I haven’t found any other apps that can do that while having their own stories.   I love just how customizable this app is.   Perfect. Thank you, developers.",I am grateful for this app
2,2021-05-13 01:59:18,"What’s the point of the app if I can only listen to four stories(!),a third of the sounds, and three things of music!                   Of course there is a handfull of meditations, but there is like two that actually work for me! And this I find very surprising as meditations don’t really work on me!                                                                         I’d move it up to four or five stars if this is fixed but for now no!!  An update:)( I really like the most recent update! I can search for a certain narrator, how long, what type, but however(!),still(!) I have the same amount of things to listen too!!!!👺😾🙄🤬😡😤😠😫 And nothing is being done about it!! No fair!! :(((",What’s the point?
4,2021-05-10 01:38:19,Oh get that they need to make money somehow but I just wish they would open up more meditations and stories for the people who are young and don’t have money or a job yet or the people who just can’t afford to pay that money for good stories. Like me I’m not even a teenager yet and can’t fall asleep so I use the app but I’m kinda tiered of listening to the same stories or meditation every night. Just consider what I said because I think you would have a lot more people get the app if you open up more for free (without free trial).,Unlock more free stuff otherwise love the app
5,2020-06-18 23:12:55,"This app completely alleviated my symptoms of tinnitus and trauma and allowed me to not suffer through them especially at night. I have this app all day and night.

I am thankful for the creativity and work that’s been put in this app, it is truly a necessity for me to have as it calms me, and alleviates my symptoms.

1,2020-09-25 15:31:21,I paid for the premium version of this app a few years ago and now it’s subscription based ??  Developers should not be allowed to change a product  and the terms of use once they’ve sold it to people.  You should have offered this drastically revised app as a new product if you’re now making it a subscription based service like satellite radio service.  This should be illegal to take away something you’ve already sold.  Why nickel and dime people to death for some pre-recorded sounds and make us pay a hefty price each year.  I want my old version back that I paid for not locked version that requires a payment for each sound or having to pay each year.  This shouldn’t be like streaming or satellite radio service.,I purchased this app years ago
5,2020-01-09 08:05:09,"My parents tend to be awake before I am and usually aren’t quite when doing things around the house. I used to wake up everyday during the summer to my mom putting away the dishes because it was so loud. Now, all I have to do is pop in my earbuds and put on white noise from this app and I don’t hear a thing. I also have misophonia (basically the hatred of certain sounds) and whenever I hear a sound I don’t like I can opt to use this app and I never hear a thing and it keeps me calm. I really really enjoy this app and highly recommend it.",Amazing
5,2018-10-02 15:10:18,"A friend told me about Relax Melodies after hearing that I have been struggling with falling asleep after the very tragic passing of my husband. I am being completely honest in saying that it worked THE VERY 1st NIGHT that I tried it! I was asleep before the 15 min meditation was over every time! Now I set the timer for 20 mins and fall asleep to the thunder and rainstorm! And I stay asleep!! Thank you for this wonderful, and very effective app!! My heart is still broken into a million pieces but at least I am sleeping at night...and that makes me feel just a little better!",FINALLY...SLEEP!

It’s so hot and the battery is completely drained.. and I have no other apps open and the screen was off the whole time. I don’t know why it’s overheating my phone when it never did before. I was going to buy the annual pass but now I can’t trust it. I don’t know why it’s doing this. And the app will stop playing sounds when it gets to overheating.. phone is not plugged in and phone is BRAND NEW. Absolutely no issues with any other app and it has never overheated with anything else or even gotten warm. Please address and fix. I love this app and rely on it so much with my newborn.",Overheating phone
4,2018-11-07 03:41:03,"I love this app!!It is super relaxing and has so many sounds that help calm me.😌 If I ever have trouble sleeping, I just turn to my phone and play my sounds.😌 I love the idea of being able to play as many sounds as you want, as well as adjusting the sounds and making your own playlists🤗 But one improvement I wish was made is maybe more sounds? There are many sounds but I’d just like the idea of others; one idea is summer night. Now idk if it’s just me but the night in the summer is definitely different that night time in other seasons. 😂 Anyway I love this app and it’s highly recommended👌🏻",Relaxing!!
5,2018-08-16 03:34:38,"This app kinda blew me away. It’s so simple, yet there is so much more to it than at first glance. I payed to unlock all the features and I’m so glad I did. The guided meditation is pretty awesome. There are so many options and you can add your custom sound mixes to play in the background of any meditation. I use this app every night now and there is always a sound or mix to fit my mood.  I struggle with chronic pain, nausea, anxiety, and insomnia, and this app is definitely helping me deal with all of those.  This app is worth paying to unlock all the features.",Seriously worth it
4,2018-08-25 04:24:10,"I find this kind of sound and music helps prepare me to sleep. This app provides that marvelously. I’m reviewing this in my second day owning it, but I am still learning how to choose and use.  I bought the version, not so much because I wanted extra sounds or music, but to avoid ads. Am working on some of the meditation techniques. Nothing new here, but sometimes useful to hear. But it stayed on all night and worked down the battery. Have to get the timer to work better. It doesn’t seem intuitive, or else I was too relaxed!","Provides the relaxing music and sounds, but can be a little distracting"
5,2018-06-27 04:00:07,I struggled to find a blend with music and nature sounds that was a good fit for me. I would find done had birds that were distracting to me and others the music would hit a night that I would just focus on. Part of my need for sleep sounds and that I need a distraction for my mind to let go and fall asleep. This is perfect!!!!!!!!!! I have the seaside with a slow wave and my delicate music and I can customize and determine which is the main sound focus. I could not be happier. I also love the alarms to get ready for bed. It is a great way to get a healthy sleep routine.,It’s perfect!!
5,2018-05-22 03:06:30,I love this app! I have it on every device. It helps my kids fall and stay asleep. So many combinations of sounds!  The sound not only relaxes them but also blocks and drowns out other sounds- so when my kids are sleeping I don't have to tip toe trying not to wake them. I have used it with both kids since they were new borns and my oldest is 3... Still using it! Update: my oldest is now almost 7... but I still use this app every night for ME!!!  I love having a white noise in the background and drowning out any nighttime noises or husband snoring 😆,A MUST HAVE! Esp. For babies.
5,2023-08-03 11:49:12,I have had issues sleeping for pretty much my whole adult life due to being a little sleeper however as I’ve gotten older now it’s very hard to fall asleep without tuns of OTC meds. I finally tried this sleep app and I love it. It actually helped me fall asleep with hardly any medicine. I listen to the sleep meditation for 15 minutes which goes through your whole body as you breathe in and out and I release all my anxiety and stress and I actually fall asleep quick. I kid you not it’s amazing. :),Finally help for sleep
5,2023-03-31 13:53:06,"Normally, would not pay so much money for an app, but I figured it’s like going out to eat twice. I already don’t do that. I have tried to sleep tracker and it’s very interesting to hear noises at night. I did not realize how much I was waking up. Some of the meditations are really good. My children have a listening to the kids stories. I would hope they would add some more because we have run through the all of them so far.  I like making my own mix of sleep sounds.","So far, with the $"

There are so many great stories, but the average time is 20 minutes. Sometimes I can’t get to sleep that fast.   Secondly, I wish they would come out with new stories/meditations/music more often. I use this app every night and sometimes get bored with the lack of new options.   Overall a great app. I especially enjoy making my own mixes depending on my mood. Would be an even better with some minor adjustments.","It’s great, but…."

My life turned upside down when I went to a first shift job while my fiancé stayed on his first shift. I was now sleeping alone in the dark tossing (and of course) turning. I wanted to try this app and I’m SO glad I did! The sleep stories especially put me to sleep within 5 min. I feel warm, comfortable, and just content. I’m not scared, and I’m finally feeling rested. While it may be a tad expensive I may just buy the full version and continue to sleep uninterupted.",Insomniac to bedhead
3,2023-03-08 11:51:50,The app is so calming I love the look of it and the design but I downloaded this for the sleep stories and there’s like less than 20 total. Also I love the underwater city but I only see the first part and the holiday one which at the start says “welcome to part 5” where are the rest? If you want to use this for falling asleep to music or sounds you’ll probably love it but there just aren’t many stories which is what I thought was the main content. Lastly it’s way too expensive. I think every person would rather pay a small monthly amount over $60 for a year,Peaceful app but needs way more content
5,2020-04-08 18:25:31,"If you have trouble falling asleep or you have a baby who won’t quit screaming due to exhaustion, I definitely recommend this app 👏🏻 I’ve had it since about 5 months before I had my son and since the day I’ve bought it, it has exceeded my expectations 😍 it has a wide variety of music and sounds, you can combine sounds together, and you can save sounds for later. Some sounds are locked unless you get the premium subscription but there are a ton that are free to listen to ❤️ I highly recommend this app!",Highly Recommend‼️
5,2018-10-22 21:06:58,It works and it’s very easy to use!  Nice interface with simplicity built into it.  I’ve been using this frequently for sleeping while using an eye cover.  I love the multiple tracks with up to 12 controlled sounds (more would be nice).  Would be cool if they add some kind of visual representation of all the sounds playing together although you’ll probably only see it for a few seconds since you’ll fall asleep.  I wish I had this app when my daughter was born for her to sleep!  Would have been a huge help for all of us.,I love this app! ❤️
5,2018-08-15 03:54:29,"I have a hard time falling asleep sometimes, and it happens for days on end when this occurs. I love how the sounds/melodies in this app really just help to calm yourself and allow you to relax so you can sleep. I haven't had a bad sleep cycle since starting to use this! (Okay, it's not foolproof, BUT I'm losing one night of sleep every now and then instead of ten) Plus, the fact that you get plenty of sounds to use without having to pay for anything is what made me love this.

5,2018-07-10 06:53:39,"This app has been a favorite for me for years. My husband bought the full version on his device and while we have used it and love the additional features, the free version is more than enough for my use. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because they have updated it consistently and added new sounds to play around with, but I do have to manually click on and off each sound if they aren’t preset.

I was having trouble sleeping when I searched for an app to help and found this. I have been experimenting with different sounds and have slept better in the last few nights than I have in some time. I’ve found a new “normal”. I will likely be upgrading to the Pro version in the near future and am excited to try all of the different features. Definitely recommend.,Better than expected

2,2023-10-25 13:59:28,"This app was the greatest. Simple. Just pick your sounds, throw on a timer, sleep, app shuts down after the timer is up. Awesome. Exactly what I wanted. Now- they made a ton of the sounds I loved premium (I had a set of sounds my body was absolutely attuned to. Like sleep within minutes of hearing them and now I have to pay for them). It’s always trying to “track” my sleep, even when I don’t select to have it do so (so listening to me while I sleep, not creepy at all), and it takes over my phone and Apple Watch. Only shuts off if I kill the app. Not happy. Thinking I’m going to start searching for a new app. Wish we could go back to relax melodies.",I used to love this app…
5,2022-10-23 02:53:18,"I bought this app when it first came out. I purchased a lifetime subscription. I am so thankful for stumbling across it when I did. They charge a fair amount more now however I believe it’s well worth the price. There are many more features and sounds now, so many I didn’t even use them all. I sleep so deep when I use the brainwave features in combination with ambient sounds and noise. This app also helps me calm alcohol cravings and increases my focus. Five star app for sure.",Been loving this app for 8 years
5,2022-05-03 05:06:58,"I got this app because my tinnitus was waking me up at night. Works great to solve that problem, but I’m also having fun making sound mixes and I like hearing the mixes that other people make too. So easy to drift off to sleep or even read when I have this going in the background. Stays in while I’m surfing other apps or looking at stuff online, emails, etc, which I like.

1,2022-08-02 18:07:56,"I use this app for one thing and one thing only: to have a gentle alarm to wake up to. I got this app back when it was Relax Melodies and it was great then. Now it has become bloated with unnecessary features that I neither use nor care about and the functionality of the one feature that I do use has been progressively reduced. I can no longer create multiple alarms with different sounds and can only edit the one available alarm when it is actually on. There is no longer even a way to get to the alarm quickly from the home screen - I have to go through a secondary menu. I will be looking for a better alarm app, because this one has been meddled with so much that it is garbage now.",Used to be a good app...

So I used this app and it’s actually helped me a lot and I’m getting more sleep in. So I just want to thank the creators who made this app. But all the sounds are a bit expensive and most of them are money, but I won’t complain.

I needed something to fill a void in my life and this app filled the sound. Which was a void at the time. I’m probably a one-off but it might have saved my life. It fills the room with peaceful sounds without draining the battery. And even more importantly, it’s free and customizable.

Over the years the developer has updated regularly and is very responsive to comments and suggestions. The wide variety of sounds, meditations, music, and stories are top notch with mix possibilities that are endless. The user interface is gorgeous and very easy to navigate. There are similar apps to choose from, but this is the best of its kind. Two big thumbs up!!!",Highly Recommend!!!

Now that I've done that, I love the new sounds, but I don't know why I had to reinstall. Lately I've really enjoyed the meditations. They help me fall asleep. You should definitely try them.

If you want you can get it in the App Store! I just want to bless the people that made Relax Melodies! I love blessing very or just good people, even mean, rude anything else I will still bless them. I’m so glad that these people were or are born do you know what I mean? And who ever’s reading this...........................please just know you’re blessed no matter what, ok!

4,2021-07-18 07:15:48,"ive been using this app since i was about 12, im 17 now, and its helped me sleep to white noise for a while now. ive had a bit of insomnia and issues with misophonia and having a constant sound running helped me sleep through the night.   i do plan on breaking away from this habit, but it really does help and i do recommend it to anyone troubled by sounds that interrupt their sleep and cant have a fan going throughout the night.   A lot of sounds are free, and no matter what you choose, any are perfect. getting premium isnt really worth it, you just get a wider selection of sounds and able to combine more.   No this is not a paid review, this is a genuine review by a random 17 year old who has issues with sleeping because id rather spend my time crying in bed and watching tiktok as my only source of entertainment because the real world doesnt entice me whatsoever.  i do recommend it, really do- your local alphabet mafia",genuine review
2,2020-09-02 10:47:30,"I have used this app for years for background noise while sleeping, and it has always been great. Since the latest update, though, it has started repeatedly shutting itself off for no apparent reason. This has happened a handful of times over the years and has always been easily fixable by rebooting the app, but no more. After updating, I woke up to silence in the middle of the night, so I rebooted the app and went back to sleep. Shortly after, I woke up to silence again. I restarted both my phone and the app and went back to sleep. Half an hour later, I woke up to silence again. I don’t know what changed in this latest version of the app, but I’m disappointed.",Indispensable until recently
3,2019-10-22 02:52:32,"There are a lot of different sounds. They’re separated by type of sound or can be viewed all together. There are also variations of some sounds. (Think; rain, heavy rain, storm.) I will say that I’m surprised that nothing else is free. I was hoping some of the other parts of the app would be available on the free version. (There is meditation, exercises, stretches, and tons more sounds.)  Overall, I’ll keep using it for now. The organization of the app is great and it’s easy to use. I like being able to mix and make combinations of multiple sounds. The sounds themselves seem to be better than the last app I tried so that is also a plus.",Pretty good
5,2018-10-09 01:10:47,"I can’t say this enough.  This app is freaking amazing.    I don’t do meditation.   I can’t sit still. Just not my thing.    2 weeks ago I did the meditation thru this app. The ones for sleep. I feel out before it could finish.  Thought it was just beginners luck but each time I use it ... same thing happens.  If u can’t sleep. Try it.   Also this has the best sounds. All kinds of options wrapped into one app.   I use this every night.       Love it love it love it.   Now, if it could just make my husband roll over when he snores........",Dreaming and sleeping
5,2018-08-18 07:46:32,"I've had this app for years. I suffer from clinical insomnia, basically because I can get my brain to shut off. I've been prescribed medication, which I wasn't fond of. I've also tried different brands of sleep aids, which are alright. This app, on the other hand, is the best. It gives my brain soothing sounds to focus on, instead of being trapped in my own thoughts, going crazy because I can't sleep. I love that they recently added a timer, so it turns off while I'm asleep! Great app, I don't know what I'd do without it!",The reason I can sleep at night.
5,2018-07-27 06:54:04,"I’ve been using this app for years and am just now reveiwing. There is nothing better when you need to fall asleep quickly or take a 5 minute break. There is a HUGE diversity of sounds so you’re sure to find something that strikes a chord. For instance, there is a rain on tin roof sound (this in the FREE section, mind you!!!) that takes me back to rainy days at my grandmother’s house. Would recommend this app above all similar apps. Use it probably once a week at least for the last two+years, maybe more.",Wonderful for a Break or Sleep
5,2018-07-19 06:21:47,"Honestly, this app is great. What sounds/instrumentals they offer are amazing and the amount they have for free is totally worth downloading for. I use it when I need “noise” but not music..if you know what I mean. Great for relaxing, going to sleep to or studying. The best feature is the ability to layer sounds so you can create a unique sound that fits what you’re looking for. Hell sometimes I just put it on add some chill sounds to my music (I play it on another device). Overall, good app if you’re looking for easy ambience. Recommend","Relaxing, Worth Downloading"
5,2018-06-10 04:00:47,This app definitely helps me on a daily basis through multiple tasks. Our use it before I go to bed I use it when I take a bath or use it when I just want to simply relax. Or use it on my drive home from work to decompress it is such a great tool to use. I even use it for my children before they go to bed. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone. It’s put in a deeper sleep on you can customize it to whatever you like.  Thank you to the creators of this app  Cale and Kelsey in Arizona,"Bed time, relax time, bath time and all the time"
5,2018-02-10 04:55:26,"After just minutes of downloading the app, I was immediately impressed with the layout and controls. I like that you can layer different sounds and each sound has its own volume control. So, if you just want a slight touch of one sound and make another one louder, you can do that. I did purchase the premium sounds and I think it was worth the cost. I have used it every night since I downloaded it. Only thing I don’t like is you cannot alphabetize the sounds or move them around to make your own groupings.",Great app
5,2023-05-25 12:42:25,"At night, as I go to sleep, my mind spirals into obsessive anxiety loops. The sleep stories and meditations really help me turn my brain off. And the sleep sounds help for when my husband snores. I listen using sleep headphones (which are fairly comfortable and fairly inexpensive) so that it doesn’t disturb him. I highly recommend this for people with anxiety insomnia, and it’s worth the money to upgrade. Sleep is so important to health, and there are some nights where I couldn’t get to sleep without this app.",This does the trick nicely
5,2022-04-01 16:01:17,"I’ve had the free version of this app for years, like back when it was JUST the sound tiles. I thought it was cool then, and it’s even better now. I gave the free trial a shot recently and was sold before the week ended. I mostly use the app for ambient sounds while I work, but I also enjoy making custom sound tile mixes to create soundscapes for when I’m reading - which is super cool since there’s enough sounds and adjustments to really set the stage for just about anything I’ve read so far.",Worth it!
4,2023-05-19 02:05:21,"I love this app! It’s better than some previous sleep apps that I’ve tried in the past.  The only thing I wish it had was an option to choose either a male or female voice. I tend to find male voices more soothing and are better when trying to fall asleep than with female voices. There are some meditations that look really great, and I’d like to try them, but haven’t because they are all in female voices. If there were an option to choose between two voices, I feel that I’d get way more out of the app.",Wish there were more voice options
5,2022-02-19 23:00:48,"Ive been using this app for well over 5 hrs and it never failed me yet, I use it every single night I sleep home and when I’m on the road I use it at the rest stop when on break. I use it to meditate in my own way with jus peace and quiet and my sounds… I jus wish even tho I’m using the free side that my saved sounds should still reach the community because I have some of the best that’ll help a grizzly bear stay sleep all year around. 😂 thanks for the greatest app of all time…",Best sleep app ever created
5,2021-06-30 07:16:50,Wish there was more meditations unlocked. But overall very good app and put me to sleep the first time I used it. Also being able to make your own background noice really helps. Some like the crackles of a burning fire while others love the raindrops splashing on the tops of their house/car. Love this app but again I wish there was more meditations unlocked. It kinda gets boring listening to the same ones over and over again. But for the fact it’s free is a total steal!!,Download this app NOWWW!!!!
5,2021-04-11 01:59:22,"Like so many other apps paying extra money makes the app better. Luckily this app is wonderful without paying anything! The free version works great! I don’t pay anything, but I still use it every night. It has great music, and you can make your own. The premium version isn’t much different. I think if you don’t want to pay anything it’s totally a good app for calming music. It even lets you listen to podcasts and meditation stations for free! I recommend it tremendously.",Relax Melodies is Great!
5,2020-08-24 03:12:39,"I love this app and even without paying, the app is amazing and great. Piano is a really good one for me, and it can certainly help all ages, and I would definitely use it for babies. And no ads! I love this app so much and have had for it for 5 years and more to come. I got premium and it is so worth it. No ads at all, and the sounds, mediations, and stories all play while your phone is turned off or you’re doing something else, and you can just pause it whenever. I truly recommend it, even without premium ❤️💕","Amazing, insomnia who?"
5,2020-03-19 04:01:24,"Relax melodies is one of the best apps I have. I use it to decompress after tough days, and I also even use it to sleep on nights were that snooze is elusive. I love the vast range of options for sounds and that you can save your own custom melodies. My favorite feature by far is the timer so I don’t have to worry about the sound continuing all night. I sometimes can’t believe this app is free well, mostly, unless you want even more options and sounds than are already provided. Love this app. Would gladly recommend it to everyone.",Great app
5,2020-03-01 14:48:24,I impulsively bought a lifetime subscription to this app in 2017 because I wanted to listen to their realistic cicada noises. I've used it consistanly since and they've continually updated it with new and interesting content. I now use the bedtime stories and the hypnosis to fall asleep often. I've used their breathing exercises to relax. And I've used just about every feature available on the app. It was definitely a good purchase. I know that the lifetime subscription is much more expensive now and I was lucky to get it as early as I did.,Very Helpful
5,2019-09-29 07:47:15,"I’m trying to cancel my subscription, but the app claims it “can’t connect to App Store” when I obviously can connect since I’m writing this review. After some digging I found a support email and I wrote an email, at which point I received a laundry list of requested information and a “click here to take you back to your email” which leads you down another rabbit hole. I’ll be interested to see how long ipnos takes to respond to my email. I do hope they resolve it quickly.",Difficult to Cancel Subscription during trial period
5,2019-08-08 06:07:55,"I’m away at college so it was super comforting to be able to mix various different rain and thunder sounds to replicate the rain falling outside my window at home. I love how it plays even if you exit the app or turn off your device. You can an even set an alarm in it! There’s a premium account that you can pay for, or you can be like me and listen to the wonderful variety free sounds! I’m listening to the rain right now and I feel like I can almost smell it, it’s that clear and real of a sound.",Wonderful sound quality!
5,2018-07-18 02:05:09,"This helps me so much especially when I'm on retreats or something and I'm in a room with lots of people. You see, I'm one of those people who actually like to sleep when I'm on trips and before this app I just had to suffer through the talking in my room and pray they would hush up soon. Now I can just put on the wind, river, and lullaby and I'm asleep in 10 minutes! It's great!  Also, the alarms are so much more peaceful to wake up to then the typical alarms on your phone. I personally wake up to birds and a light wind every morning 💛",Sleep! And a peaceful morning
5,2018-06-15 14:05:05,"I downloaded this so I could have some background noise while studying/reading, and was pleasantly surprised to find that there were plenty of sounds to mix and choose from that weren’t behind a pay wall. The loops seem long enough that you don’t feel like you’re listening to the same sound over and over, as I’ve found with some ambient sound apps. The timer function is also very useful when you’re trying to fall asleep, but don’t want to wake up to a dead phone.",Even the free version is great
5,2018-01-11 04:23:41,"All the sounds are very realistic and vivid. Doesn’t sound like a recording at all. I was shocked. It seriously feels, for example, if you chose light rain, that it is actually raining. You can add a lot of sounds together. My personal favorite is “rain” and “eternity”. The rain sounds like raindrops hitting a roof and eternity is just a melody that is very relaxing and peaceful. The melody does not drown out the rain and the rain does not drown out the melody. I have to say this is the best app. I highly recommend it for sure.",Absolutely Amazing. I sleep so much better when I use the app
4,2018-03-08 04:17:43,"I struggle to fall asleep without noise. I love the sounds and melodies that this app provides! Love this app!!  Update: the “distant train” sound is my favorite and really helps me fall asleep! However, that sound doesn’t work most of the time. I have closed the app and reopened it, I have deleted the app and reinstalled it, and I have tried restarting my phone. There is no rhyme or reason to when it works and doesn’t. It is very frustrating that the sounds I want aren’t working all the time.   Really hoping a bug fix comes soon! Going from 5 to 4 stars until this is fixed.",Perfect....well it was....
4,2018-01-19 04:45:19,"The sounds are great and because you can have several sounds going at once, it’s easy to create a very custom environment. For example: what might it sound like to swim in the vast gaseous oceans of Jupiter? Well, just tap the ‘Jupiter’ and ‘underwater’ icons and swim away! Can you imagine a purring cat during a great thunderstorm? The sound of a distant train while devout monks chant? Perhaps the sound of someone vacuuming in a bustling restaurant is your thing...it’s all here and it’s amazing! Plus, you can control the output level of each sound for limitless ambient possibilities. I highly recommend this app 👍🏼","Can’t live, if living is without you..."

Yet, from the day that I'd learned I could be, I had only one certainty and that was looking forward to a 10' meditation from this wonderful application. I would set my cell on airport mode, choose soothing sounds, normally always with water sounds, schedule fade away time, and choose the meditation that would coax me gentle to remembering to breath, and then glide into oneiric realms, with ease.

I couldn’t wait til morning to ask about it, afterwards I immediately downloaded the app and tested it out . I’ve tried the bed time stories and they relax me and put me on another level for drifting off to sleep calmly . The customizable music is amazing.

5,2021-11-04 05:27:06,Recently I’ve been having a hard time sleeping I’ll have my thoughts swirling around in my head and I can’t calm them so I downloaded this app and I soon found that when I mixed rain thunderstorms white noise and others it calmed my brain and those thought would be quite and id turn it off and I would fall asleep my only disappointment is that most of the other sounds cost an extension which I don’t want to buy but I’m happy with what I have thank you for calming my mind,My rating
1,2021-12-11 09:52:55,"This app used to be great, all sounds were unlocked and it was free. They rolled out an update that locked most of the sounds and they want you to pay to be able to use them. With the free version, I have a set mix I use every night that will sporadically disappear. I then have to search through all the sounds and try to remember the exact mix I used last and it disrupts my sleep. Some of the sounds also have weird background sounds that have no purpose and wake you up. I’m writing this at 4:49am after the background sounds prevent me from going back to sleep.

My only concern at this point; the *Pro access to meditations doesn’t allow you to test the programs to decide if you would even enjoy the meditations. I prefer; try before buy.

I went out on a limb and tried this app in attempt to get some much needed sleep — and it WORKED.

You can also set a timer for the app to turn off so that you don't have to worry about waking up to it running, or a dead phone, after you've fallen asleep.

Possibly a distant relative, since all I did was use it to cope with extreme insomnia. I don't have insomnia anymore, although that may be more a result of coincidentally picking up a marijuana habit. However, as a natural method of treating insomnia and as a mellow background noise for your sesh, I must give it my due praise. The quality is high, and the selection ever-increasing, and I don't even pay for the Pro stuff.",Excellent quality and selection even free
4,2018-03-19 19:06:28,We purchased this app after a friends recommendation. Our 10 year old daughter has trouble sleeping and often feels anxiety over what may have occurred during the day or week.  After working with er on several of the sleep meditations she is starting to see the benefits herself and now wants to explore further on her own.  I am removing a star due to once small UX issue. When you select a sound you have to change the level immediately or deselect and respect to bring the level option back up. There needs to be a better way to mix the soundscapes.,Helpful with anxiety

I like that there are many options of sounds, music and walk-through meditations that I can choose from, and I use it for everything from creating a relaxing spa-like atmosphere if I’m taking a bath, to helping me control my breathing for a deeper sleep. Great job to these developers, I’ve recommended it to my patients!",Great sleep app
5,2020-05-22 02:00:11,"Ok, I absolutely love this app, and you should definitely get it. I think of it as one of my favorite apps, but, the unlimited version of the app is so annoying. I get that you have to make money, but there’s barely anything you can do without running into that thing. I don’t want to have to pay for it, BUT if it was free, yes, it would be my favorite app. But you have to pay for almost everything on there, And it gets kinda annoying.  Other than that, it’s great.

5,2020-01-15 06:44:37,"Few months back I moved to a very busy metropolitan area. All day and night I heard sounds of cars, helicopters, yelling, you name it. I started developing acute insomnia and sleep anxiety due to it. I tried everything holistic, but finally succumbed to sleeping medications.   Fast forward: I was able to wane off medication with ear buds and improved sleep hygiene, but I needed that extra “oomf” to help me relax and fall asleep. I spontaneously decided to download this app. It is godsend. This beautiful melody, coupled with an oil diffuser and ear buds, have helped me finally acclimate to my new surroundings.   THANK YOU!",CHANGED MY LIFE
5,2019-02-14 11:16:33,"First I wanna start by saying I’m a big fan of the app it really helps me a lot personally, one feature that I found could be better was the bedtime feature right now I can only set one bedtime reminder for certain days but it would help me and I’m sure many others if you had the ability to set different times for certain days instead of being limited to one as my job doesn’t always get out at the same time it affects what time I finish everything and should go to sleep.",Needed Feature
5,2018-12-20 06:01:06,I love this app because it allows me to mix and match different sounds to better my sleep depending on what I want to hear. I always sleep with a small box fan running mainly for the noise but as its getting colder I don’t want the air blowing. With this app I don’t have to run the fan at all there’s a fan sound! Highly recommend for people who travel often as well since it can be super helpful in hotels to make the room have similar sounds that you would hear in your own bedroom from city noise to waterfalls.,Great Sleep/Calm sound app
5,2018-11-27 06:33:47,"My husband likes to stay up and watch tv later than I do and it's so hard to sleep with sounds of television blaring! He is also a very loud, annoying snorer! I thought I'd see if this would work to drown out the tv and his awful snoring. It works! There are times I'll still wake up if he's snoring, but if I concentrate on the sounds of this app, I easily fall back to sleep. Love it!! It's definitely a keeper. I use it every night! The sound is great quality. I'm contemplating buying the full version because I love it so much!",Best app ever! It's a sleep saver!
5,2018-08-09 21:13:36,"I have had this app for a few years. I like it a lot. I got really mad after a few times where they updated the app and I lost sounds that I had paid for by buying “pro” —- but after leaving a negative review explaining this, developer customer service reached out and explained I could get it all back with the “restore subscription” option under settings. WOOHOO! Favorite sleep sound app back on line. If you are having this problem just do that! Thanks Ipnos.",Updated review: restore subscription feature saved me!
5,2018-07-02 03:09:55,"Very nice, lots of sounds to choose from, and there are meditations to try. The speaker has a very calm voice, but it isn't annoying in the slightest. Some sounds require VIP, but I can understand that. Very few ads, great sound quality. I don't regret downloading this.  The writing above is prewritten by someone idk who. But idc, I actually really love this app. So soothing and so many options, and the voice thing is great! I love that you can listen to your choice of sounds while listening to her. Very clear sound and I’m rlly happy that I have this :))",Love it
5,2018-06-26 02:06:26,"I’m only a teenager and many unpleasant things happen to me on a daily basis. Though, my therapist encouraged me to try out Relax Melodies.. when I sleep, it gives me full relaxation and I can peacefully rest the whole night without any trouble. I love that you can set a timer and select your melodies. This app has changed my sleeping habits and has made a large improvement in my mood. In my opinion, if you have anxiety throughout the day/night or you just cannot find a helpful way to unwind, Relax Melodies is for you. Hope you enjoy!",Best Sleep Ever!
5,2018-06-19 02:53:24,"The free version of this app gives you quite a few sounds to choose from. It's super easy to use and I love that you can have as many sounds as you want going at once. Also, some other apps I tried would shut off when you lock your phone screen which is kind of a problem, but not with this one. The only thing I want to change is the timer option, as right now I only see a 30 minute option. Still, it doesn't take much battery at all to just leave on.",Great free app
5,2018-06-12 04:59:59,"This app is a good app in my opinion, it helps me got to sleep quickly and when I don’t use this app it takes me about 1 hour just to fall asleep. I was the first one in my family to use this app and then I showed everyone in my family the app and they absolutely just loved it is what they told me. So I suggest you should get this app. But the only problem with the app for me is that it has pro things that you have to pay for, but I guess that is how the people that made the app get there money back.",Is this app a good app or not?
5,2018-05-18 02:16:02,"My husband and I have used this app for a few years, and we have not been disappointed! We work full time and are students so our entire week is go go go, and it can be hard to unwind and get sufficient  sleep. This app has helped us not only to relax at night, but to drown out outside noises. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes soft, ambient sounds to help them relax and sleep well. I like having the ability to play multiple sounds at varying volumes over each other simultaneously. Great app!",Great app for sleep!
2,2018-06-05 06:01:55,"Original review (4 stars, 2017): I have anxiety and insomnia, and my husband loves the white noise of a fan to fall asleep. I don't really like the fan noise, but this app has been a good compromise to lull us both to sleep. It's fun to create different combinations too.  Update (6/5/18): I have been a user of Relax Melodies for several years. I paid for the premium content not long after I started using the app because I loved the selection of sounds.   A few months ago, I signed up to be a beta tester for the app using TestFlight. Tonight, I opened Relax Melodies to see it has converted to a paid subscription “Pro” version, locking the sounds I already paid for behind a paywall. I realize you have to make money, but this subscription model is a disservice to Premium users who already paid for the app. It feels like a bait-and-switch tactic.  The user interface is more complicated and less intuitive than it used to be. I do like that you can now filter sounds by type (e.g. nature, baby), but that’s the only positive of this update for me.",Update: new subscription model disappointing
5,2018-01-22 14:01:32,"Plenty of sounds choices, you can adjust the volume of each individual sound, combine various sounds to make your own mix, and save your combinations.  Really good for meditation, reading, etc. Certainly worth checking out.   There’s one thing that could stand to improve. There are several sounds that are for the paid version. However, you cannot sample those sounds to see if you like them or not. The maker of this app should really consider allowing a sample of each of the paid sounds.",Love it.
3,2018-05-17 03:18:24,The repositioning of the timer and sounds menu to the top of the screen vs the bottom where it originally was is not appreciated. It is much more annoying to get to in this position especially in the dark and half asleep. For a woman with small hands it’s a pain which doesn’t sound like much but when I paid the lifetime subscription to have what seems like a simple thing change it’s more than a pain to fumble with this now having to use two hands to accomplish the same task. Switch it back please. And the smaller font may look cleaner but it’s harder to read. Hopefully this gets edited back as well.,"Great app, not a great update"
5,2023-06-21 19:55:22,I tried the app for the first time listening to the green noise option and my husband and I both fell asleep fast. I have always had difficulty getting to sleep. I always slept with the tv on for the noise but sometimes that didn’t work. ( Unfortunately keeping my husband up at nights too because of the tv.) I saw a commercial of the app specifically referencing green noise for racing thoughts and figured I have nothing to lose to just try it.  It worked!!!!,Green noise works!
3,2023-09-09 17:12:15,I really enjoy all the options of sounds you can play. That helps a lot many options to pick from.  What I don’t like are the following  1) app tracking the stages of sleep it’s very off. I picked a trail run for another very popular sleep app and this one did a much better job with recording the stages.  2) it doesn’t record much some days and other days it does. It will also be very off on what the noise it recorded is.  I wish those were all better but still the price point for a year is far too high I can’t justify paying that price when the other app which has sounds and better tracking and recording is spot on I don’t have to correct category at all their price point for a year is very reasonable and fair. So I will be switching.  But have I enjoyed this app yes I have the choices of sounds is a wide variety but just because of that I can’t pay any of the options all priced way too high.,Enjoy the sounds but that’s about it
5,2023-02-18 03:59:10,"The app is the most consistently relaxing form of content that helps me sleep. That being said, I’ve noticed in recent updates that you guys advertise new music or meditation or hypnosis with an animation. I think you should stick to that.  instead of using the pause screen, especially for the hypnosis or meditation you should use the animations.  it helps to refocus on the speaker when you can more quickly visualize what’s happening.",Animations instead of the pause screen?
5,2021-06-07 14:21:55,"I highly recommend this! Love the aesthetics of this app. It looks gorgeous; it has so many sounds and meditations. I especially love that it has sleep stories! Plus, I had a minor issue with one of the developer’s other apps and my experience with customer service was just wonderful. The very kind lady answered my questions and went above and beyond to help me! I have 2 other Relax apps from this developer and they are long time favorites of mine. Now I have this new one to love! 💞",Beautiful app!
4,2022-11-26 13:49:37,"I got this app mainly to monitor my sleep patterns and stages.  I can’t quite figure out how the Journal works.  Sometimes it lists the different days at the top, other times it is stuck on the current or previous day and I can’t see the other daily history.  Sometimes I set the Sleep button to record, but the next day I find that it didn’t record.  It is useful to hear the different sounds during sleep, snoring, breathing, etc.  I’m not sure how accurate the different sleep stages, light, deep, REM, etc. are being reported.",Journal issues
5,2020-11-02 03:34:08,"I personally have a hard time going to sleep easily. With just silence, my mind will run away with itself. I’ve tried a few different apps, but let me tell you this is by far my favorite. I use it every night when I’m going to bed, and fairly often during the day when I need to focus. The app allows you to make your own mixes with different sounds, which I love. And it gives you timers so that the sound won’t stay on all night. A fantastic app for sure.",The BEST for keeping calm and going to sleep
5,2019-04-26 04:22:38,"I never leave reviews but I have to share what a Godsend this app has been for me. I suffer from severe anxiety and it usually is the worst at night. After I started therapy and new medication, I was able to use this app to help calm my thoughts at night. Now that I have the anxiety under control, the sound I created puts me to sleep almost instantly. I went from being full insomnia and anxiety to well-rested and feeling better about life. Sometimes it’s the little things that make the difference. Thanks so much.",Helpful tool for anxiety
4,2020-09-12 23:21:23,I’ve had this app for quite a while we bought a lifetime subscription and have talked other people just by showing on the app into purchasing it as well. The reason it doesn’t get five stars is because it removed my absolute favorite sound. It makes me sad because I don’t use it nearly as much as I did because I like the variety of sounds for meditation but for sleeping I miss JOY. I’ll probably have to find another app to help me with the white noise while I sleep. I wish you guys would bring it back.,Where did joy go?
5,2018-11-27 03:28:30,"This app is my number one go to for calming and relaxing my mind and body!! The sounds are absolutely beautiful and incredible!! I love how you can blend all the sounds you want to create that special place in your mind to escape to!! The developers are wonderful and quickly responding to whatever needs you may have regarding the app! I purchased the lifetime subscription which means I get omg access to all  of the sounds, meditations, and hrtzs. This app I soooooo worth every single dime spent on it! This is by far the BEST RELAXATION APP IN THE APP STORE!! GET IT!! DOWNLOAD IT AND ALLOW IT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!",Amazing
5,2018-11-08 03:57:59,I like the amount of individual sounds and their many different types of tracks that each have a little different stuff. There are some very nice combinations I can make and I don’t get bored with generic ones. There are even different types of rain. Though I’m disappointed that I can only unlock two new sounds when I write a review. It may be better to give a handful in comparison to the many you get when upgrading. I look forward to growth.,"Worth it, diverse; sad that I only get two sounds when I review."
5,2018-10-05 03:23:02,I’ve been using this app for over three months now! I love all of the different music choices for backgrounds instead of just white noise! I think that the binaural beats and isochronic tones are cool AND affective! I appreciate that you can look through combinations made my other users if you’re not the creative type. You can even share your own if you are! Here’s so many sounds to use even if you don’t have premium! It amazes me that all of this is totally free! I absolutely love this app and I use it EVERY NIGHT! 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND!!,LOVE IT
5,2018-07-27 16:18:12,"Ok... I love all the different music options that you can pick from. You can make your own music and so that it suits what you would like to listen to when you fall asleep. I use mine very night and it really helps me stay relaxed and have a better goodnight sleep. And if you don’t want to make your own... you could always listen to one made by others, and you can search the name of one. (Mine is called “tucked in”) please consider reading it. Anyways I really love this app and I can see myself using this a lot.",The Best App!!!
4,2018-09-12 04:45:11,"The ONLY reason I gave this app a 4 versus a 5 star rating is due to the fact that you must pay a monthly fee to use some of the more beneficial features rather than paying a flat fee for the app... not to say $1.33 or $1.67 is not affordable, but for an app it seems odd or out of place to pay a monthly fee versus, again, just a one time purchase amount that isn’t $99. Moving on— As far as the rest of the app is concerned, I love it. It offers a ton of different sounds from white noise to peepers and ocean waves. I love that you can layer noises and customize a ton of different settings.",Customizable & fast sleeping
5,2018-05-23 04:33:08,I have used several white noise apps and apps to cover background noise.  I prefer this one because I can control the volume of each sound if I am mixing 2 or more sounds.  The sounds are not as obviously on a loop like some apps.  The variety of sounds to choose from is great and I like that there are several versions of rain sounds to choose from or mix. The musical sounds are relaxing and somehow subdued to be a more pleasant sleep experience.  The breathing and sleep instruction is helpful and well grounded.,Great for sleep and reading
4,2018-06-25 03:18:00,"We always use this app when traveling. My husband is a very light sleeper and has to have white noise to fall asleep. We have a white noise machine at home, but this app fills in nicely for a hotel stay. I like that you can layer different sounds to make your own custom sound. My only complaint is the same one I have for any of the sound machines- you can hear the ""loop"" on many of the tracks, which is distracting for my husband. But we have found that by layering one sound over another, you can pretty much mask that flaw. All in all, it has been a great travel companion.",Long time user
5,2018-05-19 09:41:45,"I use this every night. When having a lot of things on my mind, I would turn the app on, in a few minutes I am so relax. I love it, my grandchildren loves it  (puts them to sleep fast) used during naps and bedtime. The kids (ages 2,4 and 8) get to choose  their own sounds. So using the app has improve the necessary hours of each age group that is required to get enough sleep for the day or within a 24 hour period. The kids are more focus in listening and learning skills shows great improvement. Love it!",Love the app!
5,2018-03-06 18:22:10,I like it. Liked it so much I bought it.   Not just for sleep of course.   Who are you at this moment? Who will you be in the next moment? These questions deserve time and reflection. That’s what I’m using Mediatation for right now.   Best meditation app I’ve seen yet. Keep up the good work.   Frogs - oceans - crickets - humans- rain- the music of life all here. The ease of use is - well - easy.   Havent tried it for sleep yet but I kind of feel like sleep is a culmination of the lead up to it. I am sleeping well.   Gotta be a good buy for sleep sufferers I know. I use it for everything.  And no need to pay if it’s just not in the budget. This is important - the free access - Plenty of free stuff - enough for a lifetime.   The paid stuff is cool too.   Thanks again! Great job to those who brought this to fruition and all the way to my phone. Much appreciated,Gorgeous magnificent purposeful sublime success. Haven’t tried for sleep yet
5,2017-12-15 15:22:55,"I've been through several white noise/sleep aid apps before, and none of them were helpful. Either they had bad sound selections or they just didn't operate well. But this app is WONDERFUL. Tons of sounds, even with the free version, and the ability to create any number of combinations for any number of uses, and also save them for future use so you don't have to remake them every time. I use it to help me sleep, and just in the few days I've had it, I've slept SO WELL. It's a truly brilliant app, five stars all the way.",Really amazing app!
3,2018-01-19 05:51:38,"The sounds are great, but the loops are too short and they get annoying especially the tonal/instrumental ones. Also, it's difficult to adjust the volume of a sound once several are playing. I have to find the tone (sometimes having to swipe multiple pages) and then shut it off, then turn it on and then I can adjust the volume. It would be helpful if the sounds selected were highlighted more distinctly than just the little away. Maybe change the color of the icon or better, create a ""now playing page"" where I can easily view and adjust the current mix.",Great app but needs work
5,2022-10-26 03:45:07,"The paid version is completely worth it imo. Soooo many sounds and the meditations are actually really neat. There’s also bedtime stories which I didn’t know I needed lol.  If I could make one request to the devs, both thunder sounds are too loud. If y’all could come out with one that’s a slower quieter rolling thunder. The “thunder” sound gets it right most of the time but some of the claps of thunder are way too loud, similar to the “thunderstorm” sound.",Comprehensive and full feature in paid version
1,2023-08-16 17:42:23,"I bought this app to use one sound to sleep at night, and they have added so many things, which is not a problem, but they bombard the app with constant advertisements to buy more, and have even put a VIP advertisement when you open up the app that you can’t even get around without restarting the app and hitting the play button quickly. I already paid for this app, their advertisements are making it almost unusable. I kind of feel like this would be a potential lawsuit. Imagine buying a house and then you can’t have access to it because your realtor blocks the door and you have to go around to the back door to be able to get into your house.",Disappointment
2,2023-02-28 20:09:55,"*Update 2: Back to not working. I’ve update to the latest version and now I can no longer listen to music in the background. I see this was feature was removed and then reinstated. Why? New ownership? Fix it!!!!  *Update* That worked! Thanks for the response! 5 stars!! Stories, mediations, and music are all fantastic. Amazing updates that clearly show the developers listen to customer feedback. My only complaint is the latest update does not allow me to listen to binaural beats while listening to my own music via Apple Music. So amazing developers, please let me know if this is something that can be reinstated or if I’m doing something wrong!",Awesome App

Definitely recommend this app hands down if you are having a hard time falling asleep or even having trouble with in anxiety or self love.",THISSS APP
3,2022-02-16 08:11:04,It’s helpful but I don’t like how I can’t even sample the locked items until I pay for the upgrade. It really defeats the purpose in my opinion because I am going to be unwilling to pay if I don’t know whether or not I will like the sound. I realize that the sound could still be used this way however to help prevent that you can always add a feature where you can only hear up to a certain amount of time. Then if someone really wants to use that sound they will have to purchase the upgrade. It works really well in other sleep apps I have tried before.,Review
5,2020-12-07 06:47:56,"as someone who is very poor and very stressed, i’m so glad there’s a cheaper alternative to calm app. my favorite thing about this is you can play multiple sounds at once. i have adhd so i tend to focus on the pattern of a single sound which can be distracting for sleep. this new custom mix really helps my thoughts to stop racing so much. 11/10 amazing thanks. can’t believe it’s free and i may even buy some of the other sounds if i’m ever not broke 🥴⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ also i cannot see what i’m typing for some reason so pls excuse any typos",WHO NEEDS CALM APP!

5,2020-09-30 04:25:32,"There are SOOOOOOO many sounds to choose from, & you aren't limited to just one at a time! You can combine & layer them to make it exactly your own special kind of relaxation sounds.

5,2020-04-13 02:35:57,"So I downloaded this app that had the most rate which was 5 stars and I honestly like it so far so here is my opinions that some of these things that would change, 1 . Some things you have to pay but that isn’t fair because others might have not a lot of money to pay some stuff. Honestly I thinks that is really it but could you please stop some free trials and some stuff you need to pay. Thanks so much and have a good day 🥰",It’s Heaven to my ears but need some few changes
5,2018-09-29 12:56:41,"So far so good. Granted, I have only tried it one time and I was already a little tired, but this app knocked me out in under 5 min. I am one of those people that sleep with my tv on but I turned it off picked my sounds and set a timer to turn off the app after an hr. But I was out way before then. And I slept like a log. Literally. I usually wake up 30 times a night especially when my husband has to work overnight.  I didn’t wake up until he came home the next morning. Next I will be trying the app on him.",Wow

5,2018-09-02 01:34:21,This app is better then I expected!! I have a very hard time falling asleep and this app really helps with that. Also the sounds are soothing and help to relax. Another great thing about this app is it has meditations that can help you if your mad or angry or if you want to just hear a soothing voice. One thing I would change is having to pay for an even bigger amount of sounds all though it’s worth it it would still be nice to have all the sounds with out gaveling to pay. Get app,Greatest thing in the would!!
5,2018-08-07 03:01:37,"I have used this app for the past 5 or 6 years. I used to have a very hard time falling asleep (even now still do occasionally) but once I found this app and selected the sounds that relaxed me it I used it as a tool to cue my body to know when to fall asleep. The best thing about this app in my opinion isn’t that it has so many options but that it allows you to custom the combination of sounds along with how much of each, giving you exactly what you need. Get the app. You won’t regret it.",The best out there

Make it one click off too and this will be the next thing out there. Thanks!",Love it

5,2018-01-25 05:29:04,"I like the variety of sound options provided in the free version of the app. On other similar apps, some background sounds (river, rain, forest, etc) have loops you can start to hear, but none that I’ve noticed on here which makes relaxing time quite peaceful!  There are many sounds that alone are quite nice (I listen to “river” every night), but the whole idea of combining some together is fun too.

I do wish some of the melodies were longer before they repeated themselves.... they can really get stuck in my head.",Good for mom and baby
5,2017-09-06 00:45:07,"I use it with my kids and they fall asleep wonderfully! My three year old falls asleep in five to ten minutes, my five year old about 5, and my ten year old is learning meditation and relaxation from it and is out in under thirty minutes.   He tends to be an anxious kid and after school, before homework we started using the meditation for ten minutes... it has been amazing.  I find it to be healthy mind over body practice too.  They would never listen to me and I don't want to pay for them to do yoga classes.  This app is amazing!",I LOVE THIS APP
5,2017-08-10 01:10:52,"I've used the free version of this app for several months. It has always worked and has many different sounds for various moods or purposes. I love being able to combine sounds while adjusting each one's volume to get the perfect combination. Sounds vary from actual melodies with different instruments to nature sounds to the standard A/C, rain, and white noise and even a cat purr. I'm definitely tempted to upgrade and will probably do so soon. Currently use it while sleeping (noisy neighborhood), meditation, and reading.",Love wide range of choices.
5,2017-07-16 01:59:17,I've been using this app now coming up on 2 months. The reason for downloading it was to hopefully find a way to wind down & fall asleep faster. I honestly didn't have high expectations. What I didn't expect was for it to meet those expectations and also sound so realistic. I purchased some string lights w/ built in Bluetooth speakers and I must say the app along with the speakers are crazy. It sounds so realistic that I have to remind myself it's just an app. I use the combo of rainstorm + thunderstorm & also night + peepers ( best combo I've discovered ).,Wow!!!
5,2023-09-07 04:17:33,I’ve been using this app for over a decade now. I first downloaded it in college trying to get to sleep in a dorm with a snoring roommate. Back then it was only a few sleep sounds you could custom mix. But I loved it. I was able to snag a lifetime membership for $10 and that has been the best $10 I ever spent. The way it has grown over the last decade is amazing. The stories and meditations are top notch. I listen to Starship-28 almost every night. Could not love or recommend this app more.,The Best
5,2023-01-31 02:53:32,"I absolutely love this app and it actually works for me. I love how you can pick the sounds you want and adjust each of their volumes. I love the sound of rain and I layered rain and thunderstorm sounds to help me sleep last night and it worked perfectly. Even though some of the sounds are locked, the ones available work perfectly fine for me and there’s still a good variety to choose from without having to pay",Perfect in every way
3,2023-02-13 08:02:17,"i love this app SO much. it makes me fall asleep so quick. But i had gotten premium and than it expired, i had accidently bought it again but refunded it with my bank so i had it for about 2 weeks and then i couldnt play my favorite music. i am beyond upset and i cannot fall asleep without it now 🫤. I really wish that they could make alot more music + sounds free. Another thing that happend recently is i open the app and it freezes. Cant do anything. So i have to like wait for it and open it. Wait a bit then open it again. Sometimes it takes a while. Im just BEYOND upset.",I love it but..
5,2022-04-24 14:43:42,"I've tried almost everything to help me sleep through the night with short lived successes. The variations available in the form of nature sounds, brain waves, and music on this app help me to adjust my experience each night for mood, discomfort, etc. The sounds are high quality and I find myself just playing the app all day with no need for other distractions to focus or relax my mind. This is the best app purchase I've ever made.",I can finally sleep through the night!
5,2022-02-21 04:10:28,A couple years ago I use this app that was referred to me by my therapist who uses it herself. I absolutely loved it. However I ended up changing jobs and was given the calm app and so I canceled this app. Here it is February 2022 and I got back with my therapist to re-recommended this to myself to try to help with my stress and sleeping issues. I love the meditation for night time and the stories. My favorites are the Stargate stories. I wish they would make more of them because they are only three.,Awesome App
5,2021-11-24 06:10:31,"So far I've only had it for a few days, but it was worth it to me to buy the lifetime upgrade. I have been using it at work to drown out office noise but not be as distracting as music & want to sing to. I love the customization ability of this app!!! I tried another & could only do 3 sounds at a time. On this one, you can add 12 sounds together!! And save it as a favorite if you want to play the same mix again. I plan to try the guided meditations at home as well.",Love it!!
5,2020-10-30 20:57:27,"I finally gave in and signed up for the premium because I wanted the additional sounds and stories. I LOVE the Starship-28 stories and the nature sounds, I always drift off to sleep easily when listening to them. I also like the option of setting a timer and whether or not you want it to stop playing at the end of that time or if you want it to close the app. The premium option is worth every penny but even if you just have the free options, you won’t regret trying it. Sweet dreams!",Best App to Help You Sleep
5,2018-10-08 04:52:48,"The best part of this app is you can easily create unique melodies that soothe you by mixing two or more together. My fav mix is the river or rain and birds chirping. So many options that are free, I'm considering purchasing the premium to see what more goodies they have. Solid, simple format, does as it advertises. All meditation apps need to follow this route, offering amazing, consistent free service then offering additional for a price. Instead of giving teasers and forcing to pay full price for half quality like other lousy apps do.",Above n beyond expectations!
1,2020-07-18 18:02:07,"I used to have an old version of this app that they stopped updating even though people paid to use it. I finally bit the bullet and downloaded this version and...it’s a mess? A bunch of the sounds I used to like aren’t even an option anymore (on EITHER app version), not even with the paid subscription. Why would I pay $60 a year for an app that doesn’t even have what I want, but is instead bogged down with features I have no use for? I’m sure a lot of people get use out of the meditations and stories, and that’s fine. But those are of no interest to me, personally. I just want the sounds I used to use.   So again, why on earth would I pay $60 a year for something that I already paid a one-time purchase for years ago when the new version no longer even has what I want? And even if it did have what I want, there’s no guarantee that they’ll keep those sounds between app updates?   It’s frustrating. At least bring back the “Joy” music sound!   Five stars for use over the years, but I cannot rate this app highly in its current form.","Loved for years, now a mess."
4,2019-02-07 07:04:06,"I use this app every single night. I live in an environment with a lot of noise and this helps me fall asleep every night. I love it! Only downside, and it might just be my phone (iPhone 8) that the sound seems to stop coming from the app after an hour or so. It used to go all night but now I find myself waking up to noise (or lack of peaceful noise from this app) and am wondering if it’s a new update or something my phone is doing. However, if you are looking for an app to help you sleep, you’ve found it. I’ve tried others and this is by far my favorite.","Love it, but...."
5,2018-09-13 19:26:00,"I really like this app. It's perfect to add the exact amount of noise that I want when I want it. There are so many options for sounds to choose from. My favorite feature is that I can set it to be on for a half hour and then to exit the app. That way it isn't on all night, but just until after I fall asleep. One suggestion would be to have the option to adjust that length of time, but really I am so pleased with this app. I have a few sound machine apps and this is the one I always go to.",Really Great
5,2018-08-17 03:36:34,"I use this so much, especially when I can’t fall asleep and I have school in the morning. Trying to sleep would normally take a few hours, but now takes me a half hour or less. I am very grateful this app is exists, but I wish I could add a song from my library, at least in the beginning because I have so many soothing songs that would make this a lot better for my personal experience. But this is just coming from a pre teen, so I don’t know what my word is worth.",Effective and useful
5,2018-08-12 21:13:58,Even though you have to be pay to get some of the sounds cost money but you get 56 sounds free and you can mix the as many times as you want to make your perfect melody and you can save that perfect melody and name it so you can go back to it and listen to it again. Also it helps me a lot bc I have a sleeping problem and I have a hard time going to sleep and I just put earphones in and listen to the Melody’s I created and it helps me go to sleep. thank you whoever created it this app helps me big time.,I love it  best
5,2018-07-16 01:39:47,"I love using this app to help me sleep at night. I used to have thoughts running all through my head when I’d be trying to fall asleep, and I had serious difficulty falling asleep and then staying asleep. This app has not only helped relax me (like the name in the app says...ha), but also get me ready for sleep and then have much higher quality sleep. They have a great array of sounds to choose from and various calming meditations to prepare you for sleep. I look forward to listening every night!",Can’t imagine being without it!
5,2018-07-12 04:37:21,"I love this app. It helps block out the sound of my dog pacing the hallway at night. Also the ability to blend sounds to make it unique to my taste is awesome. We use it every night at home from an old cell phone we have it hooked up to some old computer speakers on the nightstand. It has replaced a very expensive sound soother from Sharper Image that died after years of use. When we travel, we just have it play through my phone speakers and it does the job just fine.",Perfect for blocking out a noisy house
5,2018-06-04 12:21:19,"Amazing app. I’ve had trouble falling asleep my whole life. It has always felt like I have a thousand thoughts in my head and I can’t shut them off. But listening to the sounds on this app just seems to hush all those sounds and allows me to sleep very, very peacefully and wake up well rested and in a pleasant mood. Very easy to use and I love how you can combine and mix and match sounds. Tons of options to choose from. The free version is good enough, but the paid version is very well worth the money. Love this app.",Difference maker
5,2018-05-13 21:23:07,Love this app! There’s a timer that comes with the regular free package that turns the app off - not just the sound. Even better - you can set the timer. Want to listen to ocean sounds for 2 hours while you fall asleep? You can!  Want to listen to flutes and drums while you meditate for 1/2 hour- it’s easily done. Want to listen to ocean waves and birds and wind? You can combine sounds and then save your favorites!!! Also site walks you thru meditations to help restore sleep. Great programs included with free package!!,Timer Free - makes this the best app of it’s kind!!!
5,2018-03-03 03:46:50,Great app! Totally worth the upgrades!!  I have never been the type of person who can just fall asleep at night. My mind often wanders and I can’t think of sleep. Instead my mind is focused on the next day or what happened the day before. This allows me to use the meditations to help me relax my mind and allow me to sleep. I bought the premium and I love it. I noticed that my average amount of sleep at night went up from 4 1/2 hours a night to about 7. 100% recommend it for anyone with sleep issues,Sleeping Angel
5,2021-07-28 02:37:38,This app helps me go to sleep at a decent time and helps me improve my sleep a lot better than normal it also helps me when I am stressed out! The voices on the app are so calming and the music is just brilliant!!! It also helps me be ready for school the next morning it just makes me feel a lot better when I can sleep better and I feel a lot healthier! My counselor also recommended this on my school counseling page!!!!,Can totally relax at night and get a great sleep!
4,2018-01-22 16:51:31,"This app does what I was hoping it would do. Plenty of good sounds to select from to make your own unique mixes for what you want and the special features for using it to go to sleep, etc. Easy to use, lots of sound selection, individual volume settings, etc. Also, it stays on when using other apps. I imagine I might even use the campfire, night sounds and lapping waves mix I made while camping to get to sleep in a tent and even by the lakeshore, although that seems like taking it a bit too far!  Anyway, Great app!","Great app for whit noise,  background noise, etc. Very calming."
5,2020-03-20 14:34:26,"I was in a store in Florida and somehow me and the girl who worked there started talking about sleeping issues. She recommended this app and now I do the same for other people! It’s wonderful and really helps my mind calm down, my only complaint is $60 is more than I would pay for an actual sleep sound device and much more than any app has ever asked for premium features. I wish the price was lower because that’s just extremely high but other than that the free features are great.",Helps so much
5,2020-01-05 10:58:53,"I have always had trouble sleeping, until I downloaded this app. It helps me keep my mind off other things when I try to go to bed. I can make my own calming and smoothing sounds with all of their options! Nature sounds, water sounds, house sounds, animal sounds, city sounds, and some A.S.M.R sound too! You are able to turn your electronic and it will still play the sounds. I like to turn off my phone and charge it overnight.

5,2019-01-04 08:15:30,"Growing up I always had trouble sleeping. I’ve tried so many methods but they never worked yet for some reason this app worked like magic. I thought ‘Oh it’s going to just be methods put into an app’ but I don’t know... something about it just easily knocks me out in a couple of seconds, and just really helps me calm in stressful situations. (I have diagnosed SAD which is also a big disruption in my sleeping)  P.S.  Premium isn’t exactly necessary but definitely do recommend purchasing","Helped me a lot, wonderful and well recommended"
5,2018-11-08 14:39:41,I absolutely love this app! I’m a dog sitter so I’m often at other people’s houses. I need some comforting noises when going to bed to calm me. I love that you can have make your own mixture of sounds and choose the volume of each sound separately!! I also really love that I don’t have to keep the app open or my phone awake for it to keep working. This app is an absolute requirement for me!! Edit: They’ve added more “spa” or “meditation” sounds that are so relaxing! I actually use the app when I’m getting a massage instead of their music!,Love!!
5,2018-10-27 04:44:37,"I quite like this app. I've had it for a couple years I think and it helps me get to sleep every night. It also helps with my depression and insomnia. Love this product, I'd definitely recommend for someone looking to relax and unwind. I also have tinnitus and my audiologist wants me to have sound going all night and this doesn't automatically shut off after not using it for an hour (unless you choose that setting) and so it lets me wake up with less pain.

5,2018-10-06 00:44:13,This app is fantastic. My mother suffers from hearing loss and dementia. When she’s up roaming the house at all hours I but my ear bugs in turn on the app and it helps relax and sleep which in turns keeps me for getting anger at my mom even though I know she can’t help it i still would get upset about her illness because I would be tired from not getting sleep but now with this app it really helps my situation.  I have the free version because taking care of my elderly mother is expensive and I have to stay on a budget.,Love this app...
5,2018-09-27 02:21:38,"My cousin spent the night at my house one night, and I pulled out my $20 sound machine… She asked me why I bought it; and I responded, so I can go to sleep!  She then laughed at me and opened her Relax Melodies app.  My sound machine at only 6 sounds. Relax Melodies, on the other hand, gave me the option to create my own sounds (thunder, the ocean, chimes, wind... the list goes on because there are well over 50+ sounds) and it completely put my sound machine to shame!!

5,2018-07-27 05:43:09,"I love this app! I was exhausted and finally out of pain, waiting for surgery in a few hours. But every little noise was wearing me out. So once I remembered this app, which I got for bedtime with my child, I used it anytime, day or night that I needed sleep! I changed the sounds as needed and love that I could layer sounds and adjust the mix. I would not have rested with some nonstop train sound or waves and seagulls.  I needed some good nature sounds and some sleep at about midnight. And I got it with this app! I would recommend it to anyone!",Much needed sleep

Unfortunately sometimes when I’m getting ready to pick my sounds to listen to or after I’ve just picked my sounds, a pop-up shows up and goes straight to the internet for some kind of ad or something. This has happened on multiple occasions and I don’t like it at all. The app has plenty of sounds to chose from. I’ve listened to all of the free meditations. They’re OK; I wish they would use different voices because that woman’s voice can sound monotonous and get annoying to listen to over time. Overall it’s a decent app.",I like it
5,2018-07-24 04:29:13,At night when I’m heading to bed I turn this on and I have to listen to it for like five minuets then when my head hits the pillow I’m sound asleep I love this app when I have anxiety I turn this on and listen to the flute and the water fall and it calms me I do wish that you would make more apps like this but over all I  give you a 4 for your amazing sounds that calms me well I should get to bed thank you so much for this app I can fiannally sleep now- ps please make more apps like this gatta sleep now zzzzzzzz,It’s awesome and helps me with anxiety!!👌👌

You can even have little home sessions, to lower stress ,and help yourself relax. They have all these cool sounds to sleep to. Plus you can mix them together like A cat purring and rain or any other sound.

I totally recommend it to everyone.",It is amazing
5,2018-05-19 07:18:56,I love this app. The free version was great but I upgraded after only a few days because I knew this would be the last relaxation app I would use.  Interface and ease of use are seamless and lovely.  I love that I can pick my sleep sounds and the volume of each. I love that there are meditation sessions within the app. It was well worth the upgrade.  I am an insomniac and finding the right mix of sounds through this app has improved my sleep. Please don't change a thing except to add more sounds etc.,The Best Relaxation App
4,2018-06-04 05:06:50,Sleeping has always been a struggle. I am an extremely light sleeper and the least little change in sound or disturbance wakes me and keeps me awake for hours. I tried to find different things to work but medicines make you groggy and ear plugs make me nervous. This app was the perfect addition. It works without shutting down my other apps in place (like my alarm). I can also add other sounds to my sound to create my own personal sleep melody. All work together to create that constant monotonous white noise that blocks other things from waking my brain until morning.,Sleeping beauty
5,2018-05-09 03:17:43,"I’ve been using the app for a long time but just recently started using the meditation portion of the app.  The app itself just for the sounds has always been extremely relaxing and soothing for me. Since I travel a lot it helps me to relax in unfamiliar environments. Now that I’m using the meditation series, I found that it is much easier to relax on the road and to fall asleep.

Then I wake up several times during the night and it's the same story.  But I have wondered if maybe that's been too stimulating for my brain (ya think?).  So I was curious to see if these soothing sounds would help.  It's only been a few nights but so far my sleep has improved and that's something for me.  I combine ""night"" (crickets) with ""birds"" and it's very subtle.  I hope this really is a long term improvement, what a blessing that would be!",So far so good...

But if you do pay you can get an endless amount of soothing sounds, music, or stories. You can even set a timer for how long you want the app to run so you can save battery! I truly recommend this app, it has helped me in many ways and I hope it does for you too.",Love this app
5,2022-07-11 06:53:14,Ok first off I wanna talk about why everyone in the reviews is writing like a whole essay about this app. Second when I don’t feel like falling asleep to music or can’t fall asleep to it I use this app and I swear it controls my mind cause when I use the app I have amazing dreams that could literally be in a Wattpad story about the things and fandoms I am intrested in. So yea this app is cool. You do have to pay for some things in this app but I don’t and it still gives a good experience 👍,Very Good

The ability to control and remix sounds to your linking, the HUGE library of meditations and stories, and the physical exercise guided medications are excellent. 💫 However—there is, in my view, a rather major flaw: the inability to play through Airplay!

2,2022-03-04 05:36:00,"Was excited to try this app since I’ve been dealing with insomnia for the last few weeks and I was looking to try something new.   First, there aren’t any free meditations to listen to. I was hoping to have at least a handful to choose from for a free version, since many meditation apps offer at least that.  Second, there was one free story to listen to. Great, it started off with a lady speaking in a soothing voice about being in a spacecraft and flying around space. Seemed pretty promising to help me relax and fall asleep. But, a few minutes in, a harsh robotic voice repeats “doing head scan”, along with other body part scans over and over again. Sounded like nails on a chalkboard, ugh. Had to laugh to myself because I was drifting to sleep from the story, then was rudely awoken by the robot shortly after.. in the same story.   Besides not really living up to my expectations overall, there are some nice free sounds you can choose from to make your own mix for white noise basically.",Had Higher Hopes
5,2021-06-07 06:38:45,"I love this app because I can choose what sounds I want and mix them together. I can also adjust the volume of each sound. What I love even more is that I can have the volume of my phone to the max for my morning alarm, and my night time sounds that are supposed to be relaxing me are nice and soft instead of blasting at the same max volume. Other apps I’ve tried don’t have that ability and are really frustrating! Love this app!!",My specific mix!!
4,2020-06-30 14:26:11,"This is the best app for falling asleep I have ever found. The soundscapes are amazing and customizable, and the woman’s voice is soothing.  My only complaint is that I have to “restore purchases” every other day or so to keep things unlocked.  This is particularly frustrating at night when I wake up and want to get back to sleep, but all my favorite sessions are locked.  At that point I really have to wake up to remember how to restore purchases.  I hope this is just a glitch that gets fixed, and when it does I will be giving them five stars.",Almost perfect!

It just keeps stopping in the middle of the night and I realize it — I actually wake up because of that and I find myself getting out of bed very often just to turn it back on. I thought it was happening because I had it on a timer or something but I don’t, it just keeps crashing in the middle of the night, every night for the past two months.

They are clear and customizable.  After a few weeks, I tried the meditations. I'm hooked. They help calm your mind down and focus on relaxing your body. As a result, I fall asleep more readily than before.

And it looks like I now have to pay annually for the basic plan that was previously a pay-once thing. I’m disappointed because I really enjoy this app, both at bedtime and during the day at work. I’m sorry to say I won’t be spending yet more money on this app, which I felt was worth the original $20 I spent (but will not renew) but not an additional $30 a year for the expanded content. And NOT $200 for the new lifetime plan. Sorry guys, you had a great thing until trying to shove me into payment plans like everyone else.",“Lifetime” members not grandfathered into new product
1,2018-09-21 03:57:55,"Every time I find a meditation that truly helps me, you replace it. I looked everywhere for the meditation you had years ago, couldn’t find it. Finally you released a new one about breathing and sleep. It was two free sessions and you had to pay for the others. Now this update comes and they’re gone.  I paid for the year subscription just to get them back, but for as much as is charged, new sounds and meditations should be released often.  Changing my review to 1 star because I got a developer response and it didn’t address anything I said, just told me the /names/ of the new meditations as if I can’t read? The problem wasn’t that I CAN’T READ, the problem is I want them to stop replacing all the meditations.",STOP CHANGING MEDITATIONS CONSTANTLY
5,2018-02-09 06:16:19,"I have used quite a few relaxation sound apps to help me sleep, and this one is the best! I say that because of the sound choices mostly. But also being able to individually mix the volumes and get new sounds. Very well thought out, even the free version . This app actually seems to make my brain believe the environments are real and I'm knocked out in less than 15 mins! I love the rainstorm, oscillating fan and thunderstorm sounds. Great for the somewhat experienced meditation too, really aids in clearing thoughts",The best I know of!
5,2022-10-14 20:50:01,"Kind thought I’d seen it all in terms of sleep apps but this one has features that set it apart.  I love the wider variety of sounds and the ability to customize your own mix of relaxing music.  The sound options are more sophisticated than the basic  “ocean sounds,” or “hair dryer,” which is a welcome change.  And the upgraded meditation and sleep hypnosis content feels leveled up from what I’ve been using.  Purchased it for the year.",Better than I expected.
4,2017-08-03 05:40:30,"It takes a bit of getting used to, and quite a but of testing, but there are so many sounds to choose from it's nearly impossible to not find a combo that helps you to relax and sleep.  Very easy to use, I'm very happy with this app. I've tried others but always come back to this one for the quality of the sounds, the ability to mix, and easy of use. I'd definitely recommend this app to anyone who is struggling to sleep, has ringing in their ears, or a noisy street outside their window they don't want to listen to.",Great selection of sounds
3,2022-11-16 05:09:44,"I used this app a lot way back when it was Relax Melodies. It was great then, and it’s still great now. Even better, actually, in many ways. It has a lot more variety of sounds and even a music feature, which is cool. It’s a shame that there’s money involved, now. Many, if not most, of the sounds are now behind a paywall, and the same can be said for pretty much all of the music. I understand that the app needs to make money somehow, but it’s still frustrating, especially for an app that’s meant to be calming and relaxing.","As good as a remember, shame it’s more expensive"
5,2022-01-24 22:33:12,"I’m going to preface this by saying I have not bought the upgrade - it does unlock TONS more sounds, but the free version works just fine for what I need. But it does work beautifully - highly customizable, easy to use, and I’ve noticed it helping my baby to sleep better as well. I only really use the sounds feature, so I can’t say much about the other things this app can do. I do wish there was a way to hide locked content.",Really good app
5,2021-11-29 05:34:44,"This app is helpful for so many things. Including sleep, meditation, concentration, and blocking out other sounds. It gives a wide variety of choices of sounds to listen to and you don't have to listen to just one but you can listen to as many as you can mixed. So overall this app is great!  Edit: I HATE the new app name “BetterSleep” it is so ugly and sounds cheap please change it back to relax melodies. The name BetterSleep makes me feel less relaxed and it’s disgusting. Sorry.",Helpful
5,2021-05-24 16:30:34,I thought this game was just to help you sleep but I have a big problem was because I always wake up in the middle of the night but then I found out that they also have sessions to help you with your stress and I used to have a bunch of weird crazy thoughts in my head and now it’s just so relaxed I can’t believe this game is free I think it is just so amazing you should really get this game if you’re if you’re stressed and stuff and yeah five out of five best game ever,So relaxing

Then the next year I had to pay $20 for meditations and certain sounds if I wanted them, and I did because they work great. But then unknowingly, my $20 subscription changed the next year to only allowing extra access to certain sounds, no meditations, other than the ones that were already free. So I cancelled it and just stuck with the free version. Now, the free version only has access to certain sounds and no meditations at all unless you pay the full yearly amount.

I had higher hopes for the rain, wind  and storm sound -  for some reason they are too harsh and just done sound realistic of relaxing. I think I would like a nice gentle rain falling on the ground, not something that sounds like my shower, rain on asphalt or has an echo.

2,2020-03-05 05:13:11,"The beats were one of my favorite features, and all of them actually worked. I could play them with my sounds and I could sleep amazing. But now they require headphones.... wearing headphones isn’t ideal at all for sleeping, it can be very uncomfortable!! They worked so well for me before so to see that I have to use headphones now is very upsetting :( please revert this Also whenever I try to save any music to a mix, it doesn’t save. Only the sound does. I think that mixes are supposed to save music with them so please fix this as well :) this app is wonderful and truly helps me sleep but these changes will make it great",Please allow binaural beats without headphones; music does not save in mixes

There is a great variety of free sounds and my favorite feature is saving my different “moods” like beach, cabin, rainy afternoon etc that I can listen to again easily.

Super user friendly & I also love the feature of adjusting the level of each individual sound to my taste.",Love this for sleeping
5,2019-01-02 05:29:52,I have trouble falling asleep a lot and in the summer I usually have a fan in my room or something but other times we have radiators so I can’t even hear the heat. I hate sleeping in silence so I got this app. I usually use the rain sounds and falling asleep has been so much easier and it makes my whole room feel so relaxed and nice. It’s also cool because it kinda trains your brain to subconsciously know that it’s time to fall asleep whenever you hear the same relaxing sounds right before you fall asleep.,Great app
5,2018-11-11 09:51:57,"I really enjoy this app for the times when I can’t seem to fall asleep. And if I’m not in restless slumber, it’s pretty relaxing when working on school work. I like how the settings on the sounds are set up, (volume of each sound individually to get the balance you need, the layering of different noises) it made the app really easy to use!

Second, I love that you can combine sounds to get the perfect melody. Last, I like the clock feature. You can pick the design and make it as bright or as fun as you wish. And for the full version, you get a lot of bang for your buck and no ads! I especially like that I can use it on my Apple TV when I'm at home. Overall, a great white noise app.",Fantastic for sleeping
5,2018-05-24 03:57:58,We moved recently and I was having trouble adjusting to the new sounds so I downloaded this app. What a difference!   I mixed together sounds that are most calming to me (waves + white noise + night) and have slept so well every night since. It's like I'm transported to the lake house I spent summers at as a kid. I keep it on all night and it's the perfect blissful sleep zone.

The controls for the sounds are easy to use and help balance out what sounds you enjoy the most for the perfect melody just for you.

I love how you can change the volumes of each different sound and also how you can add as many sounds together as you want. My favorite thing about the app is that you can set a timer and the app will close after that amount of time.

We've used the app as of December 2017.   I've never noticed it until recently when I kept hearing something annoying in my ear and it's the only thing that is making me find another app, the white noise sound tile has this reverberating alarm type sound in the background that is just... not calming.

Now there is only a single alarm and you have to change the time on it as your needs change. Maybe they moved the multiple alarm feature into the paid tier (which…who can tell since they don’t provide version update information and “Help and Support” is just a chatbot), but at least for me taking away a useful feature is not an incentive to pay money.

However, the sleep tracker keeps crashing the app. In addition to that, there used to be a way to set a timer for the app to shut off after a certain amount of time.

I tired exiting out of it but brought me back to it. Also tried to reopen the app but it took over control and took me to my sound playlists, and also added in some howling bird that wasn’t part of my sound mixes. Not even re downloading the app fixed this issue. Maybe after a certain time of having the app will you be able to use it and it’s customizations.

5,2018-12-07 22:10:06,This app is what legit puts me and my boyfriend to sleep every single night and it helps me stay asleep instead of waking up multiple times through out the night. I highly recommend this app to anyone who needs help falling asleep and staying asleep. This app has amazing different sound to choose from and combine. I use the waterfall and the thunder it sounds like a heavy rain storm. I also love how you can choose the volume for different levels of each noise you put together. This app is a life saver.,BEYOND AMAZING!!!

I find that the loops are way too short and find it irritating to keep hearing the same pattern over and over - think the same bird-cricket combo in the woods every few seconds. Not loving the music at all - synthesizers are not soothing to me, nor are the ding dong , lilting melodies that repeat endlessly.

I slept so well my dog, who eats at 4:30am didn’t get fed until my alarm went off at 11:00! I’m SO glad that commercial aired when I needed help so desperately! Thank you BetterSleep!!

5,2021-12-03 08:33:21,"I find Better Sleep is definitely the best app out there with so many fun and new features added to it on a regular basis.  I basically go into a coma when I have the app on and so do my 3 daughters 😏.  I love that there are consistently new features and studies that have been done to help just about any person fit to work within the app.  Also, I cant ever recall having technical problems or the app force closing, etc.  I’m definitely a number one fan and tell others to give it a try! If they don’t like it, they will most certainly learn something from all of the research and obvious hard work that has been dedicated to this amazing little night time gem! Thanks for all of the amazing options and discoveries to all who make it happen. Can’t imagine nighttime without BetterSleep!",Better Sleep Rating
4,2022-09-06 05:16:24,"I’ve had this app for a while now, and it’s been great. Ever since I’ve started tracking my sleep, I’ve learned some crazy stuff (like my dog snores a lot).   One thing I wish the app had is a reminder section of the sleep journal so you could set reminders for when you wake up, like for example for me, that I have a test or something similar.   Anyway, great app! The sounds are very interesting, and I like all the different stories and stuff that helps with sleep troubles. Sweet dreams with this app!",Great app but I’ve got ideas!
5,2021-08-06 02:21:58,This app is amazing it really is there’s a lot of new features every single day and I usually listen to the melodies melodies help me fall asleep faster and they help me sleep better you can make your own melodies and they’re not lying when they show you the gecko they’re not camping either this is a great app yes could use some fixing because there are a little bit of bugs but other than that if this is an amazing app it really helps you sleep👌👌👌,Great app
3,2021-02-08 16:04:32,"This app has some good sounds including music and natural sounds which you can play at the same time and facilitates meditation. I paid 40$ for yearly subscription which is probably not worth it. I will not renew.  Most of the meditations are geared towards sleep. I don’t really have a sleep problem. The few times I tried it actually kept me up. Some other guided meditations were a bit annoying ; the voice, the pattern of speak sound very pretentious.  After I watched the Headspace Netflix series I have to say Headspace is what I should have purchased to begin with. That one is 70$ a year. Now I have 2 apps.",Not what I expected
5,2020-01-30 04:46:40,I lost my husband 3 years ago in a car accident. I was left with our 3 young children ages 4 and under. The tragedy and daily stresses caused me to have anxiety and panic attacks. Even with medication I struggled to fall asleep. Then I found this app. I was able to create a mixture of sounds that are so relaxing. Now whenever I can’t sleep I play these sounds and fall asleep fast. I am a better mom being well rested. I also appreciate the mindfulness playlists as they are teaching me ways to relax during the day.,Life Changing
5,2018-08-26 10:18:50,"This app does help me with my sleep prevention. It helps me relax an just focusing on the sounds it’s nice instead of my brain wondering around. I also like it becomes you just open the app an some melodies/sounds are all ready fixed for you. And depending on what you need, either for relaxation or a stress free corner, just press a sounds an your in your own zen. You can customize your own sounds to your very own liking. It’s great! Obviously you pay for more sounds but the ones that are free are good too.",My sleep
5,2018-08-03 06:42:02,"I have pretty bad insomnia. There are times that have felt (and been proved accurate by my Fitbit) that I’ve gotten 1 hour of sleep. Using this app (so far) helps my mind focus on relaxation instead of anxiety and I love that its customizable as some sounds work some nights and some nights they need to be switched up. While there is a cost for additional sounds, the app provides more than enough to get by with the free version. Love it!! The crappy fan in my bedroom just  doesn’t do it anymore!",Helps an insomniac!
3,2018-08-22 13:06:16,"I really like this app and all the sounds it gives me—they’re designed well and really relaxing. However, when Relax decided to switch over to being an account based service, they essentially locked all the mixes I made behind a wall. I keep resending the email, but still have yet to see anything in my inbox—or spam—from relax.  I don’t like that they once allowed you to just make and save mixes, then, without warning, just decided to switch. I found it in poor taste, and I still haven’t gotten that confirmation email.   Other than that, I have no problems with it.",Poor Switch Practice
4,2018-08-09 05:59:36,"I really love how you can customize your own soothing music, it's by far the best feature of this app. But if you want to use the meditations you don't have a lot of options. I have only used the sleep category and unless you get the pay or Pro version, you can listen to 2 meditations. I don't remember the exact amount for the pay but I think it's $5.99 a month. I myself can't do that because I'm already subscribe to other things but I can definitely see if you can pay the $5.99 a month, I say go for it! I feel it'd be worth it.",Good but...
5,2018-06-06 02:16:48,"Amazing, Love it, Super relaxing! There are so many choices to pick from! I love how the meditations walk you though the steps! So smart to add timers I used to wake up in the middle of the night hearing the same thing over and over, but with this app you can set a timer for it to stop, now I can get a full night sleep! This app is so helpful I can never sleep or I COULD never sleep now I can, it used to take me a 1 or 2 hours now it takes me 15-45 mins. If I can’t sleep get this app👍🏻!

1,2018-06-25 10:25:22,"Love the app.  I understand the new mixer functionality, but not having the master volume slider on the main screen is a terrible change.  We use this app on multiple devices to help keep our kids asleep.  Nothing is worse than hitting play and the volume is at max!  Sleeping children no more.  Also, the organization of the sounds is a bit odd, takes a bit to search for a specific sound since there doesn’t seem to be any logic to the ordering?  But, keep that the same and return the volume slider!  Response to the dev:   The volume buttons usually control the Sound Effects and not actually the volume.  Not having a visual indicator of the current volume level is poor UX.",Bring back the volume slider!
5,2018-05-14 04:30:50,I’ve custom created my own melody that I listen to every night when going to sleep. I love that there are so many choices and also love that you can save your custom creations! Another feature I love is the timer option. I custom set a 2 hour timer (it takes me a while to fall asleep) and when it’s done it closes the app. This is so nice as I don’t have to worry about not hearing my alarm over the sounds that might otherwise continue to play into the morning.,Wonderful options!
5,2018-04-18 03:04:39,"First of all: WOW! When I downloaded this app, I thought to myself, “this is going to make me subscribe in order for me to play good-quality sounds.” However, when I opened the app and started to explore it, I was amazed!!!  You automatically start out with high-quality sounds, including oceans, rivers, birds, trains, and even soft instruments. You can adjust the sound anyway you’d like, and even create custom mixes! You could always purchase a subscription for more sounds, but you already start out with over 52!   Not even does it have sounds, it also has a meditation section! I use the meditation section almost every night, it helps me relax whenever I’m stressed, or just can’t sleep!  In conclusion, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app to anyone! It is worth the download, best one I’ve found so far. (Not to mention it is very organized)",This app deserves to be #1!
5,2018-03-28 03:03:06,"I use this app all the time!  It helps me fall asleep when I can't shut down my brain in the dark silence.  I've programmed a bunch of favorite sound combinations, pick one that suits my mindset, set the timer, and within minutes I'm fast asleep.  This app has been a life saver as I travel often and deal with jet lag and noisy hotels all the time. Highly recommend!!  Is great for babies and kids too!  Download to your other devices and have a white noise or soothing sound machine where ever whenever!",Love!!! Zzzzzzz
5,2017-09-05 14:14:29,"So far so good. This app is very intuitive and east to figure out. I like the feature that lets you add and edit soothing music playlists from your own music. There are lots of sound options.  You should find a combination of sounds that work for you.  I like to use the rain and add the grandfather clock.  Also there are is a lot of good relaxation/sleep advise in the ""meditations"".

4,2017-07-29 20:41:33,"This app, although comes with its flaws, is amazing, especially if you are looking for sleep sounds, or concentration sounds, or anytime you might need some sounds in the background of your day-to-day routine. The one flaw I find with this app is the fact that you have to pay to get half of the sounds, and although you may need to make revenue somewhere, in-app purchases for an app for relaxing sounds isn't the best way to do that. Eitherway, the app is amazing eitherway, and I strongly suggest downloading it!","If you're looking for sleep sounds, find them here!"
5,2023-08-12 04:31:44,This app has been essential for me to sleep for the past 6 years now. I broke my ankle in 2017 and was bed ridden for months. My sleep schedule got really wonky after a few weeks. Eventually I learned to turn off my thoughts and turn on my sleep sounds for relief. Love the sounds but I really love the stories. The stories really help me quiet my mind and visualize what I am listening to so I drift off into sleep. I hardly ever hear the end of a story or meditation.,Broken and bed ridden.

Also if you are confused there actually are wonderful people who get back to you very soon so guide you to easy solutions. I highly recommend this app.",Never slept better!

You can choose different music and sounds to combine to make the perfect mix for yourself. I usually have difficulty falling asleep and the sleep meditations have been successful in helping me fall asleep and then stay there. If you struggle with sleep, I’d give this app a try. You won’t be disappointed.",I love the customization!
4,2023-03-14 11:29:18,The app does a great job helping me get to sleep! I love all of the sounds and hypnosis and that’s the main reason I went premium was because I enjoyed all the sounds and I just really needed to work on my sleep. My only complaint is you can only see your “journal” one time. If you track it multiple times like for a nap etc it only shows the first time. That is really the only complaint I have about the app hence the 4/5 star rating because other than that it’s wonderful!!!,Only one one complaint
5,2022-05-10 04:11:19,"I’ve been using this app for a while now and honestly, it’s the best app I’ve used for sounds when going to sleep. I use a mix of rain sounds. I play it every night and it’s the only way I can sleep. It drowns out all of the outside noise, which helps me sleep 100x better than when I don’t use it. I got my boyfriend to download it and he uses it to fall asleep now as well! I recommend this to everyone I know who have trouble sleeping.",The best app for sleep

Also Some mixes are not getting uploaded like some are by Your company and so little are by REAL PEOPLE. You also need to add more free stories + meditations  Bugs I have.

1,2020-06-19 08:30:21,"When the individual sounds were accessible this was a great app. Now they are adding all sort of useless bells and whistles (not literally those sounds) and bundles and they charge you for it. Which is fine, if they take the time to put together their own mix of sounds, give it a name and charge you for that, sure. But now they have also locked all the individual sounds so you can no longer make your own good night mix without paying per sound. And they are all generic, public domain sounds fx.  Unlock the individual sounds they way it used to be. You got good ratings and 5 star scores are from the original version.

I do things on my own and do not like to involve friends or family. This app has brought me piece of mind when the out of control events happen. When things are braking, someone is hurting you and you feel all alone close your eyes, put your headset on and control the situation your way. By listening to the melodies you’ll find yourself centered, courageous and powerful.   So I recommend it to anyone. To find your way back when you made need it.

I also like the meditation sessions ( 15 min body scan is my fav ) I really like how you can mix sounds and play multiple sounds at a time. Another two things I like is that one you can let your device shut off while listing to the sounds and two that you can listen to sounds and do the meditation sessions at the same time. My favorite sound is urban rain.,Great app!!!!

I’m really upset about the last update that cancelled the background play while using other apps.  Here’s what’s wrong.  I setup this up for the whole night. Play audiobook for half an hour while still hear the night sounds in the background.  Well... guess what?  I can’t do it anymore.  Please fix it ASAP.  Please don’t advise to change settings or such.  That’s on your end.  And remember: don’t fix it if it ain’t broken.",Last update doesn’t allow to listen to audiobooks
5,2018-10-01 03:40:43,"I’ve listened to many sleep music/sound apps over the last couple years.  This app has, by far, been my favorite app.  I like mixing music with sound or mixing three sounds which this apps lets me do.  Some of my favorites are combining the ocean with music or mixing three together like the ocean, rain and traffic and then mixing it up another night; depends on my mood. There are so many different variations and the sounds aren’t loud and obnoxious like other apps I’ve tried.",Love the different variations
1,2019-06-03 12:47:53,"I really dislike that the basic and “pro” are scrambled together now. I don’t want pro, I never wanted pro, I won’t ever want pro....leave “pro” at the end so I can enjoy scrolling and mixing the basic sounds available to me for free in peace. Now I have to scroll through EVERYTHING to sort through and find what I want! HUGE TIME WASTER!!   .......AND I’ve read so many reviews that talked about losing their in app purchases and the response from the developer is a cut-and-paste about restoring subscription under settings. These people aren’t talking about a subscription they are talking about a one time purchase that you’ve taken away from them...#Fraud #Theft take your pick!  What’s your excuse?!! What are you gonna do about it?!",Awwww man! Not ok guys!!
3,2019-04-01 02:01:29,"There are several very soothing sounds, even in the free version. I also like that you can blend sounds and play it in the background while using other apps.  The only thing I would like to see is better in app volume control. The app does allow for volume mixing, but when I tried to turn down the volume of everything in the app it just turns back up after closing and reopening. As a result, I have to turn down the volume on the phone. Which means I’m turning down the volume on all of my apps. It’s a bit annoying the next time I use my GPS and can’t hear it.",Very Nice Sounds
5,2018-06-20 00:37:54,"RelaxMelodies is called by its name for a reason. Because it helps you RELAX. I mainly have used this at night to go to sleep, and it works great! Unlike other apps, RelaxMelodies has a timer so that it turns off automatically instead of you getting up when you’re done with it and your sleepy, and then turning it off. Also, unlike other apps, RelaxMelodies provides over 100 different sounds that are for FREE Zander no payment is required! RelaxMelodies should be the melody to your sleep. Download it NOW!",LOVE it!
5,2018-05-15 03:18:39,"I can’t say enough great things about this app. I have struggled falling asleep for years and this has been a lifesaver. The sounds available, even without purchasing anything, are high quality and you have so many options available. The combinations are endless and you have the ability to control every detail, as well as extras like setting timers and alarms. I was up searching for something to help me relax on restless nights and this was exactly what I needed. Thank you!!",Fantastic app!!
5,2018-05-04 03:58:29,"There’s a massive variety of sounds, especially if you pay for the extra ones. But even for the free tones, there’s a lot to choose from. I really like how you can change the volume of a particular tone, and how visual it is. It is a little annoying that I have to scroll a fair amount away for different tones, but it’s still very visually appealing. I particularly like the isochronic and binaural beats. There’s a lot of science and studies that have shown effectiveness, and I feel like they work.",I really love the variety
5,2018-01-27 06:39:14,"I began using this app a couple nights ago. I had forgotten to bring my white noise machine with me to housesit, but this app more than makes up for it. The sounds that are available in the free mode are diverse and I love that you can control the volume of each sound individually. This makes mixing sounds and creating your own tracks to relax by a breeze. There are ads in the free version, and not all sounds/features are unlocked, but this hasn't detracted from the app at all for me.",Suits my needs
4,2018-02-05 13:46:58,This serves its purpose well.  Lot’s of sounds and features with entrainment sounds as well. Mix and match. Guided meditations. Makes my favorite wake up alarm as well.   I got this a while ago and they are always adding more and often at a charge. I think they have dramatically increased how much they charge at this point. Also a little random in its organization in mimic of early iPhone app organization before search and folders except that you can’t reorganize and move sounds so you just have to learn we’re they all are.,Always improving.
5,2018-01-02 13:47:22,"I used this app for myself years ago, but didn't need it after I moved to a much quieter neighborhood.  My dog had surgery a couple weeks ago, and being left alone or during the night were the worst times for her. I came home one evening, and she shook for three hours. Nothing calmed her down, until I tried this app. Of all things, the underwater sound transforms her from a quivering ball of fear to a relaxed pup in seconds. The app wasn't  designed for canines, but it has been a godsend for my dog!  Thank you!!! 🐶😊",Calms my dog
5,2023-09-29 09:45:40,Love this app. I mix my own sounds and use them to help me drift off into slumber. I use them for my grandchildren at nap times and sleepovers. My husband has now become accustomed to it so has it on his phone when he’s away for business. I have found it sends me to a calm rest while plane traveling when I cannot get comfortable. I use it during my quiet time in the mornings also.  I’m so happy to have this app that has really made a difference.,Game changer
5,2023-08-23 08:27:04,"I’m a lifetime member, been using this app for years since before they changed their name. It’s always been a good app to help me sleep with a wide range of sounds that’s been updated. Now there’s even more! Such as audio stories and other things like meditation, etc etc.  If you’re looking for an app to help you sleep this one well do great, and you can customize the sounds to have multiple playing at the same time.",Great for sleep
5,2023-07-29 08:21:23,"Being able to set the sounds you want to a track and having the ability to vary the sound level of the components is fantastic. It’s not a cure, but I have found that having the right kind of noise absolutely does help me fall asleep.  I do need to keep my phone charged as I play the track (I play it for the entire duration of my sleep), because it drains my iPhone battery otherwise. Well worth it!",Helps with my insomnia
5,2023-07-21 06:20:21,I love it! I mix rain and cavern and use it every night to help me fall asleep. I’ve tried the stories and they are ok.. not long enough for me to fall asleep and would like mystical stories ore lores or histories but on the darker side… but mostly I wish you could set up your favorite sound mixed to turn on at the end instead of having to do it manually. If that was an option I’d try the stories more often  .But overall.. it’s great!,I love this! I mix rain
5,2023-07-04 11:09:26,This app makes me sleep well and makes me clear my mind and also gives u good sleep and that’s what I like but I would like the things to free because almost all of them u have to purchase it and it’s a waste of money because some apps that make u sleep almost all of them are free but in any other way this app is the best so far and this night I think I would use it again so u people should download it put pls pls pls make more free.,It’s lovely
5,2023-05-11 14:42:33,After trying out the premium I don't think I can go back. The only thing I wish was that in the free version we're able to preview all premium sounds for 20 seconds or less to know if it's worth getting the premium. It would be great also if there was a place on the app or a website to go to so fans can give suggestions of different sounds. I love the stories they are great. This app is a saver. Thank you.,The Best of The Best!
5,2022-10-19 15:24:24,"Hi team- I upgraded to the new version and lost access to my favorite work playlist - Chillhop! Can you please bring it back?   In general - this app is the BEST I’ve found. I’ve used others, but I love the variety of sounds and playlists for different focuses (meditation, all-night soft sounds and white noise, and then I also use it to focus when working on tedious tasks). It’s a game-changer!!  Thank you for making this such an amazing app!",Awesome App with one complaint!
5,2022-07-31 05:48:28,"I have been using Calm for a while but I wasn’t about to pay for it just to hear a sleep story. BetterSleep has more stories that I can listen to and more sounds that I can fall asleep to and just more options in general than any other apps I’ve tried, and for free. There are some things that you have to pay for which I am not doing yet, but this is definitely the best sleeping app I’ve tried.",Definitely helped with my sleep
5,2022-05-16 05:23:59,"This app has helped me get to sleep and stay asleep. I had it downloaded years ago, but when I got my phone forgot to redo load it. I recently download it again and am impressed how much it made a difference. Some nights I just really need background noise to fall asleep, and within 10-15 of this playing in the background, I’m out. I even use it during the day sometimes if I just need to relax and festers.",Incredibly relaxing
5,2022-01-21 04:27:40,"This app is honestly great. You can create your own melodies or get one from the app. It can be so calming to have it on. Recently I’ve been using it to help me sleep better at night and I find that I haven’t woken up as much as I use to, and I have been falling asleep faster. It helps me meditate. I have also put on a track while doing my daily tasks, which has helped with my anxiety and has helped me be calmer. 10/10 recommend",Better sleep
5,2021-03-18 01:18:01,The second I turn on the music it knocks me out like a light if you’re looking at this to see if you should get this you don’t evenHave to read this I just got to tell you if you got bad sleeping problems this will get you the bed it is so good there are even stories and you might be looking you know you’re like man this app does he feel good let me tell you though this app is not good it’s perfect my parents love it and I do so trust me don’t read any more reviews just get the app,This app It’s so good
5,2020-07-19 23:48:14,I’ve been using this app for years now almost every night. Loving the updates and it’s cool to see how far it’s come along! Thanks for keeping it up to date Devs because believe me it’s a life saver XD I was wondering however if you were going to keep the “Yoga” app updated like this one. I use it quite a bit as well as it have exclusive tracks and it’d be a shame to see it fall behind or even be unusable in the future. Thank you again!,Been loving it for years! I do have a question.
5,2019-04-08 03:05:15,"I really love the way this app provides such a large number and wide variety of very high quality relaxation sounds, and then allows you to mix and match as you please, or use their mixes if you prefer.  There are also many guided meditations that I have not had time to explore, as well as tones designed specifically for use with sleep. The amount of material is really awesome. My only problem is finding the time to use it as much as I would like!",Fantastic Relaxation & Meditation Sounds!
5,2018-10-01 03:26:40,"Originally I downloaded this app for an oscillating fan noise for vacation so my wife could sleep. After using the app for over a year now, I love the variety in sounds especially after the most recent update. Plus, the sound bytes are an excellent quality. Can't wait to upgrade [purchase] the app. Great stuff here! Keep improving! Edit: I wish I would have purchased the app when I wrote the original review...now it is exorbitantly priced.","Great sounds app, not just for white noise. Exorbitantly priced."
4,2019-03-06 17:53:49,"Generally, the free version of this is fantastic. It is primarily used for the fan noise to help baby sleep and not hear all the noise in the rest of the house. It’s amazing when it works. Occasionally it’s a bit buggy and closes on it’s own, suddenly making it quiet and waking baby. Other times, random music plays that has not been selected and definitely isn’t background app music playing simultaneously (maybe some ads have music??). Still, even with those glitches, most of the time it’s a great app.",Great app with a couple bugs
5,2018-09-23 03:06:00,So far I have not enjoyed the limited sounds available. So please know this good review is ONLY being given in order to receive the sounds so o can see if it may be a way to find a sound that is enjoyable. The Tibetan bowls sound nice. So far I have pretty much just tried and gone to other apps because o haven’t been able to find something that worked. But they get good reviews by paying people off in hope they may enjoy the app in return...,If I give a good review I get sounds
5,2018-09-19 06:39:09,"This app has really helped my wife and I get better sleep for over a week now. The ability to mix noises and fiddle with their loudness is such a great feature and helps us find soothing sounds we can both really enjoy (She likes the oscillating fan, I love the sound of rain). There are definitely some weird sounds that I can’t imagine anyone finding relaxing enough to fall asleep to, but overall the options are pretty great. Definitely worth a download/text run!",So relaxing
5,2018-08-16 04:03:24,My whole family sleeps with a sound machine and this app is perfect for when we travel. We don’t have to worry about packing a sound machine and hoping it doesn’t get damaged or misplaced during our travels. I downloaded this app 4 years ago when we forgot our sound machine in the hotel room and were already in route to our next destination. I love it so much that it’s replaced our sound machine at home and we use it in our room every night!,Great for traveling
5,2018-07-30 01:24:06,Over the past few weeks it’s been taking me like an hour to fall asleep so I had to do something about because I have to get up early to babysit. I remembered seeing this app of Facebook so I thought I would give it a try and I can’t believe how well this works!! I picked 2 sounds that I liked and set a timer for 10 minutes and every time I’m out before it finishes! I also really like how it closes the app when it’s done so it doesn’t waste my battery.,This really works!!!
5,2018-05-26 03:16:07,"So far, I have really appreciated the app. They have done a great job of providing a variety of different sounds. This allows you to mix and match and customization is a great feature of this app. Plus, I appreciate the quality of sound with each recording. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in a great app with a variety of white noise sounds. I’ve used other apps, but this one I have found to be preferable to others I’ve used.",Variety & Quality
4,2018-07-06 07:12:02,"I’ve had this app on my phone for years, and have always loved it. I am a night shift nurse and use this app to provide white noise to help me sleep during the day. Since the last update, however, whenever I receive a call during the day the app shuts off, causing me to wake up. I have my phone set to do not disturb and have the ringer off but it still causes the app to turn off. This wasn’t the case in the past and I’m hoping it will be corrected in the next update. Aside from this, a great app.",Love this app but recently having issues
5,2018-01-18 04:27:17,"I suffer from insomnia. This app is absolutely magnificent. It lets me customize the sounds I hear so that it's perfectly tailored to me and my sleep. I am still surprised by all of the different sounds I manage to piece together that are wonderful, all the different options of compositions I have to choose from each night, and how effective all of them are. Brilliant idea, beautiful design, and clearly professional implementation. I wouldn't give it 5 stars if it didn't totally deserve every one of them.",Perfect
3,2023-10-05 10:07:57,"I had this app subscription months ago and then cancelled it. Then I came back to see if it had some frequency sounds I was looking for. I tried out the week long free trial but didn’t end up using it and forgot about it. Then I was charged for the year subscription and Apple says I’m not eligible for a refund even though I contacted them within 10 mins of being charged saying I didn’t want the subscription. It’s a $50 waste. The app is pretty good, but just doesn’t have what I want so I don’t use it.","Forced to pay for the year, Apple won’t refund me"
5,2023-09-20 02:04:51,"I love this app for travel. Hotels can have unexpected noise at random times. Rented homes sometimes don’t have clocks or alarms in bedrooms. This handles both. I set a nice background noise on low and then display the clock which has a dimmer option so it’s not too bright. At work if I need to decompress, I listen to a favorite sound combo or a guided meditation. Fits multiple needs and has a lot of sound options and you can combine them!",Great sound machine for travel
5,2023-08-03 09:23:10,"I really like how you can create custom mixes. I also really like the Sleep Tales, although one suggestion I’d make is to have a slightly better organization for the list of stories. It can be hard to find a specific tale at times. It would also be nice to have interactive links for the authors…so you could click on the author name and see a list of the other stories they narrate. Otherwise, I’m very pleased with this app.",Loving it so far!
5,2023-03-23 02:26:07,The app asked for a review after the first night of the trial period. So far I can say that I like the fact that sounds can be layered for ultimate results. I also like all the noise choices because music and other recordings just get my mind thinking more than resting. After using the combo of brown noise and deep brown noise I had a 94 sleep score on another health app that I use. That’s impressive since I’ve been averaging 74 scores. So far so good.,First night success
4,2023-07-31 05:11:38,"It’s pretty good for playing white noise while you sleep and the alarm wakes me up better than any other, i don’t wake up with a bunch of fog feeling groggy, and my dreams are much more vivid when i fall asleep with this app, however the sleep tracker is pretty bad, it says I’m awake multiple tiles throughout the night when I’m sure I’m asleep, not sure what causes this because it didn’t start happening until a month into using the app, but it’s overall a pretty good app",Use it every night
4,2023-07-25 10:59:17,Well what can I say!!! There are lots of traps with using this app. I have enjoyed using the white noise for the past 10 years or so. I don’t need any of the bells and whistles ( pun intended) so it would have been nice to have been left alone without all the unnecessary noise ( pun again intended) Thank you for reaching out to me. I upgraded your score to a 4 out of 5 (from a 3). I do enjoy your app but please keep the efforts to make me use other elements of your interesting app to a minimum.  So far so good,Was great but not so much now
1,2023-07-17 06:01:02,"Granted this app helps me fall sleep, BUT it literally drains the life out of phone if I forget to turn it off before actually falling asleep. That's pretty crazy to me. I have literally woken up to a dead phone on the charger. My phone gets hot with app being left open. Then when it does to I have to do a number of “tricks” just to get to charge and get my phone to turn back on. When I have it on and my phone is off the charger it quickly drains my battery so imagine the frustration of trying to go to sleep and potentially overseeing because of the app that's supposed to help you sleep. Yeah, it helps drain the life out of my phone for sure.",This app has almost destroyed my phone
5,2023-01-16 02:59:38,"I started using this app for myself, since I start thinking about the next days tasks as I crawl into bed. I used to try soothing music, it was sort of effective after 15 or 20 minutes. With this app I have enjoyed the voices telling a story the most. There are sounds of nature too, I have tried both. Since it worked well for me I started using it when I babysit. Which really helps promoting longer naps. I like it so far!",Soothing stress
5,2022-11-17 03:33:06,There are such a great variety of sounds and the fact that you can build the sounds on top of one another to make your own sleep playlist is very cool. It truly becomes a melody that’s just right for you. I have several playlists that are unique with a few sounds in each. I love to fall asleep to one and utilize the timer so it doesn’t play all night. I’ve really enjoyed the app.,Very relaxing and the best sleep app I’ve found
5,2022-06-08 05:46:02,"I have just started using this app and so far, it really does help me sleep fast and STAY asleep. I have used other apps like Calm as well. While I love that one for more Day-Time meditation, this one seems to have better sleep meditations (no pun intended). I would definitely recommend giving this a try if you have difficulties like I do with your brain saying, ""Let's sleep....JUST KIDDING! We're going to be awake for HOURS flipping our body like hotcakes on a griddle!""",Best Sleep App Yet!
5,2022-01-21 05:14:44,"Awesome app that I have been using for a while, highly recommend. I have been using it for quite a few months now. My only issue is that after a while listening to the same stories and meditations and sounds gets boring. Some people don’t have the money to spend on an expensive payment option. I’m not saying to make everything free. Just please please pleaseee add some new free stuff, especially the sounds.",Great app
2,2022-03-29 09:20:58,"Previously I had four stories unlocked, since I don’t have the subscription. Am really frustrated that the story about the highland giants is now locked, the only one I use. The only one still unlocked is the one I don’t like the most, which just adds to the annoyance. Worst part I could find one other free story, so I went from four options to two. I left my previous sleep app because of all my favorite stories being locked behind a subscription without a heads up, or a say in at least keeping one story. I love the app. I just hate the sudden changes","Great, but my stories are now locked"
4,2022-02-02 12:42:03,"New tracks are added frequently, which is great, but I prefer longer tracks as I take a while to fall asleep. I skip past any tracks less than 45 minutes because I know I will still be awake. Please add more longer tracks! I’ve been using this app for years and keep replaying the collection of longer tracks and hoping for some new material.  Updated to respond to developer: Sorry, I should have been clearer! I personally love the longer stories. :)",Need more longer tracks.
5,2018-09-19 10:57:36,"This app has been amazing. I have used it for many years and it has been such a great investment. This app stands out the most out of any I’ve used. With customization of sounds and the ability to set timers for auto-turn off this app has helped me get to sleep after the long hours of studying in college, to the busy work life post-graduating, and now the hectic life of parenthood. This is my favorite sleep aid for when sleep just doesn’t want to settle in.",Long time user Very satisfied.
4,2018-11-16 07:02:44,"Upon the update, I, like many others, lost my subscription. But I just poked the “restore purchase” button and it came back! Minus a few mixes, but I only really used the one anyway, so it’s not a big deal. I just can’t believe the current price for the subscription, glad I bought it when it was $10! I will admit I cried when seeing the new sub price before restoring my purchase, worried I’d have to pay. But no other app has worked like this one has, so I would have used the free version had I not figured out how to restore.",Perfect-ish.

I recommend to anyone who mentions problems with sleep! I marked 4 stars because they have sounds that you must pay for in order to use. While I understand many apps have this “feature “, I do not care for it. When this app started out, it was not built that way. Still a great app with many options!",Great app

There is already an advertisement on the bottom of the screen, now you’re going to close your app and take me to some crappy advertising website? Close it, return to the app just for it to do it again before I could select a third sound! I don’t mind occasional advertisements but when I can’t even get the app set up.

When life slams you down, kicks you to the curb & then runs you over; finding this app was a total God send. I’m completely grateful that it’s available and, maybe there will come a time; when I can afford the premium version. Until then, this is a nightly ritual, the same as saying my prayers as I have for 60 years. 😊","Cancer, COVID, Corporate & Cyber Crap"
5,2021-01-20 13:32:32,"I’m the kind of person who takes forever to sleep and has racing thoughts when my head hits the pillow. I decided to try out an app but I still wasn’t relaxed at all. After a month I tried again to use an app, this one. I played the spaceship one and fell asleep pretty quickly after I found the right volume. I woke up energized but unfortunately very late because I’m stupid😅. That’s my own fault so 5 stars. I might buy the full version soon.","Very satisfied, Slept like a baby!"
5,2018-12-08 09:45:13,Awesome app that has literally changed my life.  I grew up in a house where we had a fan running outside my bedroom door my entire childhood which resulted in me becoming addicted to not being able to sleep without a fan.  This made traveling extremely difficult to carry a regular size box van with me but once I discovered Relax Melodies is cured me of having to take my fan with me because it has a fan and rain sound that I use at the same time and absolutely love.  Thank you❤️😴,Relax Melodies
3,2019-10-03 04:35:25,One of my most used functions was completely wiped in the last update without warning!! I had my timers set to turn off my sounds at particular times in the morning. It was like a reverse alarm clock. I think it was called the clock timer. One of the most useful features ever! Please bring it back! It allowed me to stop sounds at a certain time every morning which allowed for a more natural waking up.  Another weird random thing it does sometimes is stop playing sounds without warning! It never did that before!,Newest Version Wiped My Clock Timers & No More Clock Timer Option 👎
5,2018-11-02 05:23:00,"I’ve used this app for years and I love it. It’s easy to mix the sounds you like to get exactly what you’re feeling for that evening.  I love having the sleep timer on it too! I notice the “patterns” of sounds a lot when they’re recordings being looped and for the most part that isn’t an issue on this app. ( a few I notice, but it’s be hard to make certain sounds and not notice the loop). In the end I’m out like a light when I put this on.",Easy to use and sound asleep
5,2018-09-03 05:43:48,I bought the full version after using the free one for a while. It has so many great features! I use it all the time. The guided meditation is pretty awesome. There are so many options. You can layer 12 sounds at custom volumes. It's a must have. It helps me get to sleep every night. Plus it has super awesome alarms that you can have exit the app or turn on the app. Oo and bonus the app plays in the background. So you can meditate and read mantras at the same time without it exiting.,Love this app!
5,2018-08-02 03:21:54,I recently just got a German Shepherd puppy and I used to have this app before. Turns out that my puppy absolutely loves this. It helps him get more sleep and that in turn gets me more sleep.  Thank you relax melodies for helping me and my puppy get more sleep. There’s also helps me a lot with homework. I always listen to stress relieving music while I’m doing my homework. And this is just one of the best ways that I can get that music into my own preference because I can make my own playlists.,Sleeptastic and Dog Approved
5,2018-02-20 08:12:40,"It’s interesting and wonderful that an app and its creators can take a concept so straightforward as mixing sound bytes and convert it into such a viable, successful source of relaxation. That I can so easily combine a collection of sounds and songs to fit my every feeling and mood is such a useful tool for my well-being. I use it in visualization exercises, script-writing, emotion processing, and more. A truly versatile and elegant solution to so much more than just sleep. I’ll be using this for a long time to come.",Beautifully Simple
5,2017-07-28 04:46:30,Love this app! This is one of my favorite apps. I don't use it only for sleep. Sometimes I use it when I'm reading it helps me concentrate and when I'm studying as well. I love how you can create your own mixes. My two favorite mixes I created was city magic and at the beach. You can adjust the volumes for each of the sounds and customize to your liking. I have  one mix that I often use for meditation as well. I run this app several times a day as it transports me somewhere different.,Great app.
4,2017-11-12 20:10:44,"Owned only 2 weeks but using multiple times daily and each night to help with insomnia.  My only suggestion is I wish I could build the melodies so that certain sounds would be on for a certain period of time (specifically the isochronic tones or binaural beats) then switch to a different sound or sounds.  If this is possible, I haven’t found it yet . . . . But in the two weeks I’ve used both the relax melodies and relax meditation, that’s my only recommendation for both.  Otherwise, I find them both very helpful.",Relax melodies

This app is such a good app I very much recommend it to anyone all ages recommended!!!!! this app has changed my life!",It helps me go to sleep faster!
5,2022-10-22 07:13:20,I started using this app around 2014. At that time it had various sounds and I always listened to it while working. It helped me to concentrate. Slowly the app improved and added so many new and different materials. I have to say I like most of the offerings but my favorite is definitely the night time stories. I would like to thank the team who are behind this amazing app. You guys really made my life better🙂😌,Long time friend
3,2023-01-11 17:59:49,"I’m disgusted . I had my playlist that I used for 4 months, without fail. I opened the app last night to find it is gone! They tried to congratulate themselves that I had been given an entirely new program of sounds and music and moods, and I spent 20 minutes trying to get something I could tolerate. I failed. By then I was so angry I couldn’t sleep! I paid for a year and now think I need to get a refund for 2/3 of my $60. I’ve looked for a way to contact ipnos with no luck. Ridiculous and disgusting. I’ll be looking for a new app and will pay monthly.",Lost

Then we realized even our $200 sound machine didn’t have even half the choices this app does, and no way to mix and match so many. We’ve used it for, I think, 8 years now for sleep, meditation, or to block out ambient noise while we’re working. Try it!",So many sounds to choose from!
5,2021-11-04 05:03:53,I have had trouble sleeping for years. Insomnia for days sometimes with no rhyme or reason. This app is extraordinary in helping me rest. I love the bed time stories. Funny. I seldom make it to the end of one tho. They put me right to sleep. Also the meditation for settling into the present moment. That one really centers me. I love that I can make my own playlists of sounds and the wide array of varieties to choose from. All in all I am very pleased with this app.,This app is perfect for me.

I remembered that, once upon a time a few years back, I’d used this exact same app to help me destress and fall asleep. Hoping that it was still in the App Store, I searched it up and - well, I found it! Seeing how much it’s changed since I last used it was definitely a welcome surprise. If I can comfortably get the money for it, I want to invest in the premium version.",Comforting

Not only is going to sleep now the most interesting thing in my day, but I am able to successfully block out my horrible neighbor’s loud television with the most fun white noise mixes on the planet. Today I have dramatic music topped with shushing baby, elvish whispers, owls, whales, gulls and forest sounds. Can’t stop smiling. Would love an option to make long story mixes and hope new stories keep coming. Really the best app I’ve ever downloaded.",Can’t Rave Enough

This is unlike any other app I’ve tried, I love that it has a timer so I can fall asleep to it and not worry about it draining my phone battery or waking me up later in the night. It is very calming and it has greatly impacted my sleep hours(in a good way😉)I would definitely recommend this to others, it is truly a great app😊",Love it!
4,2021-05-22 03:38:09,"I find that this app has greatly improved my sleep, I use it every night. It used to take me a long time to get to sleep, but when I started using this app, I started to fall asleep in just a few minutes. The only reason I took off a star is because the full version is so expensive. $70 per year is a bit ridiculous. If it were less expensive, or if they released more free content, I would definitely give it five stars.","Great app, definitely recommend it"
3,2019-11-01 11:01:56,"I loved this app in the beginning! I need some noise to sleep at night and there were a lot of great sound options available, even with the free version. However, for the past two weeks, I set the timer for the app to close after seven hours, but every night the app ends up crashing after a couple of hours and never actually works for the period of time I set it. It’s frustrating to wake up in the middle of the night to find the app not working. If this glitch gets fixed, I would definitely give the app five stars.","Great App, But Keeps Crashing at Night."
4,2019-01-16 11:28:17,"Just got this app and bought the discounted lifetime subscription. Seems like a keeper. I wish this app would allow me to adjust how frequent a sound is played. A good example of something like this is Taomix 2. It allows your soundscapes to be played randomly, or have it follow a small ball and the sound of the soundscape is different as it travels.  I wish this app had that feature.  Thanks for this amazing app! Other than Taomix, I don’t think there’s any other app like this out there, especially of this quality.",Very great sound design

UPDATE I submitted a one star rating but I found another review with developer response explaining how to restore your past purchase. Following their advice I was just able to restore my access to what I had paid for.

Work wonders for babies too! They've added so many great sounds over time and I love all the concentration and calming beats you can listen to as well. I would definitely recommend the download.

If there's anything I'd complain about it's that I wish the riffs on the musical type sounds were a little longer they're only a few seconds long at the most so it's very repetitive (maybe this is one done way on purpose to help lull you to sleep, I don't know), but when it's taking me a while to get to sleep it's a little boring/frustrating.",Good product

I suffer from adhd and insomnia so changing up the mixes has been so phenomenal for me. Would definitely recommend,Finally found a great sleep app
4,2023-02-24 18:15:28,This app is great and I use it for myself and my family all the time. I love that I can make my own mixes to customize our atmosphere for napping/sleeping and even playtime. My ONLY complaint is that I can’t customize the frequency or speed of the sounds that I add to my mixes. For example if I add chimes or birds to a mix I wish that I could make it so that I only hear those sounds every 30 seconds instead of every 2 seconds. I really hope they add this type of feature soon.,ALMOST perfect

I’d pay good money to unlock everything once, but it’s not worth the annual bill. Still, amazing even with the free stuff.",Just enough to be great
3,2022-09-25 02:40:31,"I love the concept of this app but there are a few things getting in its way for me to gain its full potential. The app picks up my air conditioner’s noise over 50 times a night. On top of that, it’s picking up my girlfriends snoring throughout the night so it’s not an accurate reading for my sleep. I love the options you can use for a better nights sleep with the variety of calming sounds. I can’t take full advantage of this unless I’m sleeping alone and in a completely quiet environment which won’t happen because my AC is on every night.","Nice, but not for me"

There are so many different sound variations, it's nice to be able to listen/add different ones at the same time. If you're looking for a good background noise app, this one is by far one of the best in my opinion. Definitely plenty of options, and you can set a timer for it to turn itself off.",Perfect

I normally sleep with my fan on for the noise just because the house creaks and settles and freaks me out sometimes. The first time I tried this it worked. And has been since then.

Very neat and such a great idea for an app. Perfect for everyone in the family who has trouble sleeping or if a parent is away (or not) and wants to hear a bedtime story from their favorite actor/actress too!,Great Sleeping App
5,2021-06-16 16:15:47,"Told me it would give me the Tibetan bowls that I wanted if I gave it a review. So I gave it a good review to get the Tibetan bowls that I previously used to have? I don’t know why i used to have it and it was taken away, maybe they find out what you like and take it away unless you upgrade or some thing. Anyway I gave it a review and it gave me some other crappy sounds I didn’t want. I am going to delete it because it’s messing with my mind.",Deleting
5,2021-03-26 06:15:25,"This app is amazing. You can pick and choose which sounds you want,alter the volume of each one, save favorites, and even set a sleep timer where the app will shut off after a set amount of time. They offer a paid version but I don't even think it's necessary because I love the options they already have. There are also meditation you can list to! I seriously think everyone should have this app on their phone.",Best noise app out there
3,2021-06-13 07:40:49,"I use this app every night to cut out extraneous noises when I go to sleep. If I don't use it I have a hard time falling asleep and I tend to focus on every little sound. I can turn this up loud enough to drown out distracting noise and it helps me stay asleep. Nice clear sound without a lot of hissing (like some other apps). I'm very happy with this!! What I am NOT happy about is the constant asks for a review that I’ve already done! So because it’s highly annoying I’m revising my review and taking 2 stars. Devs, knock it off!",Use it every night! You will be pleased!
2,2021-06-11 11:04:06,"I just recently downloaded this app and it has a great catalogue of sounds that are soothing. One thing I’ve noticed is that if you exit the app while the timer is running IT WILL STAY ON ALL NIGHT, instead of shutting off after the 30 minutes I had set to help me fall asleep. This caused my phone battery to drain completely 2 nights in a row, waking up to a completely dead phone... Luckily I was able to wake up naturally for work without my alarms or I could have been in big trouble🙄 I don’t know if this is a bug or what.. but it should really be fixed. Major inconvenience.","Great App, but One Issue"
3,2021-05-31 14:59:08,"I used to love crafting my own mixes - now I can’t even find the controls for choosing & adjusting mix components (I assume that’s because the FREE version no longer lets you). Night Sounds, the only canned track I am really interested in using, is basically rain + crickets, which would be great for me - except that they’ve sped up the crickets so they don’t sound at all real any more and it’s no longer relaxing to listen to! Way to ruin a great product in the quest to make more money guys!",Used to be much better - very disappointed in the changes!
5,2020-09-11 02:58:40,"So this app is great and I would totally recommend it to anyone having trouble sleeping like me, but the one thing I want, is a larger variety of free sounds stories etc, and also a lower price on premium because I don’t wanna pay 60$ to sleep, I mean come on, that’s a little pricy, but still a great app and is worth five stars despite its minor faults (in my opinion) so I would definitely recommend this app!",Amazing app!! One thing to change tho...
5,2020-02-02 13:57:02,It’s a good app it’s just that you have to pay for everything and just to be a member you have to pay $30 a month but my favorite part is that you can share your mix’s with your friends or family but I have this app a 5 star rating because it it is soooo  fun to use at sleep overs or just any time of the day I think its the best sleep app I’ve ever tried and probably the only one I’ve ever tried that actually works and makes me fall a sleep,5 star app
5,2019-04-16 05:03:15,"Have been using this app for years across all my devices, both for personal use and for nap time in my preschool classroom. I recommend to all my friends because it’s simply the best! Great layout, cute and calming designs, huge variety of sounds, etc etc: seriously, the best. I’ve just watched the app get better and better over the years, and they now have all kinds of cool features included as well like the bedtime meditations which I use every night! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",Love love love!
5,2018-10-23 02:21:27,There are plenty of relaxing sounds to choose from and sound melodies to create yourself or select from premade ones. My favorite is the purring sound for when I’m away from home and can’t sleep without my cats. L I like the timer feature so that I can drift off to sleep without worrying about draining my battery in the night. I haven’t even begun to explore all of the features of the app but I can’t wait to try them.,"Lots of sound options, features"
5,2018-10-20 03:20:44,"I love the way that you can customize your own sounds right down to the volume level of each individual sound. It is great that you can save the mixes you have made and the guided meditations are fantastic. I love the app for while I sleep and for helping my son relax when his adhd has him over stimulated. Also, when I am stressed out at work I can go to my car and take 10 minutes to listen to a guided meditation. I highly recommend the app.",I love this app.
5,2018-10-12 03:20:33,I love this and it makes me fall sleep so fast and I love the parts and profiles we can make and I love the sounds like the nature of the music but I really wish you could unlock all fun yeah but it’s really really really really easy to fall sleep with this song I love it thank you for making this app I literally would uses every single day but I cannot fall asleep sometimes and then went to  bed I am so sleepy I am so happy that I have on my parents will never get me a sound machine,Amazing
5,2018-09-03 03:24:26,"I purchased the full lifetime package of this app in January 2018 and it is not working for me now. When I open it, it’s telling me I can upgrade to the Pro edition, which I’ve already purchased. Please help...😞  Update⚡️ The developer immediately contacted me and helped me get this issue resolved. I have full access again and am now on my way to relaxing tones for sleep or any time I need to chill. Thank you! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Five stars for customer service as well as the app. 😃",Full package not working (UPDATE)
5,2018-08-16 03:45:52,"I use the app at night because a train whistles loudly at all hours. I find that the sounds are nice and there is a large variety to choose from. I want to try the concentration binaural sound, but haven't tried it yet. Great app! I recommended it to a friend after someone recommended it to me.  The white noise helps my newborn sleep also.  I love that you can switch to the home screen and the app continues playing. So the room can be dark.  Really great! Highly recommended!",Great app!
5,2018-07-08 06:07:37,"Brings me to my zen places, anywhere, anytime. Much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Sounds are high quality, and being able to control the volume of different sounds in the mix is really great! Thanks for an awesome relaxing app! Makes a great accompaniment to my reading moments (great while reading my kindle, as background atmosphere). Truly enhances my R&R moments. And helps me fall asleep at night too! I bought the premium version and love it!",Highly enjoyable and very relaxing
5,2018-06-25 13:17:59,"I have always had trouble clearing my mind to go to sleep. I only use this when my husband is away, but it works like a charm every time. I am often asleep before the end of the meditation. The timer device to turn off the music is helpful! I have it set at 18:00 and almost never ever am still awake when the sounds stop. I really like the variety of soothing sounds. This has really truly helped me sleep better. I definitely recommend it.",Good night!
5,2018-05-17 05:58:43,"I have never tried meditation before, honestly I thought it was a bit of bologna, until I had trouble sleeping one night and I tried it out. I was asleep before the mini session was over. I had a different rain app before but this one surpasses it by leaps and bound. I truly recommend giving it a try and this is a review without me having all the app’s features. May 16: still love this app and it puts me right to sleep, also helps drown out my horrid fan noise",It does the job
1,2018-05-18 03:56:13,"I've used this app for years and it's been amazing. The most recent update, however, has reversed all the aspects of the app I enjoyed. The app now no longer works unless you are on internet. It also does not auto save the last sound you listened to and it doesn't actually store your mixes for easy re-access. These two issues now require you to go back through all the noises and re-mix and superimpose the sounds. It takes a long time and is frustrating compared to how easy and smooth the previous edition was. I feel that these changes are to encourage people to pay for the pro version, which I will not be doing.",Bad update- lost all the good features of the app
5,2018-03-06 06:00:13,"I have been using the free version of this app to see if I like it before I spend money on it. I have used other white noise apps, but haven’t had much luck with them. The customizability of this app has so far really helped me get to sleep. If I find am starting get used to a sound and it’s losing its effectiveness I can just switch part or all of the sounds. If this app keeps working the way it has for me I will definitely be buying this app.",Very happy with the app.
5,2017-10-18 02:09:53,We had our grandkids overnight in a new travel trailer and they wanted their usual app that plays white noise - I went through and this was the app they have at home ! Out of all the apps I guessed just which one it was.  I enjoyed listening to all the various sounds in your app. The sounds are true and clear - soothing their little minds into lala land. I now listen to it myself and my preschool daycare children listen at naptime. Thank you for making such an enjoyable app. God Bless You!,Comforting and calming!
5,2017-07-14 04:04:40,One of the better sound apps I've used. I never thought about putting sounds on top of other sounds. Most night apps just let you pick 1 out of 6 sounds to play and a lot of time they aren't even good. The extra meditation setting is also nice. I don't use its lot but when I do it is very nice. Glad I have this app. The free version is a highly fair deal with what you get. I will definitely keep using this app. No glitches so far. No problems. Great sounds.,Great app
5,2023-09-08 01:07:43,"You know I love the calm music in this app and it’s really helped me fall asleep. As a student in school I get very stressed about things, But this app helps me feel more at ease. I recommend downloading this app especially because of the little storytelling to help you fall asleep. It’ll make you feel so sleepy!!! As long as you keep using this app, You’ll fall asleep faster and have an amazing time throughout the day. Thanks BetterSleep! <3",✨It’s a life changer!!!!✨
5,2022-10-12 02:12:32,"I tried the premium trial version for about a week, and it basically does what I hoped it would do. I’m able to fall asleep and for the most part sleep through the night. Without it I was using the sound of tv and an air purifier for constant noise. Sleep without a blue screen is so much better. It feels better. Honestly, I’m shocked at how quickly and only in a weeks time, I’m enjoying the results.",Great first week
1,2023-01-24 04:17:19,Cancelled subscription after issues with AirPlay in iOS 16. Playing sounds through a connected speaker no longer works and whatever they decide to put at the top of the app autoplays every time when attempting AirPlay. I don’t like things autoplaying that I didn’t select and I only use AirPlay for connected audio meaning the app is essentially useless to me now.  Avoid using this app or subscribing if you are expecting the app to support AirPlay for playing sound mixes from the sound library. It doesn’t work and the app has been updated with no improvement to this issue.  Review will be updated if the developer decides to address this.,AirPlay Broken
3,2022-11-12 05:08:05,"I had downloaded this app quite a few years ago (2013-ish maybe) and replaced it with an actual noise maker. Since moving and all my stuff being in boxes, I needed something in the interim so I looked at my past downloads and saw this app. This version or name or whatever, has a bunch of mediocre noises with nearly all of the frequencies being paid for. There’s no way I’d ever spend $50 just to unlock the frequencies when the price justifies all of the other noises/features that I’d never use. So, 3 stars on account of the high price.",Meh
5,2022-09-25 12:57:30,"This app is amazing if you are looking for an app that makes it easy to fall asleep. This app has basically everything! It has everything from asmr sounds, wildlife sounds, nature sounds, birds chirping, crackling fire, etc. The vinyl crackle and the campfire sounds are my favorites! Some of the sounds are locked and you have to pay for them, but a ton of the other sounds are unlocked. Best app I could ever have for sleep sounds!",Best Sleep app
5,2022-03-29 03:48:47,"I’ve had this app for years and it only gets better with time. I love that i can build my own sound combinations to sort my every mood and need.

Anyone can find satisfaction relaxation and even pleasure from the large variety on available content free or paid.",Something for EVERYONE
5,2022-03-15 18:44:25,"BetterSleep has been the go to evening noise generator for my daughter since it was originally Relax Melodies. She loves to build her own custom soundscapes from the great selection. The addition of meditation and other content just adds to the value. Plus, the customer support is fantastic as they worked with me to get the premium features for my daughter without needing my Apple ID to be loaded on her iPod.","Great sound selection, outstanding customer support"
5,2021-10-07 16:30:52,"Love this app so much! I’ve been using it for five years to soothe my grandsons to sleep. Works like a dream. I love that you can create multiple combinations of sounds and save them as a mix.  The mix I use for them is a combination slow waves, wind in trees, wind chimes and music box. There are so many sounds, the possibilities are endless. I also like that you can set a timer for as long as you like it to play. I highly recommend this app.",So relaxing
3,2022-01-08 09:52:44,"The app is great in that it has a ton of really cool sounds, stories and meditations. I've been using the pro version for a while now and I have to say the most frustrating thing is that there is often times no sound when I want to play a meditation. I click the button, it looks like it's playing (the count is going) but the circle doesn't advance and there's no sound. This has happened too frequently and I will discontinue paying for what doesn't always work when I need it.",Doesn't always work
5,2021-05-20 03:52:12,"My husband snores horribly. I have anxiety and insomnia. For the first time in a really long time I have been able to sleep thanks to this app and my sleep headphones. I love the stories to fall asleep to. There is great variety, and the narrator’s voices are so soothing. The feature that lets you keep the stories running all night on loop is great. When I wake up in the middle Of the night, the stories remind me I’m supposed to be asleep. Thank you Relax Melodies!",Best app ever!
4,2021-08-15 15:18:34,I have free subscriptions to calm and headspace through work but I paid for a lifetime subscription to Relax Melodies and have been using it for years. I track my sleep too and I typically fall asleep in 10 min or less while listening to these meditations (my fav are the hypnosis ones) and my quality of sleep is usually in the 80% range. The meditations and brainwave sounds just sets this app apart. I rave about this app to my friends. Thanks for helping me improve my sleep!,Better than Calm and Headspace
5,2021-05-02 07:24:43,"I never leave my phone behind on any sort of travel because this sound app is amazing. Blocks out any kind of annoyances possible, whether a quick trip or a weeklong vacation. Saves us money on rooms otherwise rated “noisy” you don’t even hear the stomping or screaming and any “weird” noises. I’ve had people next door in hotels getting VERY romantic and you don’t even notice after you turn on the relax melody app.",Best Sound App EVER!!
5,2020-08-07 19:13:40,"I often have trouble sleeping at night due to my own thoughts. I usually can never sleep any time before 3AM and it takes me at least an hour or so to fall asleep fully. My friend recommended I try this app and just on the first night of trying my own mix of sounds, I fell asleep within minutes (which is something I can never usually do). This app is great and I’m glad it’s free and has no interruptions!! Love the timer too.",Great app and highly recommend!!
5,2018-10-07 05:38:56,"My husband and I must travel too often for medical treatments which are exhausting. The hotels, hospitals, etc are challenging to get any peaceful sleep. Having this app helps dial things down for a calming & comforting nights’ rest. It provides a simple interface to create endless combinations of sounds making it perfect for every need.   I especially like the multitude of nature sounds available so we can bring our country comforts with us on every trip.",Hooked on this app
5,2018-09-02 03:23:51,"I have not been able to get a good night for almost a year before I downloaded this app! People have suggested getting machines and seeing a Doctor, but honestly who wants to take a pill to sleep, with the possibility of still waking up or oversleeping. But then I found Relaxing Melodies, and OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST APP EVER! I can pick what I want to hear, for how long and even awake to something relaxing!! If you haven’t downloaded this app what are you waiting for. Your greatest night sleep Is awaiting you!!!",Best App Ever
5,2018-07-29 05:54:01,I love this app so much it’s helped me fall asleep peacefully after a long stressful day and also has all different settings and allows you to choose multiple nature sounds and combined it all into one and I think that’s what I love most about it but I also use the app for meditation and they also have a meditation slide just for meditating it’s awesome best app I’ve ever downloaded even better than social media because at least with this one I can go to sleep stress free😴 NO ADS AT ALL,The Best
5,2018-05-25 05:11:03,"Amazing app and the sounds are many and the variety is amazing! I like the flexibility of being able to bring the volume up or down for each particular sound. I also love the varied alarms that you can set, I have a bedtime alarm and it turns off at the exact time I need it to.  I use this app every night, wonderful and amazing app and sounds.  thank you for producing this and for the recent upgrade, Love the new layout.",Amazing app and sounds! Helps me get to sleep!
4,2018-06-09 08:02:32,"A wide selection of natural, animal and bird, human contrived and ‘music’ that can be modified and integrated in a multitude of ways.   Add a little birdsong, mix in a little slow ocean wave, perhaps some breeze in the leaves. Top it of with a gentle guitar solo adjusted in volume to be a background melody.   You can let your imagination dictate the soundtrack of your dreams.   Added to this are programs for relaxation, sleep and meditation.   You can set the app for a two hour playtime while you are relaxing into a goodnight sleep. The app will then go to sleep as well.   My only thought that would make the app better would be to be able to adjust the frequency of when a sound comes in.   For instance, having the sound of the ‘cat’s purr’ play for 5 to 10 minutes then be silent for 15 then play again.   But all in all, it has been a pleasure to use this app.",An excellent creative sound designer app.
4,2018-05-28 22:20:40,"This app is by far one of my favorites. Unlike some other apps i have tried, it has a lot of sounds and meditations to use even if you dont buy a pro subscription. Ads are not annoying and usually dont take up too much space on the screen unless you follow the link. Although the alarms aren’t always the best at waking me up, i still recommend this app to anyone with trouble falling asleep at night or who are generally fond of sleep music and meditation apps. This is a really good app! 😝😴😝",Relax melodies is my favorite sleep aid app
5,2018-05-22 03:12:43,My daughter plays this on her iPad with the sounds she chooses and she’s asleep in no time . I choose my own sounds on my phone and use the meditation ones sometimes and I always wake up feeling so much better and my daughter is even having easier mornings waking up . I bought the rest of the sounds because we love going through each one picking different combos . Thank you so much for giving us better sleeping experiences!,Couldn’t be more perfect
5,2018-05-18 08:02:29,"Pros Easy to use. Beautiful interface. Overall good themes for melodies. Featured mixes from community. Expanding collection of guided meditations with themes. Reasonable pricing options. Save your favorite mixes. Alarm clock with fade in option and personal mix option. Clock screen with adjustable brightness. Binaural beats and isochronic tones. Good variety for free version. Locked pro features visible for easy comparison. Enticing gift for rating app.  Cons Some recordings could be improved for clarity.   Comments: Usually gets me to sleep in more or less 15 minutes with meditations and my personalized melodies. Helps me fall back to sleep fast when I wake in the night. Would love to see some of the sound options from Ipnos Software, Inc.’s Relax M.S. app on this app. Would also be cool to have short previews of a few  of the other meditations.",Great App.
4,2018-05-20 08:29:59,"Interface could be A little more user-friendly.  But better than a lot of similar apps.  I would like to see it have a separate volume from your phone.  The way it is now if you turn down the volume of the sleep sounds, it turns down your whole phone and if you get an important call or text you might miss it because your volume is turned down.   But even with this stuff, it’s very usable, fairly easy to use and has a enough sounds that really helps me sleep...",Decent app
5,2018-02-01 06:50:21,"In a pinch, I found myself staying in an unfamiliar sleep setting and in absolute silence. At my house I usually have a fan going so I searched for a white noise app and found myself here. The mixing of sounds is cool and I found myself sleeping like a baby in no time. In fact; when I got home I unplugged the fan and used the app in its stead! Come summer the fan will be back, but this is great! I even have been telling friends how much I love this app. Might have to splurge and buy the thing.",Totally works
5,2018-01-03 14:15:20,"My wife and I have been sleeping with an air cleaner and/or fan for years (for the noise) but have been on vacations where there was no such device. Now, we each pull up this app on both our iPhones and put one on each nightstand for a stereo effect. The result is remarkable. We’re able to sleep deeply and ignore other sounds because we are soothed by the ocean waves, rain, white noise mixes that we have built using the app. We are raving fans. Thanks!",Sleeping like a baby while on vacation
5,2017-08-31 05:04:33,"I've used this app for at least 5 years, able to save all my favorite combinations and volume levels. I have never paid for anything until now.  The entirety of this app is wonderful. I love the fact it has a alarm clock within the app, and the sleep and relaxation methods are amazing for us who both have trouble sleeping--me for staying asleep, my husband for falling asleep.  Amazing what a little white noise will do 👌 thanks, devs, for this little gem of an app.",New updated version THE BEST
5,2023-07-26 11:05:43,I have been using this app for years now and I absolutely love it.  They have so many sound options and the fact that I can choose my own combinations is awesome.

It’s been a lifesaver when we have traveled and forgot our toddler’s sound machine.  I highly recommend it.,Great App

I put on the 4 hz dream “ booster” sound with the “layered brown noise” and “eternal” real low ( only eternal low) and had the beast dreams of my life . If you always wake up before your dream gets good I would download this app. Also great for falling asleep and staying asleep. 10/10,I feel like I hired a new architect
5,2022-11-21 02:30:57,"I e only used it a handful of times so far but I’m very pleasantly surprised with how relaxing the sounds are and that you have the capability to create and save playlists with the free version.

I’m looking forward to trying it a little more and hope the free version remains  accessible.",Very relaxing sounds

3,2022-08-21 15:31:21,"I searched the App Store for a “gentle alarm” with filer “iPad only” and BetterSleep came up. The BetterSleep iPad app *does not* have a gentle alarm; it has no alarm at all. (The iPhone version does have a single alarm, and it is gentle. Why no parity between iPhone and iPad? 🤷🏼‍♀️)  Here’s the thing: I’m searching for a new gentle alarm because the app I used to use for a gentle alarm no longer has one. The app *was* BetterSleep. I’ve loved this app since it was called RelaxMelodies. I bought the lifetime membership, that’s how much I loved it. Past tense.   Multiple alarms for days of the week where you have different schedules? Gone.  Choice of clock alarm or countdown alarm? Gone.  BetterSleep is still great for making ambient soundscapes, but I’m still perplexed —and actually kind of ticked off—that an app that’s designed to put you to sleep at night is not also equipped to wake you up in the morning.",Not a Gentle Alarm!

The journal recently added makes it even better. I only wish it would save your journal more than a week but it’s not a deal breaker since it’s new and just a bonus. The app itself is still one of my favorites.,My favorite nighttime meditation app

There is one complaint I have and it’s not a big one that’ll stop you from downloading the app, I just wish something didn’t have to be to but the subscription tho some things are very free to so I’m not gonna keep composing I wanna thank the people who participated on making this app! Thank you!",The amazing features in this app!
3,2022-03-14 04:08:32,"This app is on my phone and updated, I’ll sometimes let my daughter use it for bed and I have to “Restore Subscription “ all the time. It’s my apple account that is used on both devices so I would assume the purchase should allow for use on both. But when I restore it on my iPad, I have to restore it on my phone, and occasionally it will tell me there was no purchase which is extremely frustrating.   Other than that the app is great when I don’t have to troubleshoot.",Love but sometimes annoying
5,2021-04-27 23:07:23,"Update: after contacting customer support they quickly resolved the issue. I’m thankful to have it back.  This was the answer to my insomnia. But, after I purchased the app, I never purchase apps, it frequently requires me to try to log back in, but my purchase is never restored. I have followed all the instructions to restore it, but none of the options work.  Fix this please, or refund my money.",Loved it at first
1,2020-08-12 07:25:07,"Wait.... I’m super confused how this app has such good reviews? It’s awful. I did the free trial and forgot to cancel my membership so automatically got charge 60$ for the year, whatever my bad not their fault . But the app itself is awful. It always crashes. The sounds never load/download, there are seriously so many glitches that need to be resolved. Not worth 60$. They have the right idea with what they’re doing they just need to do better. If I did not pay for the app I would not be using it.  Oh and p.s. it’s not my phone. I just got a bran new iPhone, it did it in my old iPhone and it still does it on this one. So it has to be a corruption within the app",Too many glitches not worth the price
5,2018-12-02 05:05:48,"I haven’t been able to sleep lately, like I was only getting 1/2 hrs of sleep in a 24hr period! Crazy right then I seen an ad and I downloaded the app and it’s been the best thing ever in my life! Way.. better than counting sheep 🐑 lol I have been sleeping very well ever since. I just turn it on pick a few calming sounds and I am out within 😇🙏🏽😴5mins! Thanks so much! Plus I love all the amazing extras that is included, it is way better than the other apps I have tried!",Best app ever!
3,2020-05-13 04:21:07,"I really enjoy this app aside from one thing. It does a great job putting me to sleep and I enjoy the guided meditations so I purchased the full year subscription. It worked great—at first. Now every time I open the app, it doesn’t recognize that I’ve bought the premium subscription. I go to “restore subscription” and it restores it....for about 30 seconds. I’ve tried to keep restoring, but the problem continues. I really want to continue using the app, but I’m incredibly disappointed that I can’t access the features I’ve paid for.",Great but I have to keep restoring subscription
3,2019-11-09 06:52:15,"Good app, but the new updates make it so that my saved mixes and alarms are hidden behind a few extra tabs, instead of being available right on the home screen like it was in the past. It’s just tedious navigating those tabs. Also, alarms used to be able to simply stop sounds at a given time... this is no longer possible, it can only be done on a countdown now. I had to create an alarm with volume on the sounds turned all the way down to workaround this. It’s fine, the app is just getting more tedious with each update.",New Updates Bad
3,2019-01-30 12:17:34,"I use the free version, because the subscription is just too expensive for what’s offered, in my opinion. I really enjoy the app and the sounds offered for the basic version are really great. However, the past few months the app has stopped working periodically throughout the night, which can cause me to wake up. I could not find any information on their site for the cause of this, and I have the most recent version installed. I only hope that an update will occur that will fix the issue, otherwise I may have to find another app.",Decent App
5,2018-10-22 04:08:10,"I usually sleep 2-4 hours a night and that’s after taking at least 1 hour to fall asleep. I used about 3-5 apps before finding this one and it had changed my life. I turn on the 30 minute timer with piano+rainfall and I’m out within that 30 minutes. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I turn it right back on and I’m out once again. It’s truly my miracle worker. I will never buy or try another app in my life.",Nothing but sleep
5,2018-09-05 06:18:57,"I downloaded the free version to try out for ambient noise for sleeping and relaxing. I really like being able to create different mixes and save them for future use. The timer feature is helpful as well, so it’s not running all night long. There are plenty of sounds to choose from on the free version. My only complaint so far is that I haven’t been able to figure out a way to delete or rename a mix after creating it.",Great for bedtime
5,2018-06-14 14:01:58,"I’ve been having trouble sleeping, so I thought I’d try this app. JACKPOT! I love experimenting with the different sounds and creating my own mixes. I also love the timer, which I set for about an hour. During that time, the app slowly dims until the room is completely dark. Sleeping like a baby now. I also like how you can experiment with many features for free right out the gate. I’ve recommended to many coworkers, who are enjoying it as much as I do.",This app is wonderful!
4,2018-06-28 09:40:01,"I love this app! It’s helped me fall asleep and stay asleep on a family vacation when otherwise I would be up every hour because of family members snoring a few feet away. I just pop my earphones in and turn on one of the mixes I made myself (yes, you can layers different sounds and volumes!) and I’m asleep. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because while they give you a lot of sounds to choose from, there are a lot more interesting ones that I’d like to use that you have to pay for...",Wonderful!
5,2018-05-31 12:03:57,Great app for finding relaxing sounds or background noise. There’s something for everyone in the family. This is not a typical white noise app. The variety and customization options are the best I have experienced. Use a popular combination or create your own.  The built in timer exits the app and sounds continue while in locked screen; both are battery saving features.  Give it a try. My review is based on the free app; upgrade available.,Customizable
5,2018-04-04 07:28:30,I have really bad anxiety & insomnia so you should already sleeping for me is sometimes considered a luxury. This app has done wonders it’s cool and calming melodies has soothes my anxiety (which also can be used for meditating as well to help anxiety) after being gently pulled back into a safe space I’m able to lay down and fall asleep to a mesmerizing sound of ocean waves and wildlife. Would recommend this to people with mental illness & insomnia also would be great for babies. 10/10.,Makes sleeping easier (:
5,2018-01-10 00:40:29,"I use this app everyday when I completing work for my job, when I’m meditating and when I’m winding down for bed. I absolutely love it and it has helped me relax and rest so much better. I love how you can make your own relaxation melody by selecting different sounds because some nights listening to Water drop is relaxing and other nights it makes you have to pee. I highly recommend you get this app and move on top a better night sleep.",My night time ritual
5,2017-11-11 05:19:15,"I was wanting a sleep app because I started waking in the middle of the night again. When I searched for one, I saw that I had already subscribed to Relax Melodies so I reloaded it again. The site has improved greatly with a nice layout and so many new sounds. I love that you can mix and match up to three choices. The lifetime sale offer was too good to pass up so I bought it and I’m enjoying the many features. Sleeping comes back quicker now.",Coming Back
5,2017-10-03 04:20:32,"Ok, so I don't want to speak to soon, but my teething, cranky and irritable 5 month old (who has been a nightmare to get to bed for the past 3 days) just fell asleep with about 5 mins of ""River"" & ""Flute"". I never want this sound to stop!!!!!! My 2 year old and I knocked out with the beautiful sounds as well as I tried to get my smallest one to sleep. I felt like I was on a cloud listening to a Roger flow passed me. It's amazing and I cannot wait to use it NIGHTLY for my little ones and the hubby and I! THANK YOU FOR SUCH AN AMAZING APP!",Baby Asleeps
5,2023-08-18 21:32:06,"I tell everyone about this app. I love that you can layer different sounds, control each of their volumes, have many options between white noise all the way to classical music. I love that you can set a time for it to slowly fade out and / or have the app shut itself off! Upgrading to the premium was so worth it and if you use it a lot, it pays for itself so quickly. 10/10",Can’t live without it!
4,2017-08-27 04:14:37,"I love that you can adjust and mix a good range of sounds! I set sounds on a timer to help me fall asleep, and it works great! I can play relaxing sounds at night without worrying about my phone playing sounds all night. The app can be a little annoying about the premium version if you are a free user like me, but is still fully functional without paying for the expensive full version ($9.99 per month!) I'd be much more likely to pay for the full add free version for a reasonable one-time payment",Nice mix of sounds!
4,2017-06-09 00:47:54,We found our compromise! My husband always turn the TV on when we get in the bed so that he can fall asleep. After many years of this I have gotten use to it but wanted to find something better to fall asleep to because now with the news only being about the guy in the White House I am tired of hearing the name. So thought this would help AND I appreciate this app. We don't need all the paid for ones because the free one are sufficient enough😉 this is a great app.,Better then falling asleep to the TV😏
2,2023-10-01 20:25:27,"How do I start this,, I usually don’t write reviews but I tough I’ll give it a go for this one. This app definitely does not help me sleep, instead it keeps me awake, maybe it’s not for me, long story short I’m a truck driver and I have a hard time getting some quality sleep so I said I’m gonna give this app a try, I saw commercials on tv that it will help you get to sleep in 6 minutes with the green noise, well that doesn’t work on me, I tried different kinds of sound to, no difference,, maybe it’s meant for people who like some kind of noise in the background but not for me",About the app
5,2023-04-10 16:34:41,Where do I begin! Better Sleep makes going to sleep fun! The stories and authors that Better Sleep have are amazing. Not to mention the music and sounds. I had used brown noise most of my life to fall asleep with. This app just blows that away. The customer service is amazing too! I sent a message and within minutes I had a reply! Not many companies do that these days…,They make falling asleep fun and fast!!
3,2023-03-30 04:55:14,"I like this app a lot, and I understand stories and guided meditations they are paying narrators for, but it’s basically unusable without a subscription. So many of the sounds you can create mixes with are available as open source audio or cost next to nothing to record. No reason the entire sound library shouldn’t be free. I think it’s fair to keep the subscription for certain features of the app, but in others it’s unnecessary and honestly just greedy.",It’s good I just wish there wasn’t so much behind the paywall
3,2022-10-11 03:20:20,"The ability to mix songs, sounds, and frequencies is the best I have come across! But the sleep tracker is not only worthless, it’s creepy. It records me breathing, sneezing (which is NoT sneezing, btw) the toilet flushing.   Is this what it’s using to tell me I’m in REM, light sleep or deep sleep? I was laying awake for 3 hours and it “tracked me” in light and deep sleep! I don’t like that if you want to make any changes to the sounds you’re listening to, you must close the whole tracking app. (But I guess it doesn’t matter because it’s 100% erroneous anyway).",The best and worst
5,2022-10-06 04:06:19,This app has helped me sleep so much and I love being able to track my sleep. But I don’t have premium because it’s $40 per year. I think it should be lowered a bit. Also with the “not being able to hear the recordings unless you pay premium” is dumb. There’s no point in letting people record their sleep if they can’t even listen to it.,The app is amazing!!! Just a suggestion though.
5,2022-04-24 15:03:28,"I really love this app it has all. When I want to sleep better and ASAP this app was the answer. If I wanted to calm down and just take things easy and slow this app was there. It may have it’s down because if your not premium most of the exclusives are locked, paying yearly isn’t bad. But this app overall was my first and last because no sleep app can be better then this app. 💕",The Sleep / Dream of a Lifetime 💤
5,2022-02-18 10:10:34,"Ever since I have downloaded this app, I’ve slept SO GREAT. Especially since I can customize my own mix!! And don’t even get me started on the meditation playlists. I swear I was in my bathtub listening to the underwater one and I was FLOATING IN THE OCEAN with all of the creatures and I literally felt like I was right there with them. That was the first and only time I felt I truly meditated and was “hypnotized” it was amazing. The relief I got from that is unexplainable. Truly an amazing app.",Best app ever
5,2021-07-15 07:03:48,"This app is extremely user friendly. Even without purchasing the monthly subscription, I still have access to many different sounds to create my own personal soundtracks that can help me relax the best. Bonus that I can create and save as many soundtracks as I want! Also comes with pre-made tracks as well for anybody who isn’t looking to make their own.",Customizable and Easy to Use
4,2021-11-24 04:58:39,"Love this service but apparently they were bought out and now the app has been redesigned. The previous version was straight forward and relaxing to interact with, this new version is cluttered and not relaxing to interact with.   My suggestion to the devs is to simplify and let us choose the home page and customize it. Stop with all the suggestions. I’m sleeping just fine with how it is. If I need more help I’ll see a sleep doctor.",The previous version was better
5,2021-06-26 05:35:29,"Honestly a great app, it has several options for the free version and doesn’t have ads or anything to disrupt the noise while you try and sleep. Very customizable and I feel like I can properly use the app without having to pay for it but that if you wanted more options they are readily available with a purchase. It’s one of the best ambient noise apps I’ve found so far. :)",Fantastic ambient noise for sleep app
5,2021-04-14 03:54:55,I have only used the trial part of this app. I like that you can make your own relaxation sounds. It has a timer that will stop so you can fall asleep and not worry about it turning off. I like the variety of options for relaxation and meditation. You are able to customize things to individual preferences. My daughter has struggled to fall asleep at night and this has mad a big difference.,Great App
5,2020-02-09 13:47:59,"This app is a favorite of mine! It helps me calm down, and be in the present moment. I had a bad dream once, so this app calmed me down! The only thing I would change I that I don’t have a subscription, so I can’t unlock all the bedtime stories, and the noises, so a suggestion would be to maybe add a few more things for people who don’t want to pay for a subscription. But overall, this app is great, and really helps clear my mind after some days.",Helps me sooo much.
3,2021-03-22 04:32:19,"I used this app for a long time before deciding to pay for a year subscription and I didn't regret it until recently. Suddenly my internet connection is ""insufficient"" to play any of the meditations or stories. Not even the ones I've downloaded (seriously, what's the point of the download option if it won't play when you're not connected to wifi or the app has decided your signal isn't good enough???) I know it recognizes that I'm connected because the premium sounds in my custom mix will play just fine. I'm so disappointed.",I used to love this app...
5,2019-01-10 04:06:54,Love this app. Let’s you combine calming sounds to create the perfect sleep environment (or work environment or yoga environment or whatever you’re using it for). My favorite thing about it is being able to save my “mixes” to my profile. So I have one that’s a mix that sounds just like my childhood home at night in the summer with the window open and another that’s calming bird sounds with flute. I highly recommend it and have told my friends to download it!,Amazing app
5,2018-10-24 06:18:02,"I enjoy the app very much. Nice variety of music and sounds to relax to. From nature sounds to city ambience, it’s all there. You can choose pre made effects, or make your own. The volume modifier for each sound you add is a very nice touch as well, adding another layer of uniqueness to your personal sounds and music combinations. Overall I recommend this app for people who like to relax to different noises, or to sleep, especially those who thrive off of ASMR.",Good app. Very relaxing sounds.
1,2018-12-01 06:59:40,"Every time I update the app and my paid subscription disappears. I only JUST got this app subscription at the beginning of the school year and paid for the yearly subscription. I’ve had this problem several times since purchasing the subscription.   The app is really great when it works! However, I feel like it is a scam trying to trick me into paying for something I already paid for. I read other reviews about this happening frequently with other consumers. While the support team is helpful in restoring purchases, they shouldn’t HAVE to keep restoring purchases for paid customers every couple of weeks. This problem needs to get fixed.",Money grabbing
5,2018-10-11 21:09:50,"I downloaded the app to have a source for repetitive natural sounds, but I was great with not only a surplus of sounds to choose from, but also the ability to combine sounds, add frequencies for purpose, and save sets to come back to later. There is a guided meditation function and a new program called “movements” which helps to guide a person to relieve stress or even cool down from a work out. I would definitely recommend checking it out.",Pleasantly surprised
5,2018-09-28 00:51:24,"I have always used background noise as a way to help my kids sleep. The fact that I have this app on all my iPads, phones and a kindle I can take the sounds with us when we travel. This s helps the kids stay in routine and have a familiar sound when falling asleep. We live in the city so my kids are used to noise and find when we go to my parents in the country it's too quiet. This app helps us every time!",Great sleep sounds for my kids
5,2018-07-20 03:58:22,"I’ve been having trouble sleeping the last few months and was trying to do something different that could help me out. So I downloaded this app, and every time I use it I’m able to fall right to sleep. The rain sound is the best and more authentic sounding than the last app I tried out. I also love that you can turn on numerous sounds. Along with a rain sound I usually play one of the soft melodies they have. I highly recommend!!!",Love this app!

The app has changed in it many updates, which was fine, but it is now asking me to subscribe monthly!! I tried to log in to get my already purchased lifetime subscription, and it’s telling me that my email is not recognized.

I recommend this app to so many people, and to think, I don’t have Premium so think how much more awesome it would be to buy premium!!!!  This app is AMAZING💖💖💖, but one small recommendation, include soundtracks that aren’t made by normal people but by the Relax melodies team but they would make classic sound tracks like forest, or ocean -there is a sound for ocean but I personally like almost all the ocean-ish sounds together, SUPER RELAXING-   This app is practically flawless- everything in this world has some type of mistake-  I love this app good app Recommended!",Super Relaxing!!!! 🌙🌟💜😴

I could not afford to immediately replace my white noise machine again. My husband and I are so glad we found this! I’ll likely never own a white noise machine again, and will upgrade to pro when I can afford it.  Also - great for massage or meditation.",Better than a white noise machine!
4,2018-05-20 23:37:42,I love love love this app. The different options for sounds are just great and the ability to mix and match are wonderful. I think the only thing I dislike is the alarm system. Has never really woken me up but that’s because there’s not a choice for an annoying tone rather than a relaxing one. Just makes me want to stay asleep. I’d also like more options for the sleep beats. I know you have to pay for them all but more samples so we can all get a taste of how they work. Overall a great app!,Great but also Pros and Cons

5,2019-09-27 05:00:57,"I love this app!!!! I have chronic insomnia. Relax Melodies is one of the few things that help me get some rest. I just wish that it wasn’t a monthly subscription. I would much rather have one time fee that isn’t too expensive. I’m on a fixed income on disability. Can’t afford to pay much. Again, what you offer for free is great. I’ve had the paid version in the past. I just can’t afford to continue it now. Thank for listening to me rant, lol.",Time to get some sleep...
5,2019-05-31 05:17:35,"My nursing advisor actually referred me to get this when I was having difficulty sitting myself down and staying focused on what I was studying. Since I got it, I have fallen in love with it. I use it when I study, meditate, pray, and even as a way to relax myself to go to sleep. I almost can’t go to sleep without it now! The ease and repetition of it makes it very nice background music to have when you are doing something that you want to focus on but don’t want silence.",I Love It!!!
5,2018-11-19 07:27:39,"This app is easy to use, has lots of various sounds to choose from and layers them for endless combinations. It’s kinda fun to try new sound combinations with individually adjusted volume settings for each effect - and great to help you really relax. Whether used to get a good night's rest, or to help ease a feeling of anxiety or depression–this app works pretty great!  (I use the free sounds only, and really enjoy using this app. Definitely worth a download I think.)",Soothing Sounds-Great Relaxer
5,2018-11-16 02:29:50,"I use this for sleep sounds almost every night, and I love that there is a timer so that I don’t have to worry about it running too long overnight and overheating my phone. I also use it for a quick custom “soundscape” for my clients when I give them facials and am able to tweak the balance or sounds being used if they don’t like something. Just a quick personalized sound experience! You can create all kinds of scenarios!",Great!
5,2018-10-10 06:21:04,"I found this application like 5 years ago after college because I used the water machine in college. I now cannot sleep without this application. I put it on every single night no matter where I am, it is amazing. You can play it all night long and it won't affect your alarm or anything. The best sound app!! I also know a ton of mothers that use this with their babies and they love it. Also uses VERY little battery.",Can't sleep without it
5,2018-09-29 08:08:05,"This is such a great app, and I love it so much. I fall asleep to it most nights. I have trouble falling asleep, and this app really helps me. I love that there are so many different soothing combinations, and you can put all your favorite sounds together for the ultimate soothing experience. Although I really wish all the sounds were free because I don’t have the money to be spending on this type of thing. It honesty really makes me sad. Great app though. I recommend it",Love this app!
5,2018-06-06 10:14:33,"In my life.. I have struggled a lot. Recently I've had much more trouble than expected. It's hard to keep my anxiety at a low, or to.. fall asleep. This app has actually helped me very much. I adore it in all ways possible. Thank you for producing it. I'm hoping to see more soon!❤  Update: I’ve used this app for a few years now. I always had issues trying to find an app that really suited my needs and this app has met my needs WITH BONUSES. Fantastic app. Worth it.🙌🏻",Perfect!..
4,2018-08-28 01:42:00,"I love this app and it helps me go asleep right away and everything they give me is good but it’s what they don’t give me is why they only got 4 stars. There are some special sounds for de-stressing, dreams, no dreams, yada yada yada but one night my dog was dying so I wanted some destressing music but nooo you have to be “pro” aka spend money. Ik tons of apps do this and it’s how they make money but idk I just wanted to soothe myself a little bit while my dog was dying but it’s ok. On a happier note, this apps helps me fall asleep right away and would totes recommend 👍🏻",Pretty good
5,2018-05-25 04:13:51,As a over the road truck driver you don’t typically get a good nights rest with all the other loud trucks coming in & out the parking area or a refrigerated trailer parked next to you constantly turning on and off but once I turn the relax melodies on I’m off to the beach or relaxing in a cave with a fire pit crackling listen to the rain fall or storm winds or the waves crashing along the coast line. You be anywhere you want to be! I’m never in the bunk of my truck!,Best sleep I’ve had in months!
5,2018-05-23 17:40:42,I work night shift and so coming home in the morning with the sun blaring and the day to day sounds had been keeping me up and I haven’t been sleeping well. In turn makes for a long next shift at work and being slightly irritable at times.  Relax Melodies as me calming down sooner when I get home and sleeping more peacefully cause it drowns out the daily day time noise around the house and outside.  Love the fax that I can make up my own melodies or white noise the most!  ~C~,Love to Sleep
5,2018-05-22 04:22:20,"I love all of the sounds. I really love how I can make my own mixes and save them so I can change them every night. I also really love the meditations, but sometimes I wish that I didn’t have to be a “pro” to do most of the things.i wish that we could have some more of the things be free, like more of the meditations, and more noises to help me fall asleep and relax me. But overall I love this app and use it every Night, it really helps me to fall asleep! I give it 5 STARS!❤️❤️",Love it!
5,2018-05-20 13:26:45,"I lay in bed for hours and I get about 3 hours of sleep every night. I am not focused in school and I often drift off. My teachers worry about me and tell me to get more sleep. My mom bought this app for me and I am out every night after 10 minutes of listening to one of my mixes. Not only are they helpful and great sounding, they are fun to make! Plus, you can have TWELVE, thats right twelve different sounds per mix! I am planning on purchasing pro.",I struggle with Insomnia.
5,2018-05-07 07:28:43,"I'm not a techie and could easily figure out how to use this app.  I was most interested in using app for white noise to more easily fall asleep; the timer feature just made it even better. Sounds included with app were all I needed but you can buy more if interested. It does use some battery, but I have my phone plugged in at night so this is not a problem for me.  I recommend you give it a try!","Easy to use, timer is great feature"
5,2018-04-30 01:50:21,I have ALWAYS had trouble falling asleep let alone into a deep sleep. I am a very restless sleeper. The noises help to go to sleep fast and wake up replenished. I also like how you can put together sounds. Most apps you can just play one annoying rain sound that gives you a headache. But with this you are able to make your own collage of sounds to please your own liking. I would definitely recommend this app for all ages. 2 giant thumbs up!,2 thumbs up!
5,2018-03-15 05:03:23,"This is a good sound app if you like to use a sound machine at night.  I like the ability to pick two or three different sounds to play together and give me a little more to Focus on as I fall to sleep.  It also helps cover other noises well, when you can pick the best sounds to cover them.  I leave it on all night and it does not get noting or tinny.  So I like the app and would highly recommended it.",Love the ability to customize!
5,2018-02-11 06:47:48,"I’m a habitual sleep procrastinator. I stay up past becoming tired and tend to get a second wind as soon as I’m in bed. The app has plenty of free sound effects that you can combine to create a sound soothing to you, though I prefer not to mix. Combined with small thought tricks, the sound makes a good distraction from thoughts that can keep you awake. Would recommend for insomniacs who google ways to fall asleep instead of going to bed.",Cut my fall asleep time in half
5,2018-01-30 05:11:02,"I got this app because at night, it’s difficult to meditate for me. I meditate twice a day. In the mornings I sit outside and listen to the ocean, the breeze, the trees, birds, feel the sunshine. It’s difficult at night because I’m indoors and none of that Happy noise really exists outside. Plus it’s been really cold. So I basically combine all the noises I like to listen to within the app, and I’m able to add wind chimes which I really love and it makes it a more enjoyable meditation atmosphere within my apartment.",Loving it!
5,2017-06-28 22:25:21,"I live this app! It is cool too be able to put together your own melody by selecting the available sounds. You can even adjust the volume on each sound so that certain sounds are in the background while others are out front. It has helped me relax when having a hard time falling asleep, and has also provided a relaxing atmosphere even during a hectic day at work. I highly recommend this app.",Lives up to its name
5,2017-06-09 09:40:01,"I have nothing to complain about with this app, since ive downloaded all I've been looking forward to is sleep. I love the fact it allows you to adjust the volume of each particular sound you choose to where the all play in perfect harmony. I have Nothing to complain about. Thank you to the creators of this wonderful app going to bed now. Oh! Before I forget it does drain your battery so keep your phone plugged in at night.",Nothing!
5,2023-08-03 09:46:26,"I love this app and have used it almost everyday for a year or so now And it’s the perfect app for sleeping to There’s fully customizable music/sound options to make your own perfect playlist, And the timer is really useful for people who’s phones get hot when something is on for hella long! I couldn’t thank the developers enough for this app because it has been the only thing that helps me sleep! Plus there’s no ads for the free version, buttttt if I could afford the subscription I absolutely would buy it! I really enjoyed the guided meditation that they offer through the subscription (I got a 3 day trial)   Pretty much VERY RECOMMENDED even if you can’t buy the subscription it’s so worth downloading and just trying it",Most perfect sleep app!!!!
5,2023-07-08 12:53:43,I never knew what my sleep looked like or what my type of sleep pattern was until this app. Craziest thing is that when I wake up and see my number it really correlates to how I feel. If it’s 55 or below I’m still tired and feel groggy. But if it’s a 65-70 or better I feel refreshed and ready to go. This sleep app has really opened my eyes to how my sleep has effected my mood and everything else in my life.,Helps So Much
5,2023-04-11 11:36:19,"I absolutely love it! But there’s one little issue; 65% of what is on the app costs money, and, I know they need some source of income considering they put so much time into the app. And $3.99 isn’t a bad price I just wish more of it was free, others than that I recommend this app to, well really anyone, it’s perfect for falling asleep or stories for your kids.  I’d give it 4.5 but I’m rounding it up to 5.0.   From,     MagnoliaFlowerss",It’s good but…
5,2023-03-18 16:59:29,"Hi! I am the type of person who takes almost 2 hours to actually fall fully asleep. My parents had shown this app to me a night where I had to sleep early. I love how this app so many free sounds! My absolute favorite is any of the rain/storm, fire, and especially the butterfly sound. The butterfly sound brings old memories back so it’s nice to hear that to fall asleep. Thank you for this wonderful app :)",It works!
5,2023-02-14 04:56:04,"I want to express my appreciation for the BetterSleep App team!  They genuinely care about their product and how it helps people!    They’ve made constant improvements and at the same time listen to the feedback of their users.  They also have a help and support message center within the app that reps respond to in a timely, friendly, and helpful way!    Recently with one of the updates a feature that was vital to me stopped working.  I reached out and they took my feedback and made it work again!  The best customer service I could ask for!

5,2023-01-08 05:39:15,"I haven’t gone to bed before midnight more than a handful of times in the last year. I toss and turn all night, usually resulting in around 4-6 hours of terrible quality sleep. I’ve used BetterSleep for the last 3 nights and feel like a completely different person! My husband even told me I’m falling asleep quicker than he’s seen in a while. Thank you BetterSleep 😊",Best sleep I’ve had in over a year!
4,2023-01-27 11:24:05,"I love this app, and it’s much better waking up to its peaceful alarms in the morning. I manage to get to sleep faster with all its meditation sounds. However, for the past three days, the alarm feature has not worked in the morning. I will set my alarm for the morning, and it will not go off, and I’ll find the app closed when I open my phone.  If this one issue could be fixed, this app would definitely be 5 stars.",Really great but one issue
5,2022-11-25 07:14:57,"I was frustrated when I forgot to cancel my free trial (signed up while in a desperate anxiety-induced tinnitus spiral) and am now SO GLAD I have a whole year of this app! The ONLY app I pay for. I’ve never found reliably wonderful guided mediations like these, soo soothing and real. Being able to mix my own sounds is an absolute godsend for my ears, brain, and body. Love that I can use it in airplane mode!!! Absolutely worth a paid subscription.","😍 Life-saver, 11/10"
4,2022-12-03 02:45:31,"The customization and personalization of the app speaks volumes of your knowledge of self help. There’s something for everyone here. It might be too early to say whether it’s the app or not, but the past nights I’ve used the sounds bar, have been the best nights sleep I’ve had in a great long while.  Thank you for your care and devotion to helping those who are struggling greatly to survive the day to day. Keep up the great work!!",Better Sleep is amazing and I only just started!
5,2022-11-17 14:18:39,"It’s too soon to tell results, but so far I am really the different features, especially the sounds I can pick for my different moods. my drives to and from work have been more calming with some guided meditation.   I’m looking forward to learning more about my sleep patterns, it’s impressive how in depth this app goes; ie: the feature where it records my sleep patterns through the night.","new to this, but so far so good"
5,2022-10-28 03:52:36,I have only been using for a few days but I can already feel the difference. The sleep journal really helped to pinpoint what was interrupting my sleep. I also really like having the frequencies added to my sleep sounds. I am going to purchase once the trial is over and I normally don’t because of the free options but I think it is worth it.,Great lots of options for better sleep
5,2022-09-02 04:23:55,"This app seems to be quite effective. The first night I used it I set up a few soothing tones , plated it at a moderate level via Bluetooth, and slept much more peacefully and for 2 extra hours! I usually sleep 4-5 hours a night and I’m a light sleeper who wakes up and stays up. The sounds on this app were helping me drift back to a sleep state. One of the best nights of sleep I had in a long time!",First Night +2 More Hours Of Sleep!!!
1,2022-10-16 06:41:41,"I used to be such a fan of this app! I made playlists of what my old neighbors nature sounded like, or the chicago city. It’s to buggy now though. I’ll try to open it, and it will always kick me out and put me back to Home Screen. I have tried multiple ways of preventing this, to prevail nothing. Shutting off my phone? Nope. Closing all the other apps! There is none to close. I’ve tried deleting it, and of course that didn’t work. It’s super upsetting because I have insomnia, and this app but me to sleep like it was nothing. I really hope the creators of this app will respond. I need this app, and I don’t want to give you guys one star! Thank you.",Buggy
5,2022-07-16 01:12:54,"I’ve never especially been one to pay for subscriptions, but after wearing out the free examples on the app (particularly the stories), I knew I had to go ahead with this one. It’s straight up worth every penny! I’ve recently begun to get more into the meditations/hypnosis options. I usually like tucking my phone right under my pillow when listening. I definitely would recommend subscribing! ✨",Dreams and more
5,2021-11-20 11:33:28,"Everything about this app is perfect…from the sleeping sounds to the sleep tracking feature, it’s full of useful content and great tips..the majority of the app is free(as it should be) which is why it stands out from the rest (like the Calm app)…I love how you can choose up to 15 different backgrounds as well as music. It’s perfect for everyone in my family. Thanks for this❤️💤",Finally something that works
4,2022-01-20 20:35:15,"I rated this app a 4 only because there are a LOT of things that you can’t access because of premium. Although the things that don’t require premium are just as effective, I would still like to access just a bit more. Anyway, if you can decide if you want to download this app, definitely do so, the stories that are narrated made me fall asleep in less than 5-8 minutes. I absolutely love this app and I 100% recommend it :))",pretty good!!
4,2022-01-18 04:09:28,"I've used the free version of this app for over a year to help get a decent nights sleep. Just the quiet, gentle sounds help me relax. And being able to see my sleep has been a big help in adjusting for a new job.  However since the most recent update I've had a problem with losing my sound mixes every other night. Not sure if this is just me or a glitch, but it's getting annoying.",Use every night but recent update frustrating
5,2021-10-08 05:32:59,I love the app and it is very helpful when it comes to me falling asleep I have insomnia and the nighttime sos is super helpful for certain situations! One thing I would recommend though is making more things available for people who don’t pay because before I started my subscription there was a very limited amount of things that I could do. The app overall is amazing though!,Best app for sleeping!
5,2021-06-01 12:14:05,"One thing I miss though, unless it is there and I have not been able to find it, is to be able to change the speed of the narration. I find some narrators are too fast for my liking to try to fall asleep, so being able to slow them down like in audiobook apps would be helpful instead of simply avoiding that narrator.",Lots of options for customization
5,2021-04-19 09:34:11,"I get needing to make money but the free version used to be so much better. You used to be able to make your own sound oasis, but now you can only pick certain mixes that are preset. You never got them all but I can’t find where you even could make your own mix anymore even if you paid for it. I used to love this app but am sadly disappointed now.",Changes to the free version
5,2020-07-10 22:20:47,I had a bad day turned on a relaxing sound on here and it 100% helped. I use it to sleep and it helps so much I fall asleep so much faster. When you use it you can set a timer on the sound so when you sleep with it it automatically turns off. I set mine for an hour every night and wake up and it is turned off. You can pick from a variety of sounds and mix and match I recommend this app very much.,Very helpful
3,2021-02-07 18:53:45,I love this app and everything in it but I feel it would be better if more stuff was free. I understand you need to make money so maybe you could make more of them free or make the subscription less. There’s only 4 free stories out of like 50 or so. I love all the free stuff but it would be better if maybe like 1/3 or 2/5 of it were free. If you truly want to help people than you shouldn’t make people pay for most of it. Once again this app is amazing and I totally recommend it for people who are willing to pay $60 for a subscription.,Amazing app but...
4,2020-10-05 15:37:35,"Thanks for the free sounds. I love using this app to cover early morning highway noise.   White noise has a distinct and constant ooowap background sound on a one two rhythm. It’s not annoying if you pretend it’s a bullfrog.  I would’ve subscribed years ago, but I refuse to pay so much for sounds I can’t preview. (I’ve requested this option from developers twice.) The free trial is nice for people to really try out the sounds, but I’m not going through the process of entering my cc just to preview.","Great, but White Noise has a big problem."
5,2020-05-03 17:00:13,"Just started using the app and have already seen an improvement in my sleep. I also use it with my noise-cancelling headphones while working. It helps to block out distracting ambient noises, allowing me to better focus.   Currently only use one mix, but hope to be able to incorporate other options in the future.

I (re)downloaded this app and find it so useful, not just when I’m falling asleep, but to assist with meditation as well (in place of ambient music). I like that I can layer sounds and control the volume of individual sounds. Hoping to upgrade at some point but currently enjoying the free version.",Exactly what I needed but didn’t know I wanted
2,2019-06-01 15:44:04,"I used to be a huge fan of this app.  You could make your own mixes from a huge variety of unorthodox (yet very comforting) sounds.  You could include binaural beats, too.  Over time, the free content dwindled from everything except meditation, then half the sounds for mixing, then the binaural beats, and then everything except about a dozen sounds.  With better options available just on a web browser (let alone other apps,) it’s not really worth it.  I included another star since it’d be a wonderful app as long as you’re willing to pay for it.",Was great until 85% of the content required a subscription.

5,2018-12-01 17:51:17,"It’s a REALLY great app that helps me sleep and if I don’t have my phone at night to listen to my own personal mix, then I toss and turn. Before I got this app I would always have trouble sleeping and relaxing at night. This app saved me and helps me every night! I ALWAYS recommend this app to anyone that asks about it and it’s just overall the best app of its kind. I’ve downloaded many apps to help me sleep, and this was the only one that actually worked.",AMAZING!!!!!!!
5,2018-11-11 09:32:48,"Really like the free options. Only thing that would make this better is if it had a timer to turn off. Maybe it does and I just don’t see it. Other than that I’m really enjoying it, and it saved my live (not literally) on a recent trip when I couldn’t sleep due to a fog horn and this app really helped get me to sleep. UPDATING REVIEW — found the timer, or I should say figured out how to use it! Thank you Relaxing Melodies, you’ve changed my life !!",Great app!
5,2018-10-27 17:08:25,"I purchased the lifetime option and it’s has totally changed my sleep. Only thing I wish it had was a option for polyphasic sleep patterns. It only allows bed times for mono-phasic sleep cycles.  Mono meaning one, 7-8 hours cycles vs poly meaning multiple cycles. If the app ever allowed multiple bed times I see more business CEOs using this application.  Other then that this app is perfect!  Sounds are stackable/layered so you listen to exactly what you need to sleep!!!  LOVE THIS APP!!!!!",Perfect. Must get lifetime
5,2018-08-24 02:30:23,"I actually have a really hard time sleeping in silence and this app works wonders! I love how you can actually overlap sounds and adjust the volumes to your liking, then you can save them and listen to your creations anytime. Also, there are so many sounds to choose from and you can even choose sounds that other people have put together. This is a real pregnant woman who can’t sleep making a review about an app that truly works. Thank youuuuu!",So awesome!!!!
5,2018-05-28 00:13:29,"Best white- noise app I’ve ever experienced. A lot of options- and they aren’t hokey, synthetic sounds. They give you the option to layer sounds (and they pair very nicely- eg. thunderstorm and slow waves). You can also control volume etc for each sound, and set timers. Oh and the upgrade is also totally worth it. Umm and they gift you two free sounds for giving a review 💁🏻. Go with this app!! Haven’t had any issues, zero bugs if you obviously update consistently.",Do it!!
4,2018-07-30 22:17:29,"Very nice to have an app that allows you to mix your own soundscape for meditation, relaxing, or even upbeat focus music, given the right selections.  I’ve found that it helps to try out unusual combinations of the sounds just to see what works best.  And if you need a track without high notes or particular sounds due to auditory sensitivities, simply put the sounds you do want together and leave out those that are often in music you would otherwise like to listen too!",Love Mixing Your Own Meditation Soundscape
5,2018-04-16 12:35:55,"I tried a couple sleep aid apps before this one, and I’ve gotta say, this one was definitely the best. Lots of options and more customizable than the others, I went from staying up an average of an hour to an hour and a half before falling asleep, to being asleep within 15 minutes or so. I’d recommend at least giving it a shot, couldn’t hurt to try, and the meditation practices are really relaxing as well.",Definitely the best
4,2018-05-09 18:39:58,"I love that this app has such a variety and lets you choose how loud each “sound” is in a mix. I put on the timer and use it to help me fall asleep (I usually do a combo of heavy rain, night, and campfire), I use it during my newborn photo shoots to keep the baby asleep and relaxed (sometimes I use white noise, heavy rain, the lullaby, or oscillating fan... whatever each baby responds to. I do wish I had free access to the heartbeat for this), and I use it for concentration while doing my school work (a combo of storm and 20hz binaural beats).",Love this app!
5,2018-03-04 05:22:16,"My 11yo daughter was the one to turn me on to this, as she likes ""white noise"" when sleeping. But I was floored by the variety of sounds and, most impressively, the ability to layer the sounds (as many or as few as you like), not to mention the ability to separately control the volume of each one! It's like having a mixing board to customize the experience. My favorite is the cat purring (usually with frogs or cicadas plus ocean, wind, or flute) - it's surprisingly soothing!",Essential app

5,2022-11-17 18:12:36,Sound gives that extra boost in creativity and focus. Just being in the zone of your agenda. For me it has been literal magic to my ears trickling down into my soul and filling my cup with goodness! And I have the power to create each sound unique to me. Where it fits my mood just right in each moment! I can’t wait to see what improvements and new tunes they add to the sound board! One thousand stars!,My sanctuary
4,2023-02-26 05:29:01,"I think the sounds are really nice but I do wish it let you sample the paid ones. It let me record my sleep but wouldn’t tell me any of the sounds (sleep talking, snoring, etc) it got until I paid for a subscription. It also showed me my rem cycle which I feel like was a lie because how would it know that just by recording sound. Other than that  though, it’s not bad and if u just want some relaxing sounds then for sure get it.",It’s pretty good
2,2023-01-27 12:27:04,"Puts me right to sleep and helps me to maintain a healthy bedtime routine! UPDATE: it’s been less than a week of paying the subscription fee and the app started to crash and has continued for 3 days. There is NOT A WAY to store your sleep data so be prepared for your data to disappear as it did for me. The sounds are terrific but the overall sleep tracking system needs work. I cancelled my subscription and will be either choosing a new sleep tracking app or will be going back to Sleep Cycle, where my data is saved and stored for accuracy.",Bugs and Crashing Constantly
5,2022-10-20 02:37:56,"I have suffered with insomnia for several years. I’ve tried over the counter medication and I wake up groggy, I’ve tried melatonin but I still wake up throughout the night, and I’ve tried prescription medication and had terrible results. This app is the only thing I’ve found that can help me fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up feeling fresh! Thank you so much!!!",Better than sleep meds!
5,2022-10-19 02:16:33,Absolutely loved this App the past 3 yrs but unfortunately for the last 2 days I haven’t been able to open the app. It keeps crashing. And I have plenty of data on the phone so it’s not due to lack of space on my phone. Not sure what’s going on. Will fix stars and write an updated review when this is fixed. - app is back up and running. Thank you BetterSleep!!!,Update! Not Working?
5,2022-09-08 00:27:36,I’ve had this app for years (back when it had a different name) and I always liked that you can curate your own listening experience. You can layer the sounds and music to fit your mood or intention. After not using the app for a long time I rediscovered it and love it all over again. Love the little night frogs and babbling water with gentle chimes! Lovely! Highly recommend.,Lovely Relaxing Sounds
3,2022-10-04 04:21:48,"This review is in hope it reaches the developers. I know many improvements have been made lately. I love this app especially the customization of mixes and the sleep fiction. I will continue to use it but I would like to report a bug I found. When I use one of my mixes with a timer and then start sleep tracking for the night, the app shortly after stops working and I have to leave the app and come back. Sometimes it fixes the issues but most of the time it doesn’t.",New issues
4,2022-02-18 08:33:09,I’ll start out by saying this is the best sleep app I’ve ever used! The fact that you can customize your own mix of sounds to fit what soothes you best?! Chef’s kiss. The only problem I have is every. single. morning the app loves to connect to the Bluetooth in my car and I’ve searched the internet (and my phone settings) for weeks to figure out how to stop it with no luck. It’s a minor inconvenience for sure and one I’ll live with cause the app is so great.,Almost 5 Stars
5,2021-09-19 06:56:41,I've been using this app to help my son sleep for over a year. It's awesome that I always have it on hand when we are traveling and don't have to remember yet another item and the variety of sounds and fact that they can be stacked on each other is great. Beats a sound machine any day in my opinion! I just run it on a phone I don't use anymore all night while we're home.,Great sound app
4,2022-02-16 02:38:23,"Just started using this app so I’m still exploring it.  Found the 7-minute technique used by the military and loved it!   But I haven’t found a way to mark it as a favorite so I don’t have to search for it every night.  Of course, I was looking under the sleep tab; but it is under meditation, duh.   I am 72 years old with an ADHD brain.  Sleep is an elusive animal for me, but I’m impressed with what little I’ve found on this app.   Will probably rate this a five-star as I learn more !",Sleep meditation
5,2021-06-06 18:08:42,"A fantastic app!   I have tried every app of this type I could find, and this was definitely the best. I highly recommend it to light sleepers and/or insomniacs.   New: I updated to the new version and I am very pleased! The new layout for meditations is a great improvement and the ability to adjust the sound levels from the selection pane is fantastic! An excellent App; I still listen every night.",Excellent
5,2020-07-28 05:14:33,I personally think this app is pretty fantastic and offers a fairly wide variety of sounds considering it's the free/lite version. I have trouble falling asleep and I don't have an actual noise maker so this app is very useful to me. The only issue I have really ever had with this app is that it occasionally lags a bit while trying to play some of the audio or switch through the pages. Other than that it's practically perfect!,One of my faves
5,2020-06-09 17:32:42,"I’m not the best at writing reviews, so it’ll keep it short. This app has some beautiful songs available! Even though some a pretty good portion of them aren’t available without purchasing, I was able to create beautiful mixes!! I love that you can transport your self anywhere with the noises, for example one of my mixes is called, “After Hours At the Wizard Academy”, because it reminds me of playing wizard 101 as a kid. 😂 Anyways, highly recommend!!",So claming!!!
5,2020-05-30 05:50:59,"I haven’t gone a single night for the past 8 years without this app. I’ve tried multiple combinations of sounds until I found my favorite. If I’m in a calm mood, I’ll put some city noises. If I’m in need of calm, I’ll put some soothing songs and animal noises, all along with a few other background noises that bring each other out nicely. I sleep like a baby!!! 🤱🏻",Been using this app for 8 years. The best.
5,2019-07-30 06:02:29,"I went searching for other solutions after having trouble sleeping or waking up restless in the middle of the night. I decided to use this app and since starting haven’t woken up in the middle of the night. I mainly just mixed two sounds that I found more relaxing and allow myself to drift to sleep. I’ve never stood awake for the timer for the sounds to finish either! If you’re looking for a solution, this is a great option!",Great App to help Insomnia!
5,2018-11-17 08:18:40,"I got this app for my son who was having trouble sleeping and it worked immediately! Then I started using it and it has been great. The sound options are very good and the app lets you layer the various sounds and create favorite combinations. I am a big fan. I have the free version right now but I am intrigued by many more sounds available with the full version so I will probably buy it in the future. Great job, developers!",Very relaxing and effective
5,2018-10-31 07:49:03,"This is actually the ONLY thing that has ever 100% helped me to sleep. I have had a lifetime of sleep issues, but this app helps me to relax every single time. There are so many different sounds and sleep meditation programs to help with a variety of different sleep problems you may have. I recommend it to anyone who has had problems shutting off their brain at night.   Thank you SO much for helping me, Relax Melodies! You’ve no idea! 💜 💤",Zzzzzzzz
5,2018-10-10 03:02:54,"I downloaded many different mindfulness/meditation apps, reviewed and used their free sample medications to decide if I wanted to purchase a subscription on a monthly basis and then I found relax meditation and relax melodies. I only had to purchase this app once not pay on a monthly basis.  Love the voice of the practitioner, meditations are easy to follow and they have a “focus” for all of my needs. This app is more than five stars, thank you very much for an affordable, dependable and beautiful app!",LOVE this meditation app
5,2018-10-03 02:53:45,I've had to sleep with a fan on since I was young. Well my hubby hates it once it starts getting cold because it freezes him out so I told him I'll try a white noise app and see if it will do any good. I've been using this nightly for about a month now and not only does it make me fall asleep quicker it helps him sleep more soundly at night. It's crazy how sounds affect your sleep. I love how you can mix the sounds. I highly recommend this app,Helps so much!!
5,2018-08-20 05:20:05,"I suffer from anxiety, depression, panic and anxiety attacks, as well as ptsd. It’s hard to live my life most days. Trying sleep when my brain is reliving my day over and changing it, making it worse, not just in the quite before sleep but, in my twisted dreams too, it had become unbearable. With therapy, yoga, meditation, and this beautiful app I can live my life. This app is a major link in my sanity chain. I can’t sleep without it. Thank you so much!",Can’t sleep without you
4,2018-09-14 07:59:42,"Have only used this app for a few days, but the free version of the app has a lot of sound choices to choose from.  Mixing several sounds together is easy to do, and I like the mixes I have tried putting together.  I like the ability to alter the relative volumes of the different sounds one chooses to mix together.  Other features in the free version of the app include a timer (which I use) and an alarm (which I have not tried to use as yet).  Bottom line - a very useful app, so far.","So far, so good"
5,2018-07-31 03:10:32,"My 18mo loves this app and can’t sleep without it.  (Our favorite tune is lounge, ocean and rain.) I implemented listening to Relax Melodies into his night time routine at 9mo and it’s been the best thing I could have ever done. He falls asleep so fast now, I don’t need to spend two hours rocking him to sleep or breastfeeding forever - he hears the tune and is out. I’m beyond thrilled that I found something that works so well for us. In my opinion it is most definitely worth the download!",Awesome app
5,2018-07-15 15:36:27,"This app is great for helping me get my mind clear to go to sleep or to just calm some anxiety. The free sounds and guided meditations are great, and there are certain opportunities to add more without paying. This is an app I have considered paying for though just because of the quality of what they already offer. I also like that you can set a timer for it to exit the app so that you don’t drain your battery overnight!",Helps to sleep and just calm down
5,2018-07-09 07:14:49,So many options for sounds! I love the mixes and have so much fun creating my own mixes. Really like that you can adjust the level of each sound in the mixes. Also love that I can set it to shut off automatically. Just had a baby and use this app to relax her when nothing else is working! Better than the sound machine we bought. It was definitely worth paying for the upgrade.,Lots of options!
5,2018-06-27 03:19:04,"Let’s face it, insomnia gets the best of us. This app has been a lifesaver when I need to sleep but find relaxing enough to do so a bit of a challenge. With so many sounds to choose from - simple white noise to urban rain - you will find yourself drifting off to sleep or just simply going to your “chilled out place” in no time. I love that there is a timer and an alarm clock feature as well. Everything I need in one app. Bravo, Relax Melodies!",All the goodnight feels
5,2018-01-20 15:42:27,"I have recently had trouble sleeping due to my severe anxiety and a friend recommended listening to some soothing sounds to help me sleep and so I looked for an app that could help me sleep and found this gem and now I’m really loving it because it helps me relax and go to sleep a lot faster! I definitely recommend this app to anyone who has trouble sleeping! I also love the customization of sounds, so I can put together my favorite sounds into one 😊 love love love the app!",Great app!
4,2018-05-21 04:46:20,"Been using this app for 3 years.  Love what they’ve developed over that time, but I wish they hadn’t started charging for stuff they had given away as free in the beginning.  They could have just started charging for the new stuff they added and rewarded their long time fans with a grandfather plan.  Kinda disappointed. I would have paid for new cool stuff - just feel kind of betrayed having the things I enjoyed for free for years suddenly get taken away and now have to pay for. Rude.","3 years of love, but...."
4,2017-11-04 05:53:45,"I use this app as a white noise machine for my baby daughter.  I think the design is really cool. You can choose different sounds and combine them and overlap them so that you can form your own soundtrack. I like how many different options there are. Some of the content is locked so you have to pay for it, but I just don't buy that. Also I don't like the part that has guided meditation. I'm not into that, so I wish I could delete it but I haven't figured out a way to do that. Overall neat app.",Neat concept & design
5,2017-09-22 18:36:22,"As an instructor, this is the perfect app to give me a bit of background noise while I plow through my students' papers. It would work well for students, too, when they have to read or write (something which can be difficult to do with music with lyrics). I wish the melodies were longer as after a while I find I need to change things up. (Maybe that's part of the pro package?)",Perfect for teachers (and students)
5,2017-08-07 17:08:37,"Who doesn't get a little stressed out from time to time? We all do! And meditation is proving to be the latest trend to manage our busy lives that actually increases wellness. Everyone from the renowned Mayo Clinic to Oprah Winfrey recommend the practice to lower stress and decrease stress related symptoms. But what is meditation? If you're new, it can be as simple as spending some time listening to the melodies on this app. Just click (my favorite is the ocean) and find your stress melting away.",A Must Have
5,2017-06-13 04:27:53,"This isn't the first (or even second) white noise app I have tried, but it might possibly be the last one. There's a whole range of sounds and the option to mix and match. I've never seen this many choices in an app. There are city noises and nature sounds, music and tonal frequencies. It is awesome. I love reading with the app. It definitely helps me relax and concentrate to make the most of my arm-chair adventures! Definitely will recommend to others.",Great versatility
5,2017-06-12 01:40:49,I have used this app for as long as I've had an iPhone. I love that you can have multiple sounds at once and adjust the volume for each sound. So I can have thunderstorm turned low and rain on roof turned up with white noise in the middle. Now I don't need to run a fan in winter and I can take my white noise with me on the road for vacation or camping.... or even just to sleep in my daughter's room after she had a nightmare.,Great at home and for traveling
5,2022-10-19 23:37:13,If there was a way to continue from one lesson to the next automatically it would be nice. Perhaps I’m not familiar with it enough either.  I learned a bit more about the app and how to use it and update my review to 5/5 stars. Would still like an auto-continue feature but allall this is a great app.,The voice is nice and soothing but the music could use a bit of work and more variety.
4,2022-11-25 18:55:37,"For what I downloaded it for, this app is awesome! I usually sleep with a fan, but for traveling or staying a night with a friend I always use this app. My only complaint is that only a fraction of the sounds, stories, and meditations are available for free. In order to use the other sounds and the additional stories and meditations you have to buy a subscription. All in all, it’s a great app that fulfills my needs, and that’s all I really need.",Free white noise and water sounds

It was AWESOME!!!! 👏 You get to chose Sounds and make your own sounds by combining other sound together to make your PERFECT 👍🏼 Sound Machine/Sound Maker!!!! There is only one downside…………….. You do have to pay for extra Sounds sadly. 😢 But, overall this app is amazing!!!!","Amazing, but 1 thing"

So I use every aspect of this thing. Accept maybe the counting sheep button lol!  But I’m very impressed with this app in every way. From the variety of sounds, to the stories and meditations, to the brainwave sounds for better dreams! And it’s cheaper than a lot of those other app’s that have lower ratings. Plus they add new stuff all the time.   If I may make one suggestion, could you please add the sound of ravens with all the other animal sounds? Like ravens in a field or something. Just a thought.   Anyway, I love this app and I use it all the time. It might just replace my overpriced therapist!",Love this app!
5,2021-11-08 02:35:33,"This helps me sleep much better than on my own, I also love the other options you can do on the app. But I’ve had problems seeing my published mixes that had 34 likes on it and got removed from the most popular list even though I had more likes that some other mixes.

I have several sound mixes that I created and used to listen to but now I can’t without buying some of the specific sounds inside of those mixes.

I also like that you can have more than one sound going at the same time.",Best for relaxing
5,2020-06-18 13:33:20,"I love how the app allows you to select any sound and adjust the volumes so you can really cater the sound to whatever you desire.

I am not able to afford it so I would really like to her some stories because I tell them to my little brother all the time. This is way better than headspace and Insight Timer.

They updated the app to include a lot more features -  which is great and I could understand charging an additional upgrade fee for the new features. But what they did is lock a lot of the sounds I ALREADY PAID FOR, in addition to no longer allowing me to access meditations (which were also something I paid to unlock previously). Very shady. They should have refunded those of us who paid for the previous “lifetime” unlock OR given us a steep discount on the “new” app. OR just created a new app all together like some others have done once they’ve so drastically changed features and pricing.",Dishonest

5,2017-06-08 06:50:28,I started using this a couple years ago when I was having a lot of trouble with insomnia and it has really helped a lot. I love being able to customize the sounds. And the sounds actually sound natural which is nice. I don't have the pro membership but I am considering it because there are so many resources available. But don't let similar feelings stop you from downloading! The free version has so much to offer!,Love this app!
4,2017-06-24 11:48:32,"I downloaded this app because I have a hard time sleeping since I work various shifts. So far this is the best sleep app of all the ones I've downloaded. I wish that it was accessible from the control center though so I didn't have to always go Into the app but that's minor. I love that I can adjust the volumes of each sound. Since I only use it for sleeping, I haven't bought the premium membership, but I would if I had to. Hopefully there'll be newer sounds to try in the future.",Soundly sleeping
5,2023-11-08 05:43:14,"Love this app so much there is so many options for free! I personally can’t fall asleep without white-noise so it’s really helpful and it’s so easy to just unpause your previous white-noise sound and fall asleep, the sounds are really relaxing and realistic it feels like you are really experiencing your sound and you can make custom mixtures of your fav sounds that are just so relaxing 😌 k, love this app so much 🫶🏼  Please download 🙏",👏✨🫶🏼
5,2023-09-29 07:44:49,"I have paid for the premium a few times. Totally worth it if you enjoy white noise type sounds, there is a huge selection that you can stack upon each other, and change each individual volume level. But if I don’t feel like having the premium, what is just available by default is not bad by any means.   Still using it p",This is a good one.
5,2023-03-09 08:10:20,"I have been having a very hard time sleeping for about a year now. Out of desperation, I downloaded this app in the middle of the night about a week ago. Immediately after picking out a few options that seemed interesting…… I was asleep within five minutes I think.  So grateful for the designers of this app, and I have already recommended it to other people.",Love this app!
4,2023-03-05 07:46:38,"I love this app and use it daily, both to relax and clear my mind, and to drown out a snoring partner. Very user friendly, and good to be able to combine sounds as well to find the perfect fit for my needs. My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that it seems like more are locked now than in the past (I’ve had this app for years). There’s no reason you should have to pay more for a few more simple sounds.",Better Sleep
4,2023-01-30 00:54:40,"I’m really enjoying this app so far.  My anxiety has been higher lately and I need help with falling asleep and staying asleep.  I noticed there aren’t any anxiety focused meditations and I would love to have that and then move on to the letting go of your day meditation.  I’m still trying out all the sounds and I’ve found that I respond to the brown noise, large singing bowl sound and the eternity sound really well. I’m excited for future additions to this app.",Anxiety meditations needed
4,2022-10-08 05:57:08,There is only one thing about this app it is that you have to pay for a few sounds and songs.  other then that it is really good I love it . when I downloaded this app I thought you had to pay to use the app but you don’t.   it has a lot of sounds and songs. you can also make your own play list of sounds all you have to do is pick the ones you like and put it all together and there you go.,Only one thing
4,2022-09-18 14:53:12,It’s good even great but the fact that you have to pay 💰 to get more stuff is not great and it soo much it’s not like 15 bucks is 40 and that’s with a discount is usually 60!!!! Every month you would have to pay 60 bucks for some new sounds! But at least they are actually give you some good sounds and other this but I just wish there was more free stuff or they at least lower there prices to like 20 bucks. Overall is ok 👌🏼,It’s good 🙂
5,2022-03-12 03:51:38,"I love this app! It has helped me with so many things like focus while I’m at work, calming my anxiety, falling asleep and more. It’s just amazing. I would like to offer one suggestion to add the sound of a bald eagle. I hear one early in the morning as the sun rises and late in the evening before I go to sleep and it’s so soothing. It would be great to be able to take that sound with me wherever I go. Thanks for such an awesome app!",The best app ever!
5,2020-11-12 12:30:22,"I tried a bunch of different apps similar to this one, In a spam box of a week . I found that I really liked this among the others . Personally I wish all the melodies where free, but I’m a college student so I think everything should be cheap . No worries though the app does offer some free stuff that you don’t have to pay for at all . In all, I really enjoyed the sleep timer and great quality sounds . Thank you relax melodies.","No melatonin, no worries"
4,2022-03-10 05:33:41,I’m really enjoying my experience so far but I do wish that there was a few more features available in the unpaid version or that it was just straight up advertised as a paid service. Nearly all of the advertised features that drew me to the app are only available in the paid version which I don’t have a problem with but that would have been nice to know going into downloading the app,Enjoying Overall
5,2019-11-04 04:34:50,This app is really good I think. It has a lot of different options and sounds to choose from. You can also set timers and tell you when to go to bed. It even haves sleep yoga and stuff like that to help you sleep. If u could change one thing about this app is to not have to pay. It’s not that much to pay and you do get access to everything but you should have to pay to get a better sleep.,Amazing!!!
4,2020-06-12 03:53:26,I love the stories especially the starship-28 ones. I also really enjoy the sound journeys. The biggest negative is recently there has been some interference with my iPhone alarm in which that alarm doesn’t sound it just shuts off the relax melodies. I have now overslept a number of days due to this issue. I am not sure why it is happening. I restarted my phone and have checked other issues with the iPhone alarm but nothing seems to interfere unless relax melodies is running.,Love the stories!!
5,2019-02-25 17:35:45,I usually don't take time to write reviews but felt this app deserves it.  I have the paid version of this app and have found that it is a great way to help them fall asleep and put myself to sleep quickly.  I have also found that it is a great to teach them about meditation.  They are always adding new stuff to the app and there are so many things I haven't even tried yet.,The paid version is definitely worth it.
5,2018-11-09 18:53:41,"I work over nights so many times it can be difficult sleeping during the day, especially if everyone else is home and making noise. I found relax melodies and I don’t have any problems sleeping anymore. It’s just enough to drown out the noise of the family. It keeps me relaxed and allows me to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. I don’t know what I’d do without it. I really can’t say enough great things about this app",Best sleeps
1,2019-02-04 09:11:03,"I bought the lifetime version of this app one or two years ago for like $20. There were sounds like whales and all the others available.  However, after a certain upgrade, this app has made a lot of things to be in ‘pro’ version. A lot of sounds like whales or binaural beats are no longer available unless you do the pro upgrade, which you need to pay $30 a month or $200 for a full lifetime.  If I were you I would never upgrade the pro version to get everything available, in case they make those to be ‘super pro’ features next time and make you pay $500 for them.",Pro Upgrade required after you purchased lifetime
5,2018-10-29 09:27:54,"I am 32 and have had recurrent insomnia since high school. I have anxiety and ruminating thoughts, including stuck song syndrome. This app helps me to tune out anxious thoughts and be able to relax enough to fall asleep. It’s the only thing I have found that is able to compete with and calm the noise in my brain so that I can rest. I literally use it every night, and I am so grateful for it. Couldn’t recommend highly enough.",First app I’ve ever rated - I love it that much!
5,2018-09-20 15:58:22,"Never one to have to use sleeping aids, or things to lull me to sleep, but now, I couldn’t do w/o my relax sounds!  I started having trouble sleeping a few months ago & someone suggested I use a sound method for relaxing! I did & love the variety of soothing sounds that lull me into the wonders of sleep, relaxation or just downtime!

5,2018-07-18 05:05:47,"I can't go a night without falling asleep to this app. It all started when my fan broke. I fell asleep to the sound of my fan for years and once it was done, I desperately needed something to fill in the silence. I downloaded this app, praying it would help and sure enough, I use it every single night. The setup & quality of this app is very great and I recommend this to anyone that needs noise to fall asleep. There's a special noise combo for everyone!",Best App Ever!
4,2018-08-03 13:48:18,"I love the numerous choices for relaxing sounds. Although the interface is a little busy the main drawback is the frequent pop up requests,e.g. for in app purchases etc. I wear glasses and just want to be able to set up the app on my iPhone dock clock and sleep, read, etc while having the screen show the normal interface without having to fumble for my glasses to dismiss a request before changing or turning off sounds. Otherwise it is great.",Many customizable sound options
4,2018-08-03 08:40:09,"I have had this app for ages, and it’s been interesting to watch as it develops. overall I love this app and would recommend it to others! the sounds are fantastic and help you meditate and sleep, as I’ve definitely fallen asleep to them on multiple relaxing occasions. Besides the need to pay for pro (I am a non-pro user and have never been one,) I recommend this app. I tend to use it for the sounds rather than the meditations, so I have no say in that. If I could, I would give this app a 4.4/5",amazing! if
5,2018-06-21 04:36:14,It is very calming n makes me fall asleep in just about 2-3mins plus the timer function in it is very helpful for the days when u wake up after 5 mins but dont want to reach ur phone to play it again or for the times when u fall asleep n dont want it playing all night.   Variety of musics plus the ability to create a cocktail of music of ur own choice is great. I love it and have been listening to it for two years now.,Best App Ever
4,2018-07-08 20:36:41,"I first downloaded this when i forgot my child’s sound machine on vacation. I love being able to create relaxing combinations other than simple “white noise”. There are some really nice options on here, and they are pleasant and relaxing for me, as well as for the older kids who are outgrowing the white noise options designed specifically for babies. Wish some of the free sounds weren’t quite as similar to others on here, but all in all pleased with selections.",Some wonderful sound options!
5,2018-06-07 06:27:34,I love that I’m able to adjust volume on the different layers of sounds to fit my perfect way to drift off. The timer is a must since I don’t want to have to worry about turning my phone off before bed. And there are plenty of sounds to chose from.

5,2018-05-16 06:57:04,"I used to have a fancy sound machine I used at home for sleep. I started to travel for business and found I could not sleep without the background sounds. One sleepless late night, I had the idea to look for an app and found Relax Melodies. It is great that I can take it with me wherever I go. I love it so much, it has totally replaced my fancy, expensive sound machine. My kids and I love the relaxing body scans as well. Wonderful app!",Can’t sleep without it
5,2018-05-13 04:22:19,I downloaded this app while on vacation. I was having trouble sleeping. This app has many everyday ambient sounds to choose from which you can layer and individually set their volumes. I was able to create a soundscape that very closely simulated the ambient sounds from home. It helped me sleep by tricking my mind into thinking I was at home. This app also has other features that help you relax from binaural beats to a regimen of different sounds with a guide.,Great app!!
5,2018-05-04 06:29:33,"I love this app I’ve been using it for years. You are able to create the most relaxing songs that are perfect for your mode to sleep to at night. I usually toss and turn and wake up about 1 million times a night, but when I use this app I sleep like a baby. Plus it keeps the same study melody all night preventing me from waking up during song changes or commercials. This app is the best for sleep 100% worth it!",Best sleep ever
5,2018-03-04 14:22:40,"I use this app all the time. I love to fall asleep to the sounds of the ocean or a huge thunderstorm and the combinations of sounds you can make seems endless. I love that I can set the timer and just drift off... The meditations are great also, I have used them everywhere. The app is reliable and has never been wonky. I'd love to have the Pro version with all of the additional options but $100 a year is a stressful consideration for me. I just wanna Relax :)",Relax - It's true!
5,2017-09-30 14:00:03,"Not sure how, but with Relax Melodies, I’m more likely to stay asleep.  Great variety of sounds.  Being able to incorporate multiple sounds at varying volumes is something I haven’t found on similar apps.  A nice improvement in a recent update is the ability to set some favorite combinations as saved presets or listen to others' combinations.  I’m going to buy the pro version to show my support of their great app.",Helps me sleep through the night
4,2017-11-23 22:18:20,"Wonderful, versatile app that I've used successfully as white noise to get my little one down for naps and for relaxation for myself.  I appreciate that you can mix and match sounds to your hearts content, and that they continuously play.  The only change I would like to see is perhaps a bit more organization as to the categories of sounds.  I do like that you can save combinations under favorites though.  Overall an awesome choice for anyone looking to soothe a cranky baby or de-stress.",Perfect for baby and mom alike!
5,2017-08-07 04:02:26,"I recommend this to anyone and everyone especially if you suffer from anxiety. It helps you sleep by allowing you to create your own peaceful melodies with tons of sounds to choose from. I literally use it to go to sleep every night. There are so many sounds and adjustments to how loud or quiet they are, and you can save them so if you have a favorite you can save it for later!

3,2023-02-14 04:50:27,"I only continue using this app because I accidentally paid for the yearly subscription, I much prefer Rise sleep tracker as I can actually track my sleep and edit my times. This app is not much of a tracker, it’s extremely simple in those terms. All it lets you do is track on that night, with no option to edit the times or add a previous night if you happened to fall asleep before tracking. It’s more of an app for stories and things to listen to.",Could be so much better 🥲
5,2022-10-18 08:12:42,"Edit 10/18: the most recent app update fixed it and it doesn’t crash anymore.

I haven’t unlocked a lot of the features because I’m still using the free version, but the sounds as I’m falling asleep are definitely helping.

I may upgrade if the next few nights go well.",Early on
2,2021-11-27 19:23:36,"They’ve been charging me for two different subscriptions. And now I’m kind of dependent on the app for my sleep routine. The app is pretty cool, but I honestly only use it for the one “mix” I created and that’s really it. Also, even though I pay for the app, I’m still locked out of certain sounds…. Idk why. And I feel like I’m paying for a LOT of bells and whistles that I will never use. The app itself is I think is a good idea, but they change the format and design of it often and its been getting annoying.",They’ve been charging me for two different subscriptions
5,2021-11-03 04:41:00,My mom has used this app and when I got it it was a life changer. I started of by plating the piano stuff that was on there.

Other wise I would recommend it to anyone who have trouble falling asleep.,Gets me to go to sleep right away

The stories and meditations are super helpful for drifting off to sleep and I definitely feel like I’m getting more rest overall when I use the app.",Such a relaxing experience
2,2021-08-21 03:46:57,"So I have been using Relax Melodies for a few years to help me sleep better with the noises as I can create my own playlists of what noises I want to hear while I am falling asleep. However, whenever I have tried to get onto the app to use it lately, free trial ads continuously pop up and whenever I try to back out, it just takes me right back into it. I also cannot even get into the sounds section to play my playlist, it just keeps me in the music which I don’t use. If you could please fix that, that would be greatly appreciated.",Continuous ‘Free Trial’

Great app, and it brings out your creative side  Newest upgrade allows easy control over each sound added to a mix. Great job.

5,2019-12-14 03:17:19,"I’ve been using this app for over a year now. I can tell the developers have put a lot of time into improving the app as there are many new features like guided meditations, music, new sounds, etc,   While there are more options it now is more restrictive if you’re just using the app for free. The free version is limited to fewer sounds and you don’t have access additional fractures unless you pay for them.",Great App - love the add ons!
5,2019-11-13 05:13:41,I started using this app a few years ago to help me sleep on flights and now it’s evolved into much more! They’ve added so many great features since then and I love it! I not only use it for myself but have been using it for my newborn daughter- it works even better than one of the sound machines we were gifted. There are so many great noises to make your own “mix”.

Its the best investment on an app that I ever done. Right now i am trying the sleep exercises. I fall asleep before the exercise is done. I like that you can set a timer or let it run al night.

I have not found one thing about this app that I don't like... It has even helped my son with ADHD fall asleep & that is a miracle to me!,Love it!
4,2018-05-18 06:09:55,I have used this app on and off for mediations and soothing soundscapes. I especially like the binaural frequencies for reading and studying. I also appreciate the mindfulness and sleep mediations. But I really wish the sounds could be sorted alphabetically and by type. It's hard to find your frequently used sounds unless you create a new favorite and they are sorted randomly with floating icons while it would be super helpful to be able to choose from a list instead.,Great app but poorly organized

I’m so happy I found this app because I can choose from so many sounds and am able to make the perfect mix for me personally to help me relax.

Definitely recommend!",Absolutely amazing
5,2017-09-30 06:04:12,This app is so amazing. You can create your own mixture of sounds to suit yourself and you can make certain ones louder than others. It sounds so real and it's so relaxing. I have it on almost every night because not only does it help me fall asleep in good time but it helps me get a good nights rest throughout the night. I also love how it has a timer and an alarm with the fading in and all of that. This app is great. It's got it all.,Best fricken app ever!
5,2017-09-18 13:41:01,"I purchased this a quite awhile ago and forgot about it. I reinstalled it and started to explore what it was all about and realized why I had it in the first place. The meditations alone are priceless and have what ever mood your in for background music....let's just say...""Awesome!!"" Don't get me started on how fabulous the sleep meditations are as well. I recommend this to anyone and everyone on their spiritual journey....everyone is anyways. Have fun!",It's a must to have this app
5,2017-07-10 05:27:44,"At 66% off I bought the full version because I loved the regular version so much! So many options and sounds! Cool to favorite and share your mixes with others! Insomniacs' aid in nice deep sleep! Get this app and look no further, it is way better than other apps out there and I've tried about 10 even ones for babies because I have difficulty sleeping...this app is insomniac approved! ***Get it while it is on sale!!***",Worth the 4 bucks!
5,2017-06-12 15:04:45,"Having tried several fan apps, I discovered this app which has way more than just fan sounds. It's a rest app especially since it's super easy to use, you can set alarms and timers, and it'll remember your last setting so that each time you open the app, you don't need to search for what you were last listening to. I would definitely recommend this app. I've been using it for years!",Perfect app
5,2017-06-08 04:17:46,"Had this app for almost a year now, and I honestly have no complaints thus far. However, I do wish that with so much usage it would unlock more things after so many days or weeks of using the app. We literally use this app every night before bed. My husband and I love it and our kids really love it - everyone falls asleep in just minutes once it's put on! So relaxing and we especially lOVE the guided meditation!",So far so good!
5,2023-08-30 09:36:31,"this app has helped me get quality sleep after regularly feeling the need to endlessly scroll on tik tok or watch tv till I pass out :/ I look forward to unwinding and being present before resting now, with the help of Better Sleep! I recommend it to everyone I know & I think it has a lot of good options when it comes to sounds and guided meditations",life changing!!
5,2023-08-10 05:24:39,"I love the variety of sounds and stories and meditations in this app. I use it every night to help fall asleep and then, most importantly, when I wake up in the middle of the night. I really feel like the meditations and sounds help me fall back asleep faster when that happens. I’ve relied on this app for several years, and it’s great for when I’m traveling or at home.",Use it every night!
5,2023-08-05 04:33:43,"You can pay and get many sound but there are also many relaxing sounds that make me and my family sleep so well. The possibilities are endless. And you don’t have to use it just for sleep! You can use it to help you concentrate when you read, work, or meditate! I highly recommend this app to everyone. With or without trouble to sleep!",Amazing sleep
5,2023-07-28 13:22:34,"Essential Must Have For Apartment Living!❤️ It's the only app that I have downloaded that gives me so many different, unique, and Wonderful sounds to choose from for Free! I live in an apartment complex. Absolutely Essential in cancelling out neighbors annoying music, barking of dogs, neighbors getting busy, screaming children, and my upstairs neighbor cleaning at 5am. What are they doing up there?!? I'm So Glad I Have This App!!! ❤️",A MUST HAVE Sleep-Aid/White Noise App!!!
5,2023-02-15 19:55:11,I was disappointed about the fact that you couldn't keep the app going while using other apps.  I liked to have my sleep sounds in the backround while listening to a book.  I let them know I was unhappy that they removed that option and then they figured out a way to bring it back and reached out to let me know!  YES!,Great Customer Service!
5,2023-01-30 04:14:41,Better sleep is so good for you when you can not sleep because you play one of the songs and close your eyes and listen to then the song you choose and you will fall  asleep in 5 minutes or less it helps me when I can not sleep I School nights that is why you should download better sleep now if it helps me it can help you to.,Better sleep
5,2022-10-17 03:50:32,"I have had the app for almost two years with great success and suddenly it crashes. It opens, displays the splash screen and crashes. Just so disappointed. Have tried everything to get it to work. Could be the latest iOS update. But the app won’t open.  To be fair it finally opened after about 12 hours of trying.",Suddenly crashes
4,2022-11-01 05:42:00,"I love this app. It helps me sleep really well, and I would recommend this to anyone who has sleeping problems. My only two complaints were that the free membership only has 3 pieces of music. My other complaint was how if you use the sleep recorder, it will have the sound mix you are playing currently on for up to three hours, then switch to like stories and stuff that will wake me up.","I enjoyed this app, but with two setbacks."
5,2021-07-27 08:12:11,Ive used their free service because I’m broke but I see they often have sales for their subscriptions which is cool. I like I can mix and match sounds that can help me sleep better and deeper more often. I wake up super easy to noises and have insomnia but listening to their sound tracks let’s all the other noise remain unnoticed and not wake me up.,Used this for years and it’s super helpful
4,2022-05-20 04:59:29,"I did like the app better before they added all this extra stuff & started charging you per year, where they had the premium app or the basic. I did pay for the premium app because all I wanted was the more sound options, when they ended up changing the app, they took away all the extras I originally paid for. The app does still function well, & the “free” sounds get me through.","Good, could be better."
4,2022-05-17 00:33:08,"I really like the app however I would like to see more new stories. They have pretty much stayed the same in the 5 months I have had the premium package. I like the ones set in present time the best and those are limited. Thanks for telling me how/where to change my sleep goal. Also, if you could incorporate indexes or more specific search criteria to find sounds, stories or meditations that would be great! Thanks!",Variety is the spice of life
5,2021-07-10 00:53:05,I TOTALLY recommend this app it helps me go to sleep in 5 minutes and there are meditations to go to sleep even faster and to get all bad thoughts out of your brain. There is plus that you can buy but it is amazing without the plus. The sounds you can mix and match to find the perfect sound. I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS APP! If u are a person who has trouble going to sleep download this!,AMAZING!!! Read this review
5,2020-06-03 12:00:28,"I’ve had this app for years. I am a deep meditator. Sometimes I just want to be alone in my head or do yoga. The melodies are perfect. Other times I want shorter guided meditations, this app provides me exactly what I’m looking for.  Being able to mix music, sounds, and instruments is fun for the entire family.  Easy to use with kids and adults. Great for meditation, working, and homework. Everyone loves creating and selecting their own favorites.",Get for all
4,2020-12-15 12:33:10,I have been using this app science 2017 and I love it! But I feel that the stories are too limited for the people who don’t have premium. I know that the people who made this app need to make money so they can keep on improving and creating other projects but I feel that there should be some more stories for the free people. This is just me speaking my mind and you don’t need to do this I was just pointing out an issue that I had.,I love this app! But...
2,2020-08-07 02:38:11,"I purchased the app for the year but every night it seems to reset and I have to to go to restore purchase in order to get the full app, and even then it doesn’t always work. I’ve done everything I’m supposed to with my settings on my phone and for the app. I have one other app that I pay a subscription for and haven’t encountered any problems, so I don’t know why this one forces me to restore my purchase every day. It’s making me want to cancel the whole thing and look elsewhere, especially because I want to make sure I’m not being charged several times.","Like it, but annoyed"
5,2019-12-04 03:09:00,"The fact that you can customize the sounds to your preferences is fantastic.  Each sound strikes a different feeling or emotion in an individual; to have so many options makes not only a fun app, but one I return to as moods and needs can change.  Highly soothing before and during bed; so glad I stumbled upon this gem!  The only app I ever have, and will continue to pay for!  Completely worth it!",Sleep support
1,2020-04-16 13:56:48,"I enjoyed this app to the fullest for the first week. I used the most basic features from the nature sounds and water sounds categories, not even the melodies or stories sections. I was about 9 hours after the 12:00am that I meant to downgrade my (now) $60 subscription. Such a shame that the “trial” week includes absolutely every single feature, not even an upgradable $9.99... So you better write it down in several placesthat $60 will be snatched from your account if you forget to be on top of things. I was denied unemployment in my state AND will not be getting a stimulus check. I don’t have the $60 to spend on white noise!!!!!! Extremely disappointed.",Money Grab
5,2019-10-22 01:09:02,"It’s so good for relaxation. I sleep with it every night!! It’s the best app for relaxation or just plain old sleeping apps.. i sleep pretty bad without this app! So i give it a five star rating! I mean they worked hard on the app for all of us, some people just don’t see the beauty in that.. It’s just well you see i hate that you have to pay to just get a relaxation!! But other than that i love the AMAZING app! Enjoy the great app! WAIT i forgot there is no bullying yay!! Alrighty enjoy!!!!",I. LOVE. IT!!!!
5,2019-07-04 21:42:45,"I bought a lifetime membership for the app on Google play 3 years ago. And then switched to IPhone. The company had no problem allowing me access to my full purchase on the new marketplace. And no problem helping me every single time I got a new device, but never set up an actual account. The company is great and the app is amazing. I use it every time I rest or meditate. It’s a staple in my life and the life of my entire household. We love it!",My fave
1,2019-09-20 03:14:25,I’ve actually had this app for years and even paid a “one time” premium to unlock all of it’s advanced features a long time ago but every time there is an update even fewer features are available to the point where less than half of the functions that I was told would be available “forever” are locked behind a subscription pay wall at $60/year. The app works but the fact that every few months it’s functionality decreases and you are forced to pay money to get something back you had before is pretty ridiculous.,Have to pay for any features even if you’ve already paid in the past
2,2019-07-23 12:36:58,"While using Relax Melodies is was a nice app with calming options. Therefore 4 stars would have been given. However, I cancelled my subscription prior to renewal but the app auto renewed anyway in 2018. Called Apple and got the situation rectified and received a refund. Done- I thought!    Summer 2019 comes around and surprise another renewal charged from Relax Melodies.  Still no subscription shows active on either phone connected to my Apple account. My request for refund has been denied.  I don’t know why and have difficulty getting a response.  Beware!  This is not a cheap app and cancellation seems impossible.",Billing and cancellation
5,2019-05-15 03:18:53,"I love the app but some noises are not that realistic which makes it harder for me to sleep 🌙 it may be th audio clip maybe the audio clip is old or out dated and there's a lot of noises but I still feel like there's not many to choose from, in some categories like if there's nature like water , frogs ,and a few others things I can't think of right now also add more sounds I know there are more sounds in the world then that .",Great app
5,2018-10-24 03:28:21,Absolutely wonderful. 👍 Just what the doctor ordered. I have used a sound machine for probably some 25 years. The same 5 sounds get old after awhile. Having access to this app is wonderful.  It helped me after having surgery.  I love having the opportunity to mix several sounds as one sound. Thank you for the people who created these sounds. These have really enhanced my resting and sleeping so much! 😊😴,Relax Melodies: Sleep Sounds
3,2019-04-19 14:12:52,"This app used to be amazing I will use it every night to go to sleep. I have terrible anxiety at night when I go to sleep and the only thing that would help me actually get a good nights rest was my mix of Ocean Sounds and the present mode meditation. I recently updated my phone and the app updated as well and it’s horrible! All my mixes are gone and there are no more meditations I can’t see anything, it says click to find and there’s nothing there.  Please bring back present mode meditation it’s only thing that helps!!!",Horrible update!
4,2018-11-26 02:57:09,"I originally bought this a couple years ago. I have the lifetime subscription. It works in a intuitive manner. It has the sounds that you expect from a noise machine (there is a wide selection of sounds). It needs to improve its category names, having a clock sound in music category doesn’t make sense when I am creating a melody for the night. I would try this product for a week before you consider getting a subscription.",Okay Product
4,2018-11-19 06:05:51,"I live near the train, and falling asleep is hard with the train going by all the time (and my dog gets scared of it too). I thought about getting a noise machine, but this app does the job nicely. The number of sounds is a little overwhelming, and I wish I had access to more options for general soundscapes instead of having to build my own, but overall this app has a lot of options and sounds nice when I pair my phone with my Bluetooth speaker.",Pretty good alternative to a noise machine
5,2018-10-14 03:01:43,"With all of the options and different settings there is something for everyone. Easy to use! I have been an insomniac and have been prescribed ambient for years. The medicine works, but if I wake up I won’t fall asleep. The relaxing sound in the background, keeps my mind from wondering and let’s me get back in to my sleep pattern quickly and easily. It’s a free app and definitely worth a shot.",Great options for anyone’s personality
5,2018-08-08 03:14:23,"While I use this primarily at night, it’s also lovely to listen to anytime of day. When I recognize I’m getting upset or worried, I pick sounds of childhood vacations - frogs, lake waves, and such and can change my mood. I highly recommend this app for anyone. (I’ve been noticing a drop in my blood pressure and my Autistic son will slow down and come out of a meltdown faster with certain sounds, too.)",Just listen and change your mood...
3,2018-09-10 03:41:41,I love this app but the only problem is I had this app for a long time. Bought it along time ago. Had everything unlocked all the sounds and everything. And they changed it for some reason. So I bought it again. Now if you want everything you have to subscribe to their monthly payments. Which is absolutely ridiculous because I bought this App twice already. I like your app but like I said before I already purchased this app twice this is getting a little ridiculous.,Great app but one thing I don’t like
5,2018-08-05 04:00:15,"This app is wonderful. I can have my sounds and or music, have it with or without relaxation and study beats. Also if I need a meditation talk down to relax or sleep to, there’s an option for that. Another great feature I use a lot is making some sounds louder or softer than others. Also it will stay on as long as the app is open so I often will play music from other apps while using this app.",Real personalization
5,2018-07-13 09:53:49,"This app is the best. When I need to sleep, calm down, relax,or just get away from day to day life I just turn this on, find the sounds that will work for me at that moment and it just takes me away to peace. The sounds are natural, not fake. You can adjust the volume of each sound, mix sounds even set a sleep timer. The amount of sounds are great. You can find just about any sound you want. Totally a must have app.",Relax melodies
4,2018-07-26 19:14:44,My 3yr old son is autistic and has a terrible time sleeping. Ever since we bought the app his sleep has continued to improve.  I have chronic fatigue syndrome plus other illnesses that interrupt my sleep. If it’s not playing when I lay down I feel like something is wrong with the house. I turn it on and the relaxation begins.  Truly love this app. It’s a bit pricey because I could buy a sound machine and pay for once rather than renewing every year. So that’s why I give it 4 stars.,How did we ever sleep before?
5,2018-06-17 05:06:43,This app is so great! Without it I would be getting no sleep. I have really bad anxiety and whenever I hear the slightest nose in the night I freak out and can’t sleep this app helps block out those sounds and calm me to a sleeping stage. The one small problem is that there is a small amount of free sounds the rest are pro edition this would be okay with me but the problem is a lot of he free sounds sound the same but otherwise this app is the greatest!,IM IN LOVE BUT...
4,2018-07-05 06:09:43,"This app has a ton of free sounds, although I wish there were a few more that you didn't have to buy. It also has a timer so that the sounds go away after a certain amount of time, and it can even take you out the app if you would like it to. You can save combinations of sounds and adjust the volume of each individual sound in your mix, along with many other cool features. Overall, I think it is a great app that works very well.",Great app!
5,2018-06-10 11:22:25,"I have looked at about 20 apps and I do like this one. I can make my own combinations of sounds. I feel the tension drain away. My 10 year old son has used it on night he just can't sleep. I use it in the classroom during testing or writing times. Its easy to use, timer is super useful so I can fall asleep and not worry, and it's very pretty too. I am going to try another theme of this same app because I enjoy this so much.",I Love this App
5,2018-06-05 14:07:17,"I listen to relax melodies to assist with sleep at night, relaxing in the afternoon and as  background music when doing my morning bible study and prayer time.  I live with a lot of pain, and greatly appreciate having this music at my fingertips anytime day or night!  One of the best things about Relax Melodies is the ability to totally individualize the music and accompanying sounds.  Another one of the best things about Relax Melodies, is that it's free and free of commercials!","Relax melodies, relaxes me!"
5,2018-05-27 07:56:28,"I use relax melodies to maintain a better sleep cycle at home with potential noisy roommates. This works great since I can use the same white noise when I travel. This app makes staying in hotels so much better, it’s much easier to go to sleep with familiar sounds to put my mind at ease. I would recommend this to anyone who keeps waking up in the middle of the night, it helps drown out the noises that could be waking you up.",Better Sleep
5,2018-05-19 06:28:20,It’s crazy but I have used Many different sound apps to help me fall asleep and this one has been the best yet! There’s a bunch of sounds to choose from and you can mix them together. You can even put a bedtime reminder to help you stay on track with sleeping habits. I’ve only used this app for the last week and my sleep has doubled throughout the nights and falling asleep is so much easier,Fell asleep in minutes
5,2018-05-02 02:49:02,"I LITERALLY cannot allen without this app! I’ve been using Relax Melodies since about 2011 & have not stopped ! I’m soooo dependant on this app , without this app playing i’ll toss & turn all night ..just makes miserable.

Thanks guys for such an amazing app ❤️",CANT SLEEP WITHOUT IT!!!!
5,2018-01-02 15:19:56,"I enjoy this app very much so. It is so convenient to be able to put my OWN sounds together, I love to play the app while I’m asleep. The soothing, personalized music intensifies a wonderful, zen sleep. And you can play meditations on top of that! Other apps I tried had meditation guides without music which really threw me off, other apps have 1 minute free meditations but this one offers a variety of beautiful guides to get you going in the AM and wind ya down in the PM. Love Relax Melodies!",Love!
5,2017-12-30 05:34:38,I have downloaded many similar apps but this is far and away superior. Most have several sounds which are short clips that run in a tiny loop. This app's sounds likely also repeat however it is difficult to discern because the clip is long so it sounds natural. And there are so many sounds!  And you can mix them to make your own music. It has so many lovely features. It is the best one of its kind.,Wonderful app
5,2017-10-27 03:04:42,The first night using this app I fell asleep the fastest I have ever in my life. I did a mixture to make it sound like a thunderstorm and snores like a bear! This happened after months of being exhausted but never being able to actually fall asleep and into a deep sleep for that matter. Love it and the timer is great. I wear headphones and after the half hour I am still able to hear if my 5 month old starts fussing. Phew finally some sleep.,First night
5,2017-08-17 02:09:31,"Every single solitary time I go out of town I struggle with sleep. Is there a bathroom fan, static radio station, something, anything? This has literally changed travel for my tweens & I! This app has customizable sounds so we combined oscillating fan and white noise. Set the noise level for our situation and we were out. I get up before the kids? No problem. It plays while I answer texts etc. this literally saved my sleep life!",Finally !!!!!
5,2017-06-27 11:14:24,We are one of those couple's that work hard and play hard so sleep is very important to us! We love adding the sound of the 'oscillating fan' to help us get to sleep faster - now I can't sleep without it!! I have also used several of the sea and rain options while getting a massage - always help mask the sound of a battery operated clock and leads to deeper relaxation. Great app! Thanks for making it available.,A great night's sleep!
5,2017-06-11 05:03:43,"The ability to combine sounds to create a vibe that's exactly what you like and what's soothes you gives this app 5 starts for me. Not only that, but there are endless options for sounds that you're able to play. If you want a thunderstorm and you want wind and rain hitting the roof of your home you got it. If you're like me and benefit from white noise, download this app right away, you won't regret it!",I use it every single night!
5,2023-03-20 09:18:17,"Soundscapes are what I’m here for. Several sounds are available even when free. They loop endlessly (unless you set a timer) and, from my observation, seamlessly. They’re all high quality and, in my opinion, soothing. You can mix up to 15 loops and adjust each sound’s volume or set them to fluctuate. No ads, either (I likely would delete the app if there were).",Free version suits my needs 🙏
2,2023-09-08 15:21:48,"This has been my go to app for years to help with my insomnia.  I love the playlist feature and the ability to mix stories, meditation and sounds.   I would have bought the app if that was an option, but I won’t do subscriptions.   One of the reasons I used to recommend this app is that it was one of the few functional for free.  That is changing and more and more of the formerly free features and stories are now subscription only.   So I’ve switched to my back up app and deleted this one.",Removing free sounds/stories to force subscriptions
5,2023-03-11 14:55:15,"I really love this app and the company itself. I used one of their older apps for years and switched over to this one about a year ago.   With the last apple iOS update however, it seems to have blocked the api from executing the alarm clock. Not sure if I should reach out to apple and tell them to stop blocking reputable companies like this.",Love the app but Apple messed up the alarm clock
5,2023-02-13 18:51:38,"Love that they still have options for those who can’t pay for it like myself. My favorite feature is that you can customize and mix sounds for yourself and adjust the different volume of all of them and once your happy with it you can save it for later in your favorites! This app has really helped me with my anxiety, thank you♥️",Customizable
1,2023-03-03 06:06:27,i remember when this app used to be free. i would use the cat purring sound with the oscillating fan and i would sleep so well. now they make you pay for sleep recording and the sounds? great idea but i wish someone would offer something like this to help people sleep for free!! i have had trouble sleeping every night for years. i wake up several times throughout the night and it takes me about an hour to fall back asleep every time. along with terrible nightmares every time i actually do fall asleep. if anyone knows an app that could help me with this for free please let me know!!,Needs to be free!!!
5,2023-01-24 09:55:27,"I’ve been using this for a long time, even back when it was Relax Melodies. My husband and I both sleep much better listening to the running water of a river and add in a few more elements to create the perfect balance of rhythm to lull us to sleep in no time. We once used it while we were guests at my brother’s house and he and his wife heard it and thought they had a water leak. Lol",Love this app!
5,2022-09-04 04:51:50,Most app allows you very limited sounds but this app is so different it has many sounds you can add on to and make your sound. It even has frequencies pitches you can add or listen to. Stories you can listen to. But this app is a must download and give it a try! My kids and I enjoy this app.  I haven’t how ever subscribed to it but so far so good. Will review in a month.,Most sleep induced app ever
5,2022-05-31 04:55:40,"I was fortunate to find this wonderful Gateway to distress, relax, meditate even listening to bedtime stories. The nature sounds alone are fabulous then you can combine with music that all flows together so seamlessly. I have tinnitus and this app makes my condition non-existent.

I can't sleep without noise so BetterSleep is extremely helpful and I use it nightly. When I don't use BetterSleep I can't sleep. Recently they removed the multiple alarms which annoyed me some as I've been using the alarms or countdowns to wake up. Other than that I adore this app 💙,Used for years
5,2022-02-23 11:54:35,"I hadn't used it in a while, but I am so glad that I revisited it because the sleep time stories have been so helpful (I particularly love the Story of Tea 🫖).

3,2022-05-05 06:07:59,"Downloaded this app many years ago before I deployed. The white noise was a sleep saver. Unfortunately, a lot of the great options have been put behind the paid subscription and now it’s a very limited app. Can’t run a business for free, I get it.

1,2022-04-28 05:47:30,"This app has become absolute trash since it became “Better Sleep”  I can’t listen to the in-app music/meditations WITH the sounds unless the sounds are coming directly from my phone’s speakers.   The app crashes most times I try to set or delete timers.   Some of the sounds don’t work occasionally and I end up having to close the app and reopen it several times in order to get them to work again.   Seems as though the quality of some of the sounds has been lost/degraded, as they do not sound as well as they used to.   The feature that automatically adjusts the volume of the sounds is broken and requires restarts of the app or my phone in order to get them to work.   There are more issues, but none as bad as these.   Please fix. I have the lifetime membership from when this was Relax Melodies and I am really feeling as though that was a bad investment I made almost three years ago now.",Bring Back Relax Melodies

I've recently been diagnosed with tinnitus, and suffer from bouts of insomnia .. this app helps drown out the tinnitus and relax my mind so I can sleep much better. It's difficult for me to sleep without it now... the music, stories, and background sounds work so well together. I love this so much I have purchased the lifetime premium subscription…Absolutely amazing",Amazing App- Best in its class
5,2022-01-06 02:41:29,Absolutely love this app. Used it for over 3 years now and I cannot sleep without my “rain sounds.” The meditations are great as well. I suffer from insomnia and anxiety and this app has absolutely helped me fall asleep or get back to sleep faster. Also had an experience with my purchase not being restored correctly and app support was quick to help and it was resolved quickly.,Love it!!
5,2021-12-09 00:54:04,"Best app I’ve ever used and well worth a yearly subscription. I fall asleep SO EASILY after battling insomnia for so long. Once I started listening to the mediations, I can fall asleep within 10 minutes and it’s the most relaxing/constant sleep. Being able to customize some sounds mixes while also having brainwaves to add in is a huge bonus!!!",I’ve been using this app for 3/4 years!!!

This used to be my go to app for white noise at night, but the new update removed the ability to set a time at which the noise will stop playing, and now only provides the ability to stop after a duration of time.

The moment it turns on, you become incredibly relaxed. Within minutes you are asleep. It has so many soundscapes to choose from, and is not just limited to sleeping. There are many other beneficial relaxing techniques available. Highly recommend this app!",Great sounds

5,2018-10-16 06:05:32,"I’ve tried other white noise apps before but they often only play for an hour before they stop. This one plays all night and is very easy to use. You can combine sounds (rain and thunder, river and frogs, etc) and there is a good variety of sounds, even in the free app that you can choose from (nature, animals noises, city sounds) You can make favorite combinations and save them for future use.",Plays all night
5,2018-08-20 17:43:28,This app is amazing there is a larger sound selection and you can mix and match them so the possibility are unlimited. Then there are added selection of sound which are meditation noise and  binaural beats that you’ll need headphones for. The number of different thing you can do is infinite and there an pro objection that just furthers the bliss of using this app I don’t have that so just imagine the other possibilities you’ll have.,Speachless Blissfulness
5,2018-07-31 05:03:58,"I decided to get the paid version of this app because it offers a good selection of sounds & music that you can mix into your own mixes, and it also offers a very good selection of guided meditations for different purposes. Also the price is good for what you get compared to other similar apps. I do wish they had more crickets and a different types of birds to choose from, but I’m sure later they will add more.",Very diverse
5,2018-07-23 02:32:43,"I downloaded this app as a filler when I didn’t have my fan one night, but now I use it instead of my fan! I haven’t upgraded for any of the locked sounds, but they have a large assortment of sounds for free! I also love that you can mix how loud or quiet each noise is within the sound and that you can save different mixes for different nights. I haven’t tried the relaxation meditations yet, but I plan to soon!",worth it
5,2018-07-07 00:37:49,Love how you can choose your favorite nature sounds to overlap and save the mix.  I have multiple favorites that I cycle through to keep variety.  The natural sounds help my brain relax so that I fall asleep faster.  Customer service is great too.  I had a problem with one of the updates that installed.  The developers response to the issue was quick and best of all it worked so that I can use all of my mixes again.,Great app
5,2018-07-05 06:45:20,This app keeps me from staying awake during the wee hours of the night when I wake up and used to not be able to go back to sleep.  Total relaxation occurs and I am drifting off and calming down nicely.  It's as if I am in yoga with a great instructor calming me down.  Well worth all the in app purchases also.  Restores your peace of mind.  My six year-old niece asks to use this app when she stays at my house on the weekends.  She loves the calming effects too.,Cure For Insomnia
5,2018-06-17 14:12:53,"I loved the free app, but couldn't stand it-I had to buy it!!! No regrets!!! I can get the sound of the ocean, the calm of a country night with peep frogs and a light wind. I can even get the sound of a distant train-something I grew up with! You won't regret buying the app for full access! SWEET DREAMS!!!  ***Also, the meditations are AWESOME!!! UPDATE—Still using this app!!! My grandson is 6 months old, and when he’s fussy and sleepy, I’ll put on a relaxing combo of sound, and he’s out like a light in no time!",BEST SLEEP IN AGES!

You can make your own melody, even if you are on the free version, they still give you a lot of options. I love the meditations and that you can listen to one while playing a melody. I just wish a few more meditations were available for the free version, or at least offer some meditations free for a limited time.",Pretty Impressed
5,2018-04-14 04:36:59,The amount of sounds is amazing and I love the fact that you can mix sounds together. The best part is the amount they offer for FREE is amazing. Really reasonable price for the pro. Only reason I won’t purchase pro is because there’s not even a 10sec sample of the sounds so to me I don’t know if it’s worth it. If I could sample the sounds and know there were a bunch I’d use I’d purchase the pro version immediately! Still a great app overall!,Great app
4,2018-04-22 05:22:43,this app is our go to when putting our 2 year old and 3.5 year old to sleep during naptime and bedtime. It drowns out a lot of the outside noise and the tv as well. I cannot even sleep without it. Some of the slower humming noise really makes my mind and eyes heavier. I have it on right now and I’m getting super sleepy! Melatonin does not drown out my thoughts and I’ve tried L-theanine which helps. But I’d rather not get dependent on those and just listen to this instead...,Been using it ever since I had my first born
5,2018-02-21 20:31:25,This app is amazing!!! I I love how you can integrate all the sounds together to form new stuff to listen to at night. I had a hard time sleeping but after using the app I can easily fall asleep quickly now thanks to the soothing sounds that I can choose from. Also great for my daughter who was also having a hard time falling asleep in the evenings but now after using the app quickly falls asleep without any trouble.,Awesome app
5,2018-01-08 21:02:11,Absolutely love this app. It really helps my 2 month old fall asleep and stay asleep MUCH longer. Also helps my 2 and 3 year olds rest well. We love to mix white noise with rain and sometimes the ocean waves as well! Perfect for traveling when you don’t have the sound machine with you. We even Bluetooth through the car speakers when we just want everyone to GO TO SLEEP!!! Family sharing capability is also a plus!,Love this app!
5,2017-11-11 22:33:46,"I use this app every single night to help me sleep! I use different sounds at night too! Sometimes I turn my fan on, & then just use the app to play some rain or campfire or mix a few sounds together for the ultimate relaxation! The heartbeat & oscillating fan work great to help my nephew stay asleep as well! I play them along with our fan at home so he can block out all other noises as well as feeling the air!!! Works great! 😊",Love this app!
4,2017-12-29 22:43:21,"I was recommended this app by my mom because I suffer from insomnia. I was skeptical because I've tried sound/music apps or machines before and didn't like them. This has a wide variety of sounds and the quality of the sound is good. I love how you can add and mix to make the sound just the way you want it. Another great feature is it allows you to set a timer so it will turn off by itself, so you don't have to worry about draining your battery.",The Best Sound/Music Sleep App
1,2017-12-03 02:19:45,Have been incredibly happy with the app until tonight which was unusually challenging to get our little boy to sleep. The app along with some cradling and rocking for a long while finally got him to sleep and we set the timer for 30 minutes of lullaby music to make sure he wouldn't wake. About 10 minutes into the timer a Land Rover ad went off which was not only incredibly loud it was also the furthest thing from relaxing I've ever heard! It caused our little guy to not only wake up but jump up in fear and made it even harder to get him back to sleep. I will never buy a Land Rover and if I owned one I would gladly drive it into a lake after this event.,Advertising
4,2017-06-21 03:11:15,I downloaded the app. because I was having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. The nights I slept like a rock were also not satisfying. The app helped me fall asleep faster and stay asleep. I went from waking up 20x in a night to only maybe twice and usually not until after about ) hours of sleep. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because many of the sounds are cheesy or repetitive and now completely realistic or customizable in terms of intensity.,Better nights sleep
5,2017-06-17 04:32:07,"I have been using this app for over 5 years, maybe 6, almost every single night. I she recommended it to every person I know.

5,2022-04-29 04:21:57,"Originally got this to help get our baby to sleep. And then to stay asleep. She’s quite a bit older now but we still use it, and I use it for myself on many occasions.

4,2023-01-28 18:16:13,I love better sleep there’s just a couple of things that I don’t like first of all there is a long survey before you use the app and you have to pay for the app after 7 days it can be very relaxing but at the same time just a bit creepy because one of the sounds is elvish whispers and like who would like to hear whispers while trying to sleep but that’s my rating hope you will consider this,Ups and downs
1,2022-10-26 05:10:16,"The recent updates have become a nuisance. They added a Discover pane and if you are connected to a speaker via Airplay, it just starts looping a part of a meditation, play/pause doesn’t stop it, only killing the app does.  The app will sometimes load without the Discovery pane and then the sounds work over Airplay again.  This on top of the fact that mixes that include Music/Meditations and Sounds have NEVER worked together over Airplay is extremely frustrating. If you select Music or a Meditation, it only plays the music or meditation without the sounds. I don’t get why Airplay is such an issue for this app.  I love this app and have used it for many, many years, but recently it’s become so frustrating to use when it supposed to be calming.  I have contacted support about the Airplay mixing issues, but they still haven’t fixed the it.  If they fix these problems I’d consider this five stars.",Recent updates keep breaking things

I was recommended to try using a sound app that could give noise so my mind wouldn’t dwell on the small noises in my room instead only hearing the sound or water or white noise.  I started using this and it’s easily become apart of my nightly routine and thanks to it I have a much clearer mind and I can finally get all of the sleep I’ve been missing out on.,Great for Insomniacs

I love waking up in the morning and getting ready while carrying around a rainstorm and a cat softly purring. Makes for a pleasant sleep and a soothing morning routine. This may not be the best for you so there's also a timer to shut it off after you've fallen asleep!",Can't say enough good things!
5,2018-01-04 05:24:01,"Even without paying for premium features, this app is extremely helpful and calming. One can make their very own mix of sounds, even adjusting the volume of each individual sound, and then save this mix. One of my other favorite features is the community melodies section, in which one can find highly rated mixes created by others. Overall, great app with no flaws I can see.",Fantastic App
5,2017-10-08 10:15:24,"I have bipolar and severe noise sensitivity. When my mind is racing and the city sounds are irritating me, I turn to this. A huge selection of options to make nearly any combination you can imagine. The ability to adjust the volume on individual noises is also, frankly, a life saver. It's also good for relaxing in a bath, meditation, whatever suits you. It's also very intuitive and easy to use. Two thumbs up!",Just what the doctor ordered
5,2017-09-19 12:55:10,"Incredible app! I got this in hopes it would hold us over until we got our sound machine, needless to say I fell in love with the app and all of the sounds and noises. We decided we didn't need to waste money on a sound machine when it wouldn't offer even half of what we have on this app! My baby sleeps so sound and takes much better, much needed naps. Thank you for giving us the gift of sleep!",My sleeping Baby thanks you!!
5,2017-08-15 06:44:59,"I got this app because of the recommendation of a friend, I've been dealing with some pretty bad anxiety that was making it hard for me to relax and go to sleep. I love that it has so many sound options, and that I can make my own mixes of them and set it on a sleep timer. I created a couple different blends and have used it every night since I got it, and it's helped me be able to relax a little and doze off.",Pretty helpful
5,2017-06-18 15:32:42,"I have got to say not only do my boyfriend and I love this app so much, because it puts us to sleep and helps us sleep well throughout the night, but our new puppy Luna loves it to. I turn it on and minutes later she's snoozing Hahahaha. So if you're looking for a really good app, with sounds of nature that actually sounds REAL and REALLYYYY work, then get this one. I promise you won't be sorry. Babies have lullaby's, us adults have the sweet calming sounds of nature. Mmmmm.",Absolutely amazing.
5,2023-08-13 16:29:24,"Absolutely love this app. It is well worth the money, and it has so much variety of stories, meditation and sounds to help you fall asleep. I especially love the ones where they take place in cold climates especially in this brutal heat. I have one suggestion. Can Gizmo and Udo go on an adventure together? Like maybe to Northern Maine or Iceland. They can meet the local animals like lobsters and Puffins. 😊",Udo and Gizmo need to travel together
5,2022-12-21 04:16:50,"I have really been enjoying the Better Sleep app. Other sleep apps weren’t working for me because every night I didn’t need the same type of relaxation. Better sleep is all encompassing insofar as choices for whatever you may need - a story, meditation, sounds, even a full body relax to prepare for sleep. This is a one stop app for all your needs.",Best good nights

Facilitates great sleep and meditation as one of the many features.",Great App! Love How Many Sound Options There Are!
5,2022-10-06 12:29:43,What I love about this app are the various sounds available and that you can mix and match them! (Well some shouldn’t be put together) but the information in the app explains that!  I can click on any sound and get the data on it. You can combine solfeggio frequencies with green noise and/or Tibetan bowls and understand the effects. I slept like a baby the first time trying it.,Soothing
5,2022-09-24 03:43:37,I have been using the better sleep app for several years now. I still use it every single night. I love that I get new meditations and stories often and the selection is wide. The customer service has been outstanding. I got a new phone and needed help getting my downloads back. The response was quick and solved my problem.,Wonderful
5,2022-01-26 13:33:35,This app was sent from the heavens. Being able to mix and create your own sounds to set up the vibes before entering the dream world is absolutely magnificent. I’ve recommended this app to so many other people because it’s truly something to write home about. it’s called BetterSleep for a reason. If I could rate ten stars I would. And I DON’T give ratings often.🤍,I use this app religiously
4,2022-08-20 15:01:55,"The app is wonderful, I love it. The problem is  I have to purchase a subscription for more than one person to share it with my children. I have preteens with sleep problem and don’t want to leave my device with them to help them go to sleep. I tried going into apple to share the subscription but it won’t let me family share it. It’s too expensive for a family to use.",Premium good for only one
3,2022-03-30 14:16:30,"Better sleep is a good app, but there are some bad things about it. I try to find meditations on it and almost all of them are locked. I will have to use money to be able to get to use them. And whenever there is a lock on something like a sound either, i have to use money. So if the creator is seeing this, i would like to not have so many locked things. I know its your way of making money, but dont have so many locked. Maybe only have a few.",Good!
5,2022-01-11 04:22:28,"Free & easy to use. Great variety of sounds. I love that they have playlists to choose from, or you can custom make your own. I especially love the new feature where the sounds can fade in and out - so many different dynamics. Something for everyone! Plus mediations, timers, and so much more. It really is amazing it’s free. I’ve used it for years, and they just keep improving it!",Perfect Sleep Aid
5,2022-01-01 07:14:01,Usually I’d give this a 5star and I’ve paid for the full year for years now.  But with the new update I haven’t been able to enjoy the app no more. It just crashes and buffers with some meditations and stories. I thought it was my phone so I restarted it and no results. Updated it and no results. Please can I have my money back? I’m not enjoying it no more :/,Bug
5,2021-04-21 20:46:16,"When I downloaded the app for a free trial, I had problems accessing some of the content.

The app was recommended by a medical student after I had complained about difficulty going to sleep.",Outstanding Customer Support
5,2021-03-27 02:55:01,"I really like this app and I am so glad that you can make your own melodies on this app. I would recommend this app if you have a hard time falling asleep. I am a little mad (not really) that they only have one white noise to pick from if you aren’t using the paid version. I do have one suggestion tho, do you think you could add sleep tracking to this app? I think it would make it a package deal.",So peaceful 😴😌
5,2021-03-02 05:54:02,"I liked the free version so much I paid for a year subscription, and I couldn’t be happier with the purchase. My favorite parts of this app are probably the meditations and the stories, my mind races at night, I can’t stop thinking about negative or stressful things in my life. The meditations and stories distract me from my own thoughts and I’m almost always asleep before a single meditation or story ends.",The best app ever for chronic trouble sleeping and stress!
5,2018-10-28 03:28:47,"The only problem I have with this app is that I’m getting dependent on it to fall asleep. I don’t have trouble falling asleep but the sounds relax me and living in a new apartment I like having familiar sounds every night. Love the quality of the sounds, the loops are sometimes annoying and sometimes helpful when falling asleep. Depends on the night. Great that you can save your favorite mixes and the timer option.",Love this app!
4,2020-06-18 04:27:00,"I couldn’t sleep well or go to sleep easy and was going to get a melatonin sleep health thing then found this app and it helps me out so much, you can customize what sounds you want to help you sleep, like I personally hate storms and thunder and don’t like white noise but they do have a calm rain and river and an ocean sound so I use a mix of those, usually just rain and the ocean waves coming in on the tide on a low volume and I sleep so easy, not too distracting like music or anything",Sleep
1,2019-09-04 20:40:54,"Please do not even bother with the free trial of this app. The app itself was decently fine. It was not all I expected so I did not plan to keep it. Instead of allowing me to cancel the free trial the day it was up, they charged me triple what the price chart said I would be charged for a year of this app. No one will give me a refund even though it is on the basis of false advertisement.  I would not be upset if I had been charged the listed amount since I did wait until the last day to cancel it. However, being over charged is not okay. Please be careful of this app!!! There are many free ones that do just as much and won’t cost you a whole paycheck.",DO NOT BUY.
2,2018-12-12 11:59:18,It used to help drown out the other noises and help me stay or fall asleep...but lately after about 15mins it just turns itself off. There are no timers set nothing changed just started turning it’s self off. Which is really fun when you’re just about to fall asleep and it shuts off and you eyes long open. Or it’ll stay on and about two hours before you are supposed to wake up it turns itself off. Like I said I haven’t had anything on or had a problem until about a week ago...I am now trying the remove and re-download...hopefully that will work!,Used to be great
5,2018-10-24 05:55:24,I had two apps similar to this that Have been deleted since my download. The variety of sounds that are free are so great that it's become my number one app for sleep and meditation! Very highly recommended.  👍🏽👍🏽⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I have noticed when I wake up throughout the night I will recognize the sound of rain and soft waves and then drift back to sleep in a way that I don’t when the app is off at night. I love it!,Love it!!!
4,2018-10-03 04:45:19,"The sounds are extremely pleasing and sound very realistic. I haven’t had any problems with the app. As much as I don’t like it to affect a rating, I’m not fond of how much of of the sounds are under “pro”. Although I understand that there has to be money coming from somewhere, I’ve just never enjoyed feeling restricted and wish there were more sounds to choose from. Overall, great app and would recommend to anyone looking for simple sounds!",Good app to sleep to!
5,2018-08-28 21:19:14,"This app is exactly what I needed. I love the flexibility of creating my own combinations and testing them out to suit my need. I have a very stressful job and they’re working on the roof of my building right now. Serenity is needed! PLUS no sub!! Huge bonus as so many relaxing sounds apps charge outrageous fees, especially the ones that charge $60/year. No thanks. This app has lots of things you can pay to unlock, but they’re all optional.",So perfect
5,2018-08-11 03:05:44,So I’ve had trouble sleeping the past 6 months because of some traumatic experiences that just happened and I saw this app on my phone in the App Store. I decided to check it out and see if it worked and it really really works. Anytime I’m feeling anxious or I can’t sleep I just listen to this app and pick whatever kind of sounds I like the most and before you know it I’m relaxed!! Love this app I highly recommend it :),Amazing
5,2018-07-17 09:56:08,"This app is amazing. Mostly because it actually does what it supposed to do. The free version has so many features. It gives me the choice to choose my own comfort and pick my own sounds. It also has a bedtime reminder, timer, alarm, etc.  It relaxes me and helps me fall asleep which I have trouble doing . If you have trouble falling asleep or just need to relax, this app definitely will help with that.",best app for falling asleep!
4,2018-08-01 11:32:31,"I love that you can mix and match the sounds and their volume levels, I only wish that the sound files were longer so it wasn’t so obvious that they were looping. Especially if you’re using this because you have trouble sleeping like I do, when the sounds become something you try to focus on to relax thoughts at night, the pattern in the sounds become apparent, unfortunately. Still regularly using the app 🤙 🧠 🌙","Love the variety, but one reservation.."
5,2018-07-03 04:07:40,"I discovered this app to help my grandchildren when they were babies to sleep. I found that when I was in their room I relaxed and got sleepy too. So I started using it to help me sleep whenever I'm stressed and my mind is whirling, or I wake up in the night and can't go back to sleep, or I'm traveling and need to mask the new sounds of the place. I love that there are so many different sounds to choose from even in the free app.",Great Sleep Help
4,2018-07-04 13:12:20,"I love playing with the combination of sounds of this app, and to be honest so does my 2yr old granddaughter. I use some combinations when I’m reading or painting or simply need to talk myself down after watching too much politics! (Primal scream!!!) As a devoted Grammy, I love the Lullaby and ocean sounds when I watch our newest family member who chills out when I turn them on! The app is simple to use and straightforward - I haven’t bitten the bullet to buy it but that prob includes great features too.",Multi Purpose enjoyment!
5,2018-06-28 19:25:10,I was introduced to this app at work... a baby I was taking care of slept only to the sound of the vacuum cleaner running.  This app was the only one we could find with that sound.  I’ve used it for each family I work for and have created unique mixes for each baby.  I use it when I’m in a waiting room and want to be able to focus the book I’m reading.  I really love all the options!,Love this app
5,2018-06-22 03:24:43,"perfect background noise. I occasionally use this app as I'm studying.  I've tried to use it to help myself sleep, but I'm just a person who has to have absolute silence. If you like noise, it will probably work perfect for you.  The ability to mix and match sounds is absolutely perfect. You're able to choose what sort of relaxation experience you're feeling that day or moment! Seaside? Cozy home? Spring garden? All possibilities!",fun app
5,2018-05-24 06:40:51,"I am a light sleeper and have used many tools over the years to help me get to sleep as well as stay asleep. I love this app as it gives me the perfect combinations of sound that I need on any given night. Sometimes I am 100% rain, other times I want wind and sometimes a combination of both and add in some orchestra.  I get it all here and I love how I can add on sounds to create the blend that works for me and my mood.",Can’t sleep without it
4,2018-06-18 05:34:02,"This helps me sleep at night and so far it's been helping me practice my meditation! I'm just a bit disappointed that the lowest price is to the smallest amount of time for the upgrade. I believe that maybe you should lower the prices a bit more than they are now, because people should have the freedom to access all of the sounds and meditation programs instead of two measly meditations and 1/3 to 1/2 of the available sounds for free.",Thanks! But work on the pricing a bit.
5,2018-05-23 09:27:57,"The free version gives you free range to make many sounds/mixes for your comfort! It also has guided meditation options (which I love). The pro version opens an even larger window with binaural beats, isochronic tones and a larger scale of sounds and guided meditations. Did I mention it has a timer you can set so the sounds go off as you sleep and an alarm to wake you up?! This app is amazing for free and EVEN better when you go pro!",Relaxing
5,2018-05-21 06:47:50,I have searched and used a lot of Apps for white noise and background tones to help fall asleep and none have been very good.  This app has an enormous sound library and the ability to layer different sounds and also vary their volume individually. You can save your creations and use others’.

I'm actually in my 20s and a website developer--so it's more like I'm broke and living on love and a good budget.  I really support this app, it's help me sleep so much better and lessen my anxiety.

5,2023-07-22 02:51:19,"The BEST part of this app is you can independently lower the volume in the app to listen to sounds to sleep to and still have a louder volume set on your main phone for your alarm in the morning.

1,2021-10-06 16:09:36,This app is fantastic when it works. Which isn’t all that often for an app that is supposed to help you “sleep better and stress less”. There have been many times - including just now - in which the sounds stop on their own even though the timer is still going. Sometimes - like just now - it stays on less than a minute and just stops. It’s incredibly annoying. Sometimes it stops hours before the timer and wakes me in the middle of the night. I have to restart my phone at 3am just to get it to work again. It’s garbage. Don’t pay for it.,Great!…When it works.

It used to be completely free with an amazing mix of sounds. I understand charging maybe 3-5$ for it, but $20 a year recurring charge or $199 lifetime? Hell no. That’s robbery and ridiculous. Now they just keep making the best sounds “PRO”, and these that used to be free now have to be bought. Won’t be long before nothing is free and they lose even more customers. Don’t bother. Find yourself another app. I’ve reduced my review from 5 stars to 2.",Money hungry
4,2018-11-18 04:59:44,I like the variety of sound options. It’s also great that you can layer sounds and the sounds will play over your other music apps. I often play the rain sound while listening to classical on Pandora- makes a great study environment.   The only thing I found negative is some sounds loop too quickly and you can pick up a pattern. It would be better if they were a bit more organic or natural.   Wish the upgrade wasn’t so pricey!,Mostly good!
5,2018-11-09 05:15:52,I got the app to help myself relax at the end of the day and fall asleep.  My kids love it just as much as I do.  I really like the ability to save mixes.  The kids made a mix that sounds like our backyard at night with the windows open and we play it when we are on travel in a hotel. Works like a champ to get them asleep!  My other favorite thing about the app is the timer function.,Great to fall asleep to!
5,2018-11-07 05:42:51,"love it so much! all of them!! they help me sleep when i’m stresses or have anxiety. i have to admit some sounds are creepy to me but i get scared easily. they have really nice mixes of sounds that a lot of people like. i’m a fan of a lot too :) if you haven’t already, you should definitely download this app to loosen out or to fall asleep. i love how you can make your own sounds too! i’m really happy my dad showed me this app!:)",The app in general!
5,2018-07-30 04:07:59,"I keep forgetting how helpful this app is for me.  I used to live in NYC, and having to rain and urban sound became a part of my sleeping.  Now I live in a quiet neighborhood and it's hard to sleep in silence.  This app provides not only the sound I miss but also when stressed I can use it for meditating too.  Download this app and the extras like links to healthy articles are free too!  Get some great sleep, and improve your health.",I need to use it more!
4,2018-10-31 06:10:55,"I like it for when I’m out of town and need to drown out the sounds of an unfamiliar place. I do have one complaint however, which is that I can’t play the deluxe sounds at all just to see what they sound like and decide if I want to purchase the app instead of only using the free ones. If I could hear each one for even 7 seconds to see what they’re like I might buy the app to gain full access but I wouldn’t spend money on something I am not sure I’d like.",Good
4,2018-10-14 09:15:05,"I love this app.  I have used it many times when I can’t seem to settle my mind down and need to find calm and relaxation.  It typically helps me fall asleep quickly.  It has especially come in handy when traveling since I am used to falling asleep with the noise of a fan, and hotel rooms tend to be far too quiet for me to fall asleep.  I also love how you can mix sounds together and adjust the volume of each so that you can customize your ambiance.",Great ambiance for falling asleep
5,2018-07-13 05:58:54,This app is wonderful. I love the practically limitless combos of sounds you can make. I change it up from time to time depending on what I feel like. I also love that you can save your mixes for future use and that each sound’s volume can be adjusted individually. I only have the free version and I’m very happy with it. Especially helps to drown up my husband’s snoring on bad nights. Very relaxing; I love it.,Has saved me many nights
5,2018-07-05 10:55:24,I’ve used sound/sleep devices before. The problem is you are stuck with the same thing with every one of them. One redundant loop that after a while you learn where the loops end and that becomes a distraction to relaxing.   The fact that you can stack and mix sounds and levels is amazing! I get to play with sounds until I find what makes me feel free!  Game changer!,Great sound combinations
5,2018-06-02 05:34:28,I really like the variety of sounds and the volume in which you can control what you hear most or least. You can choose your favorites sounds and save them. It has the option to turn the sounds off at a certain time. I'm very happy with the app and turned my husband on to going to bed with the different and soothing sounds. I use it every night.,Really like this app
4,2018-06-28 14:35:23,"You guys took away the volume control bar in the app or at least hid it where I can’t find it. So half the time when I turn on the noise machine it blast really loud till I can turn it down with the iPhone volume control. Not very peaceful or relaxing, especially for my spouse late at night. I can’t adjust the noise volume before turning it on because it changes the ringer volume. Please fix this.",One issue with last two updates: volume control.
5,2018-04-12 04:27:54,"My boyfriend recently moved for a new job, and I had to remain in another city for a few months until my contract at work runs out. He sleeps with a fan and our cat sleeps on his pillow. I only allowed the fan because he kept me warm, but I grew used to the sounds, and without them, I was finding it harder to sleep. This app has the perfect fan sound and PURRfect purring. It’s not as good as the real thing, but I love it!",This might sound lame but...
5,2018-03-29 04:37:29,"Was recommended by a friend - I'm glad they did. sometimes have a hard time falling asleep/winding down after a full day, and this is just the thing to help out with that. Also- lots of good options included for sound bytes, and you can layer them to tailor it to yourself. There's an extension to the track ""library"" but it does cost monies (affordable, like 2-3 bucks?) For what it's worth. Do I sound like an infomercial yet..",Great sleep machine
5,2018-03-22 23:43:21,"I have trouble sleeping. With having to wake up at 0500, it seems near impossible. I guess I’m a weird individual. But I can’t sleep with silence. I need some kind of peaceful noise if that makes any sense haha 😆. This application works wonders. I prefer the highway noise. However you can choose what works for you, and even select multiple ones at one time to mix ‘em up. You’ll be sure to find your sleep remedy with this app. GOODNIGHT💤😴🌙",Great app for veterans
5,2017-12-21 13:23:48,Pick from a variety of sounds and layer them to customize your white noise. I really like the versatility and control this app allows for the free version. I enjoy being able to use the equalizer to bring some sounds forward and make others more subtle while using more than one sound. Haven’t experienced any issues or bugs either so 5 stars all the way.,More than expected
5,2017-11-28 02:09:42,"I am EXTREMELY sensitive to sounds when I sleep. Usually if I turn on relaxing music to drown out other noises the music itself wakes me up! Not with this app! I sleep soundly all night. There are all sorts or sounds to pick from and mix and match however you want them. You can play around with it until you get the PERFECT fit for you, not to mention this app is SO WELL DONE. Very fun and pleasing visuals.",Only sleep app that has ever worked for me
5,2017-09-25 11:18:38,"I have had a difficulty sleeping for a long long time. Since I started listening to these sounds my deep sleep is improved each night. I have had some busy days lately and have forgot to listen and my sleep isn't as good as when I am listening. I hope that my sleep time will improve also, but getting a better quality of sleep is a very good start and I am very happy.",Restful sleep
3,2017-09-29 04:05:59,"It’s a pretty good app - if you’re willing to pay like $12 a month for the full range of sounds. I’d be willing to pay 99 cents one time if I could access all the sounds. I don’t even ask for the meditations or lack of ads that comes with the paid service; I just want all the sound options.  Despite the lack of access to a lot of the better sounds, the functionality of the app is great. It works perfect for relaxation, concentration, and falling asleep. If I had all the sounds, I’d give it five stars.",Okay but expensive
5,2017-06-20 16:00:03,Excellent for ambient sounds and music whenever & wherever you want to relax. I've been using this app for weeks and I love the different choices of sounds available.  Helps me fall asleep quickly every night.  I use this app for my noon/lunch quiet time at work and I absolutely love it.  Sometimes use it at night too when I have trouble getting to sleep and it puts me out in minutes.  Love the choices of sounds.,Relax.M
5,2017-06-18 07:36:18,"The layout of the app itself is beautiful, as well as the sounds you can listen to. I've tried many many relaxing sound apps but this one definitely has the widest variety of sounds to listen to in one app, as well as being able to mix them together to create a wonderful ambience. The fact that it also includes guided meditation/relaxation is a huge bonus as well😊",Beautiful App💙
5,2023-09-17 12:05:39,"Absolutely incredible application. So many options for relaxation meditation sleep and help for the mind and body. Ipnos is clearly devoted to providing its customers with the very best in content and its delivery. In love with Aster! Incredible cast of writers and performers. Constantly providing new and interesting content weekly and sometimes even daily. Lifetime or premium subscription is worth every penny,",Incredible app and customer devotion
5,2023-04-03 04:06:18,"I’ve had trouble sleeping for a while and I’ve been using this app for two years I think, it works wonders! I’m able to fall asleep with the noises/sounds provided, and not to mention it’s free!! I like the app bc it’s noises/sounds I grew up around so they calm me down a lot and lure me to sleep.  It’s very helpful and I’ve been able to fall asleep with the assistance of the app despite my insomnia.",Best sleeping app!
5,2023-01-11 06:46:57,Better sleep an app that’s perfect for someone with insomnia or anxiety or even depression. The sounds are soothing any recourse your are you sleep? How long do you snore how long you’re awake when you wake up and when you go to sleep I give it five stars because it’s help me so much in the last month that I’ve used it,Perfect for tracking sleep with soothing sounds & music

4,2022-05-02 14:52:01,"I said in a past review that the sleep recording only worked a few weeks but you just need to plug in your device and it will record you sleeping .But the sleep tracking Is now what doesn’t work and with the sleep recording you have to pay to listen to your sleep recordings but it still shows what happened at night such as farting,talking,noise,I don’t know if it does laughing, and coughing.",It’s pretty good

5,2022-02-21 10:41:46,I use this every night and throughout the day to manage my stress. I have epilepsy and stress is my trigger.

I have tried so many other things to help my brain and my life and nothing is even close. Thank you so much.,Epilepsy approved 🧘🏼‍♀️
5,2021-06-05 07:09:08,It is a great app ypu can access stories but the apps I use let me access one story. But you can access more I recommend star-ship it’s a really good story and my mom says I fall asleep to it and love the way how u can choose your mixes and pick sounds u wanna hear I am in love with this app I use it every night and I’m going to use it right now this is a great app I recommend getting it🎉🤩,I LOVE THIS APP🤩🤩
2,2022-01-08 06:45:15,"Not happy that this app takes over as default audio, even while it’s closed.  Whenever I connect to CarPlay or even just my AirPods, better sleep starts playing even when the app is closed.  I’ve been working with support, but they are running me around in circles and asking me to change settings that don’t seem to exist.  I’ve enjoyed the app features, but will not renew subscription.  Waste of money for an app that shows no interest in improving the user experience.","Good features, but takes over as default audio"
3,2021-10-13 09:17:05,I’m giving this app 3 stars for 3 reasons. Mixing my own sound in nature is great. Definitely helps me sleep. The story telling always has me sleep in about 6-10 mins. The last star goes towards the meditation. The voices are soothing. Gives u different types of directions that helps with concentration so that u are able to meditate. I couldn’t give this app 5 stars because they have sooooo much content but it’s all locked and u have to pay. So I can not fully enjoy.,Could be better
5,2021-05-24 04:30:10,"I got the app because I thought it simply played relaxing music, but was pleasantly surprised to find the user can create his or her own “soundtracks.” It’s perfect considering we all have varied reactions to the same sound. This means I can pick the melodies, sounds, and noises that I find most comforting. Brilliant app for someone searching for what’s most relaxing and soothing for herself or hisself.",Creative and relaxing
5,2021-03-21 04:20:20,"i’ve been using Relax Melodies for two years now. i absolutely adore the “make your own mix” mechanic, it allows for so much individuality. i have multiple different mixes for different kinds of nights. i have never been disappointed by this app and i always sleep comfortably with its help. thank you loads to the developers and its entire team for this wonderful gift to my life.",Extremely Useful and Relaxing
5,2020-06-10 00:11:16,"I LOVE IT! The melodies r actually relaxing and whenever I have trouble falling asleep I turn relax melodies on and I’m asleep in minutes! I can not not keep it on, when I read books I turn it on, when I am stressed I turn it on any way I’m a kid well not a kid I’m 11 and relax melodies is my favorite app on the phone I don’t have the pro version but it is still very good! (I’m listening to it right now!!!)",Relax melodies IS THE BEST!!!
5,2019-07-02 04:40:07,This app is the best!!! I use it every night and it makes me fall asleep in less than 30 seconds! I do the sound river and any meditation I would totally recommend this app especially if you have any trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. I looked to see if I could find any other sleep apps for fun but they all sucked compared to this one! Everyone should have this app and sleep amazingly!!!!!!,Best app created!!
3,2020-05-26 06:13:13,I wanted to take advantage of a “deal” that I saw on the app that would take the ultimate subscription rate to $30 a year so I subscribed and now it’s saying since I only paid $30 I would have to upgrade to get all access. Which was annoying but I decided fine I’ll upgrade. I upgraded and it still won’t give me access to everything. Super annoying so I am looking for a different app to switch to but can’t lie I am used to this app so would love to continue using it!,Cool but the subscription prices are confusing
5,2019-04-29 03:04:15,I have been using this to sleep for about 6 years now. There are so many sounds FOR FREE. Some of them are weird but it means the variety is great and free like come on no app can beat that. Well none that I know of. Typically I’ll fall asleep in about 30 minutes to an hour and if you have anxiety like I do that can mean the difference of sleep or no sleep. I really can’t recommend this enough.,Thank god for this app
5,2018-12-07 05:01:26,"I recently started listing to noise makers in April 2018 to help ease my mind from racing before bed. I’ve tried a few other app but this one is by far my fav. It’s awesome because I can custom make a noise that fits my mood. My husband love ocean noise, as for me I love the sounds of crickets and wood crackling. It’s amazing because I just mix both of our favorite noises and it becomes our own unique bed time remedy. You won’t be disappointed!",Love this App
5,2018-11-17 08:38:10,"Love this app! There are in App purchases if you want to experience all it has to offer, however, the free melodies you have to choose from are great and exactly what I was looking for to help me unwind, relax, and drift off to sleep after a long day. I really like that I have the option to create a profile, customize my melodies, and save my favorite sound mixes to come back to when ever I want from any device!",♥️
4,2018-12-04 07:18:16,"This is a multilayered app that has great features whether you use it for free or you pay for full access. This app offers help with sleeping, meditation and overall wellness.  I haven’t bought the full access package yet since it’s a bit of a steep price, but the more I look into all the stuff it has, it seems like it may be worth it (you can pay a one time fee to get lifetime access). It’s best to wait until they have a sale to buy full access.",Good Wholesome App
4,2018-12-04 06:17:53,I've been using this app for a year now and through all of the updates I have been very satisfied. I've never experienced a lag or problems opening it and my kids love the sounds. When they finally fall asleep I switch it to sleep relaxation mode and it really does the trick. I'm glad I made the purchase. I will upgrade to the unlimited version soon and I'm sure I'll enjoy all the other paid aspects of this app as well. Great product!,Consistently Awesome
5,2018-11-06 13:16:03,I like this app because it is a great way to fall asleep. I like how you can decide which sounds to listen to ranging from the sound of a clock or white noise to beautiful soft piano music. There are plenty of sounds from nature and some forms of music. I even just discovered a really vibration that helps me relax. It definitely feels nice to relax at the end of a long day with sounds that help me sleep and distract from the troubles of life.,Great app
5,2018-11-06 11:39:15,"During a recent app upgrade, all of my previously paid and unlocked sounds reset. Now I have to consider repurchasing them... probably not.  Very frustrating and certainly no way to treat a customer!  Update- the developer suggested I go to profile and click restore purchases.  That worked and all previous purchases came back.  This is a very useful app.",Upgrade lost previous purchase

Otherwise it’s awesome, I love the amount of sounds you can mix. It’s great for when your in a hotel room and you love sleeping with noise (noise that isn’t construction workers) and it’s soothing. This is a good app for if you have anxiety, like sleeping with noise, or just want to mix some sounds for fun. I recommend it.",Awesome
5,2018-10-01 17:13:37,"I use relax melodies if I wake up before my alarm and need to fall back asleep. The variety of sounds makes it so that you can create a blend of sound that suits you perfectly.  I’ve recommended this app to many people.  I also love that you can take it with you when you travel. Say you need the sound of a fan to fall asleep but you have a business trip, you’re in luck here!",Effective and portable
5,2018-09-28 05:04:51,Its weird how well this app has been effective in helping me sleep. Not only is my internal clock all out of wack causing me to have a terrible sleep schedule but my 2 year old is also very energetic. At bed time i just run the app and were knocked out within 20 minutes the most and 10 minutes the minimum. I’m a big fan of the brain waves feature as it is most effective for my personal tastes.,Unique
5,2018-08-11 04:59:35,I used to use a sleeping sounds device I had got from a store but the 4 sounds that were offered were very unclear and not soothing at at all. The sounds on this app are clear even when I turn the volume up and they offer a lot of sounds (even w/o the upgraded purchase). I've been having a great sleep these past couple nights that I've been using the app. Highly recommend!!,Amazing

My favorite it crickets, thunder and rain ☺️you can set a timer or just let it play. I started using some of the new updates like meditation guides. They were nice but -1 because almost all require the paid version of the ap. However I may consider purchasing it in the future.",Perfect for restless sleepers
5,2018-06-10 17:36:56,"I love this app. It's quick and easy to use with a ton of options. I love that you can use individual or overlapping sounds AND that you can adjust the volumes of each one. I use it to help myself relax, for white noise in the car to help my baby fall asleep on road trips, and my toddler loves to experiment with it. I think the pro option of the app would be worth getting rid of the advertisements though.",Very nice app
5,2018-06-08 17:31:23,"I have this app on my iPhone and my iPad Pro. I love it. It was worth the full purchase price. Great diversity of sounds with tremendous ability to mix multiple layers of sound to customize your perfect experience. Excellent use of alarms and sleep timers. I have started using it nightly to go to sleep with ease.   Also great use of NLP guided meditations. They truly work. Even though I need to purchase separately for my computer I will. This is one of the best apps I've used.   Only critique is I would like to hear more natural sounds. A few of the sounds sound synthesized. I would also like to see a toggle control to increase or decrease things like pitch and frequency of rhythms. I.e. More or less thunder, ocean waves, frogs, wind chimes, etc.  Still love this app.","Great, Nearly Perfect"

You will sleep through the night, and if you wake, the sounds will bring you back to sleep.",Consistent and calm
5,2018-05-19 22:51:42,"The wind sound needs a little work. I hear a bell ring that sounds like it out of place. A few of the sounds are of an outstanding quality, but potentially can be a bit longer before they go into a repeat mode. The more frequent repeat tends to distract rather then create a relax atmosphere.  The new update is amazing. The icons look very elegant and appealing. This has turned it into a very modern app. Good job guys.",Interesting sounds
5,2018-05-16 03:23:02,"This app offers a multitude of different sounds that you can mix and match to create the perfect environment for your needs. The pro version offers more customization options, but the standard version already has a great variety, so you don't feel pressured into buying the premium app like you would with some other apps. I would definitely recommend this app as a sleep aid.",Very Soothing.
5,2018-05-04 04:02:31,"I honestly though this app was another generic price of crap, but holy moly was I wrong.  I pulled up the app and selected what I consider to be ‘relaxing’ or ‘soothing’ sounds to drown out my husband watching TV and clanging around in the living room since I had to work the next day.  I have trouble falling asleep on a good night, but before I knew it, I was asleep and drooling on the pillow when my husband came to bed.  Excellent soundscapes!",Puts me to sleep like a baby!

There are ads, but I understand they need to make money somehow and the for the audio it's totally worth it.

5,2017-12-16 15:11:11,"Its ability to change specific components of white noise and its variability are one of the superb characteristics of this app. I absolutely love this app, and I use it especially for focusing during work hours or studying.

5,2017-09-13 03:40:10,"I love using this app when I travel for work, so I don't have the sound machine my husband and I use every night with me. My two favorite features are (1) the app lets you combine more than one type of sound at once (like crashing waves and a melody), and (2) the app has an alarm that increases in volume over custom time periods (30 seconds, 5 minutes, etc) so that you gradually wake up. Great app!",Great for travel
5,2023-09-07 13:07:20,"Ever since I was a baby, I’ve always fallen asleep to the the sound of running water. Whether it’s rain, a rushing river, ocean waves etc… A friend of mine told me about this app a couple years ago. Since then, I have used it every night. I use all different kinds of water sounds and thunder. This is a great app for anyone who needs sound to put them to sleep. I love it!!",Great for sleep
5,2023-08-27 17:31:59,I’ve been using BetterSleep for nearly 10 years every single night. I have tinnitus and I need something playing in the background. This app is the most user friendly and has SO many different sounds that you can combine to make it your custom dream soundtrack. I love it so much! And the meditations put me right out too. Absolutely worth it:),A staple in my sleep routine
5,2023-04-01 05:42:12,I was looking for a white nose app and stumbled upon this one. There are so many options for calming music and soothing sounds that it’s amazing to have such a variety to choose from. I had the best sleep ever the first night and even woke up feeling completely rested! Highly recommend this app if you’re having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep at night!,True to its name
5,2023-03-30 06:41:10,"I love the stories, the sounds, the ability to mix more then one with each other. I love the sounds variety and inclusion of certain frequencies. I sometimes use it when I’m feeling overwhelmed and put it in my headphones to calm myself. Love it! Thank you better sleep.","If I didn’t feel like subscribing to another thing, I’d totally subscribe to better sleep."
5,2022-06-25 14:01:16,"I have had this app since 2015 and it has only gotten better. I use a rain mix to sleep every night.  I just got the premium subscription last year and it’s totally worth it. I absolutely love the stories for the nights when I need a little more help to wind down. I have yet to actually finish a story, I am always asleep before they end.",Best sleep app
5,2022-03-16 06:31:20,"BetterSleep a ton of choices for you to choose, you can go to mix tunes, or hear bed time stories, but the best thing that I found in BetterSleep is that it can also be used for relaxation or to meditation, and another good thing is that you don’t have to pay for everything, there are a bunch of free stuff and can make you have a better time.",Why BetterSleep is the best sleeping app.
5,2022-02-16 02:32:38,"I wish I could afford to subscribe. I’m a therapist and would recommend it to my clients like I do other apps for the same things (meditation, sleep, mindfulness,etc) but I need to try out some of h to e locked features to try some of the other features. But I personally love what I can access and wish I could purchase the full package! I’m sure it would be worth it!",Awesome
5,2022-02-07 07:52:22,I’ve been using this app for years and it’s a great way to get a good night’s sleep. I like the water sounds and my dog likes it as well.  If i turn it off my dog looks and think there is something wrong lol.   The only complaint I have is the new app loading screen is annoying and seems unnecessary and there is not much in-app branding identifying which app it is.,Great app
5,2021-12-13 02:48:27,We have a 6 year old daughter with ADHD. She struggles to fall asleep. She says “I can’t get my brain to stop!”  The first time we turned on a Better Sleep bedtime story for her she fell asleep in 5 minutes Instead of the 1 hour it usually takes her to fall asleep!!!  We are so relieved that we found a solution for our daughters sleep problem & so grateful for this app.,Helped our daughter
5,2021-09-04 11:56:01,Best feature-you can have these sounds accompany your own music if you wish. Fun to play with the sound combinations too. Yearly subscription is kind of expensive but may well be worth it. The free version does quite a lot. Would be nice if Apple Watch app would control volume and more features of full paid version.,Great app for relaxing sounds
4,2021-12-08 09:01:40,I’ve been using this for several months and love it to help me fall asleep. Enjoy the stories. Only reason not a five star is the navigation finding things is a little complicated because there is so much variety. Don’t really have a good suggestion on how to make it better other than. Maybe a history list so I can find what I’ve listened to in the past easier.,Great for helping me relax and sleep
5,2021-06-08 03:17:39,"This works so well, so I just came home from the store and I was so freaking tired I missed my bed so much I couldn’t relax my nerves until I found this app. Many other apps charge and this one does too, but despite that it a verity of meditation sounds and stories don’t cost money! This app is amazing everyone needs this app weather you have tension, stress, tiredness, this app is perfect!! LOVE IIITTT!!",Omg :00
5,2021-04-07 13:12:46,"I love this app, I use meditations or just sounds to relax during the day and during the night I fall asleep to a story. I had some issues with a stories not playing. I found the customer service to be extremely helpful, shout out to customer service representative Jessika. Not only did she send written instructions but visual cues as well. I would highly recommend this app.",Starship and customer service
5,2020-12-22 19:33:30,It’s a great app it helps you fall asleep a little faster than I normally do I fall asleep at about 4am but it helps me with the sounds and the calming voices and it helps calm you down when you are having a bad day or a headache and I personally like that you can make you on sounds so I would mostly recommend this to people that need it.,Try this app for relaxation
5,2020-09-08 15:07:14,"Being able to blend my sounds helps me to create just the right background noise for falling asleep.  If a sound is distracting, I can simply press the sound icon and “poof” the sound is out of the mix.  I couldn’t sleep last night so I put together a little mix with this app.  I had to try a few combinations but once I found the right sounds, I fell asleep within minutes.",Fantastic!!
5,2020-03-11 05:06:04,"I love this app and use it almost every night! I love the additions of the sleep stories, my fave is the space one. Anyway I was having some trouble being locked out of some of the sounds (I paid for the lifetime account a few years back), and the service team responded very soon after I sent off my email and helped me restore my sounds quickly! Thanks again guys!",Thank you!!!
5,2019-11-11 06:07:42,"Before I got this app, I was struggling to sleep. Every night I would stay up until 12:00-1:00 just laying in bed thinking. So one night I decided to look for an app to help me sleep, then I ran across this app! I downloaded it and loved it right away. That night I slept so well! Every night I turn on a sound from the app at around 10:00, and go to sleep in 10 minutes. I highly recommend this app!",Great App!
5,2019-07-28 07:03:34,"This app not only has so many different sounds, but has awesome beats and stuff to help guide your brain and taught me how to meditate a few years ago. Now meditation is a crucial part of my life and honestly this app has and continues to help me reach my full potential. Most worthwhile app I own, and I only love it more and more as it continues to expand. I’d get it now before it gets even better and more expensive.",Favorite App Ever
1,2019-09-14 12:26:45,"I've listened to this app every night for the past 3-4 years maybe even longer. I thought I went to bed last night with it playing and this morning I woke up to silence. Why? Because now they want me to pay $60 a year to listen to it. No warning at all. This app has helped me through anxiety, insomnia and tuning other noises out while I sleep. They used to have some noises you could buy before but could still use others for free - now they’re very greedy and won’t let you listen to any of it. I’m so sad I have to find a new app, wish I never recommend this app to friends and family.",I USED to use it every night
5,2019-01-09 16:37:12,I have so much fun making my own personal sleep mixes. All of the sounds are so soothing. I’ve had the ap for about 3 weeks and have noticed I have less interrupted sleep and sleep deeper than I have in a long time. I love that you can save your own mixes too. Being able to adjust the volume of wash individual sound is the cherry on top of the good night’s rest. Thank you!,Can’t get enough!
4,2019-02-05 04:08:50,I like this app but it’s just like any other sleep app all of the good stuff you have to pay for! Ugh I hate when they do this! I just feel like if you are going to want us to pay for it you should not make it so pricey and a one time payment. I feel like it will just add up to way to much money in the end I’m sorry I’m not paying loads of money to help relax me. 😂                                                -Molly ps this app is better than the others,I like this app..... but
5,2018-11-08 06:00:02,"While there are in app purchases there are still a lot of free options available. I really love the ability to choose a variety of different sounds at once.  It’s so easy to use and I like that I can set a timer and have it both stop the sounds and exit the app. Overall, a great app - I’ve tried others and this is hands down the best one.",Easy to use and lots of options
4,2018-11-16 04:54:55,"I like this app not only because it helps me to sleep, but also because I can use it while meditating. It’s great that so many sounds are available for free, and you can lock your screen without the sound turning off, so I don’t worry about leaving it on throughout the night. Some of the alarm/timer features are a little more difficult to get to work, but once you get the hang of them on your device, they are great too.",Very Helpful
5,2018-10-18 13:39:50,I have been using this app since it was first out and I put it on every phone I have. Yes totally worth the download! You can create your own personal sound like your own relaxation music that appeals to your life and what relaxes you the most! If on a day you can change it and listen to a few different things you don’t have to keep the same stuff every time !,Amazing app and super useful
5,2018-09-23 07:03:30,I started having pretty bad anxiety and a hard time getting to sleep and since using this it’s been much easier I love that there’s a timer so you can set it for 20 mins or however long you want and it turns off on its own which is super nice 10/10 would recommend if you’re having trouble falling asleep or just like background noise/ relaxing noises to soothe you and for comfort,Love it
5,2018-08-14 06:10:52,"I like the different options you have to choose from, pretty varied. The timer option is great and definitely great that you can run this app in background and play other stuff. Like, I can run audiobooks with this app going at same time. Thanks for this. Only way to make it better is probably more sounds, so looking forward to something like that happening!","Great app, use it a lot"
5,2018-07-07 02:21:27,"I have to sleep with white noise... there’s no getting around it! I stumbled across this app while trying to sleep on my morning commuter train. It was perfect for drowning out chatter and other noises. I now use it at home at bedtime and when I am staying overnight at hotels for travel. I like the ability to change the kind of white noise, mix them and adjust the levels for each. It’s great!",My must-have for bed time
5,2018-07-02 07:14:38,"I was skeptical whether random sounds could help me fall & stay asleep but this app is great & actually works! My 4 year old & I BOTH have payed in bed the last 2 nites, selected our sounds, didn’t think it would work, and then were completely sound asleep within a few mins. That’s the honest truth! Thank you for making a great, relaxing app w so many sounds to choose from - and it’s FREE!",Surprisingly great!
5,2018-06-14 04:06:29,"I never really tried sleeping with sounds or meditating to get to bed, but with this app it really just brings a whole new level of peace for me. I feel super relaxed and like the sound options are fantastic. I also like that even after the voice stops, the sounds continue for a nice long time until I wake up. It definitely imo has helped me sleep better and not have interrupted sleep.",Peaceful
5,2018-06-06 03:33:00,I first used this app when I first had my son. I would put my ear buds in and sleep in the hospital every chance I got and these melodies would put me to sleep instantly. I love that you can customize your sounds and mix them together to create the perfect sound machine for you. Another bonus is that you can set a timer so that it won’t play all night long! Highly recommend this app! 💤,Love this app!
5,2018-06-01 09:16:40,"My Step Daughter and Son in Law were using this app on a weekend get together  in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  This helped relax my fifteen month old Grandson while we played cards. I ask about the app, downloaded it and the rest is History.

5,2018-05-30 22:27:51,"Sometimes I just use this at home to lull myself to sleep, but the best time to use it is when I’m in a hotel and I can hear people talking next door, cars revving their engines, ambulances going by. I use about five (of the many) different sounds from the app that have different frequencies/pitches like water rushing, white noise, wind, lullaby, etc. and turn it up and I can go on to sleep without anything disturbing my sleep. Aaaaah!😌",Great app!
4,2018-06-01 01:54:20,"Relax Melodies certainly lives up to its name! This app is very calming and peaceful to listen to, I also love that it has a wide variety of sounds to make your own special melody with. The only thing that makes me rate this four out of five is that you have to pay to unlock about half of the sounds. I recommend this app for anybody who needs music to fall asleep or for meditation purposes. It is also great to listen to on long car trips and during workouts!",Great Calming App
5,2018-05-21 11:52:32,"This is my favorite meditation APP. The flexibility of different sounds, the ability to choose my own combinations and the prepared meditation sound groupings all enhance my experience. The ability to change the timer to any amount of time in minutes and hour Is also an extremely useful feature. Take advantage of the free experience but you can’t go wrong purchasing this one.",Love it!
5,2018-05-14 04:13:06,"I love being able to create my own sound mixes and even save them for later use! I am impressed and very pleased that you can adjust the volume level for each individual sound as you’re making a mix. It really helps to make good combinations. Also, the 7.5 minute sleep meditation option has really calmed my sleep anxiety and helped me to fall asleep. This app is great.",Great sounds and cool meditations
5,2018-05-14 03:13:47,"I love how you customize your personal sounds to make it exactly what u like! I use it to cover up my husband's snoring and when I can't fall asleep.

5,2018-01-08 07:31:16,"I bought 3 sound machine apps to play background sounds while reading, so I didn't get distracted, and so far this one's proved the best of the 3. It gets the job done. But also I was just prompted to review this app positively to have access to sounds I'm like 80% sure I had before? Bit weird but I bought the full version of the app already a while back so I guess that speaks to how much I like it.",It works nicely
5,2017-12-30 12:34:03,I've been an insomniac for years and this has helped me move passed that title. It's the most effective  sound machine app that I've found and I've tried out quite a few. The mediation for relaxation helped me through a bad bout of sleeplessness. I almost gave it 4 stars because there was a period that the app was crashing often on me but the updated version seems to not have that problem.,Great for sleeping
5,2017-12-25 15:51:40,"I use this app a lot for meditation. What I like about this app in particular is the ability to mix different kinds of sounds & adjust the volume of the individual sounds I put into the mix. There are a LOT of choices, which I appreciate because I can constantly tweak my selection to fit my mood.  Some friends of mine also use it for their babies’ bedtimes & it works great for that, too.",Useful meditation

There’s such a wide range of sound choices, the only thing that isn’t soothing is the minute or so I spend puzzling over which combination of sounds to relax to each night.

It's relaxing melodies are at just right tempo which allows me to fall fast asleep.  I've used it for the first time last night, and before I knew it I was in a deep sleep. And the reason why I knew that I slept so deeply was because of the way I felt when I awoke the next morning; I was ready to tackle anything!",Restful sleep
5,2023-11-06 03:57:10,"I’ve had this app for many years, and have seen them develop it. Frankly, it’s only gotten better and it was pretty amazing to start with.

Sometimes when I’m reading a book, I play it in the background and it helps create a more immersive environment.",Fantastic
5,2023-07-21 20:22:13,"I have used this every night for the last year +, on airplanes, in busy crowds to help with anxiety and rest at night.

Even with the free version there’s a lot of different sounds you can pick from. My one complaint is that this doesn’t work with Shortcuts. I would like to make one that starts my mix and starts my sleep timer in the app at the same time. Shortcut support would make this a 5 star app.,Needs Shortcut Support
2,2023-03-18 16:09:56,"There are better sleep trackers out there, tried this one last night and know it took me two hours to fall asleep but it logged that awake time as deep sleep, and didn’t pick up any noise like my coughing etc. I’ve been using a different app for the last year that is much more accurate, tried this one due to ratings and it’s definitely not worth it.  Does have cool features like sounds and stories and the alarm works fine if you’re not looking for a sleep tracker.","Not useful as a sleep tracker, cool other features"

4,2022-09-09 09:10:59,Iv been struggling for YEARS with insomnia and other issues and this app really does relax me. If I I am restless all I have to do is open this app and play at least three soothing sounds and I’ll be fast asleep within a matter of 30 minutes to an hour. Yes there are in app purchases but you don’t have to buy anything the basic sleep sounds have helped me more than any other sleep aid app,Better sleep has helped SO MUCH
2,2022-07-28 11:12:59,First let me say I was unlikely to keep this app after the free trial because I really hate subscriptions. So I would have to truly love it in order to pay 60 bucks a year to use it. That didn’t happen. The first night it played music for a while and I guess I fell asleep fast which was good. I woke up the next morning and could listen to the recordings and it tracked my sleep. The results of that looked about the same as my Fitbit so I thought that was pretty good.  The second night nothing. No data. Not cool.,Did not track my sleep
5,2022-03-20 18:29:00,I have been using this app on and off for years and I promise you it works. The best sounds and I love how you can create your own mix.

Huge fan obviously. Yay for this thing!",Love it and have been using it for years

5,2020-03-10 04:29:49,Really like this app.  Recently I was having difficulty sleeping and it  helped me relax enough to fall asleep. I love all of the different rain choices (I particularly like “City Rain”).  Being able to combine sounds and music is a fun option and all of the different categories from which to chose makes this app one of the best. You can’t go wrong downloading this one.,Great App
1,2020-09-26 04:11:55,"Do not expect competent customer support to come with a subscription to this app.  Simple functions that are easy to use with OTHER apps, such as syncing, turn into a nightmare of back-and-forth incompetent guesswork by customer “support” agents that are basically clueless and useless when the app fails to work correctly. Material and set preferences get deleted, syncing fails, silent pauses in the sounds/music every 8 seconds, you cannot listen to sleep-inducing sounds if the alarm function is already turned on, etc.  You will have to delete and reload the app frequently to get things to work.

2,2020-09-11 02:01:57,"Many people can not afford $60 per year in one lump sum. One lump sum of $60 is also the only option for subscription which puts off a lot of would be subscribers, like myself. Paying a monthly subscription fee is a lot more feasible for most. There should be options for monthly and yearly subscriptions... like most subscriber based apps.

I was charged for this after the pandemic started. One of these reps actually pointed out that they didn’t want the app to be a point of stress, but also actually said that due to the “terms of service” for iTunes, that “their hands are tied” and would not be able to refund me, after purchasing a lifetime membership already. I already contacted iTunes before even receiving a support message about this and they were in full agreement. You just don’t do this to customers.",Bad customer service

I use this app often, especially when I travel, as it helps block out noises to help me sleep more soundly.

My brain just wouldn’t stop when I tried to go to sleep. Being able to create my own comforting sounds made all the difference- my mix is heavy on waves, lapping water and white noise. I’ve suggested the app to anyone that mentions trouble sleeping.",Helped Me
5,2019-05-29 02:32:07,"This app helped me through some of the worst anxiety I had in my life. I was having reoccurring nightmares, and every night I would work myself up into a fear of having the same nightmare over and over again, that it would happen. The calming meditations and selection of sounds helped me stop fearing bedtime and see it as a calm and peaceful time of freeing the mind of all things stressful and scary. Thank you!!",Sleep Anxiety

1,2019-02-17 02:30:17,"I remember I bought this app several years ago with one flat rate during a discount special (I think it was a couple of dollars to unlock all the sounds, and to remove those pesky ads). I especially loved the ancestral sound and would mix it with the other (now pro) sounds.   I rediscovered and redownloaded this app after I found that I was having a hard time sleeping due to my busy nursing schedule.   To my shock it seems that almost all the sounds I used to mix with were under a ""pro"" subscription. I find it totally unacceptable, especially after being such an early supporter and paying for access to those sounds years prior.   I'm not exactly sure when the jump happened from a one time purchase to a subscription, but I'm not happy.   I was hoping I would get grandfathered in, but I don't think that will ever happen with how app developers after starting to do subscription based apps nowadays.",Pro subscription seems like a money grab
5,2018-12-15 17:40:17,I’ve been using this app for about six or seven years now every night when I lie down to go to sleep. I was one of those people that had to have absolute silence in order to fall asleep before I started this app. It has helped me to sleep so soundly and when I wake up at night I fall back to sleep very quickly because of the relaxing sounds that are in the room. I absolutely love it!,So helpful
5,2018-11-14 06:54:52,"I have used this app every night in my bedroom for many years. I have owned sound machines in the past, but nothing sounds as real and soothing as this. You don’t hear repetitive cycles, just seamless, relaxing sounds. I travel a lot, so it really helps me in hotels and airplanes too. Just today I used it to drown out the sounds of noisy children in a plane so I could get some much needed rest.",Can’t sleep without this!

5,2018-10-12 14:47:15,I used to have a lot of trouble falling asleep and this app has been very helpful in resolving that. I like the fact that I can customize it to suit me and my preferences. The ability to save and share my settings is also good. I recommend you spend a little time with different sounds and mix levels. You will have it failed in to your taste and you will become a believer too.,I love this app
5,2018-09-14 14:28:19,I’m a foster parent and I have a 3 week old baby just released from the hospital due to drug exposure and addiction. He’s very irritable and it takes a while to calm him. This app has been a huge help in getting him relaxed. There are tons of sound choices you can mix and play at the same time. I play soft peaceful music with ocean waves in the background and it calms him almost immediately. I highly recommend this app.,Baby loves it!!

2,2018-09-01 04:05:55,"I loved this app, my review would be 5 Star, but one of the updated took away the volume controls. I can adjust each sound, but there is no master volume. The volume controls on iPhone control the ringer until there is music playing, so there is no way to turn down the sound before turning a melody on, which means when I need help falling asleep in the middle of the night and turn on the app, it comes on full volume and wakes up my spouse. Hopefully the master volume control comes back, it’s not unusable, but it makes me cringe every time I turn it on.",Was great...

The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I don’t think that people should have to pay for sounds, but, I understand why we do. Although I do think the full vip pack is overpriced, the sounds that you get are nice. You do get a third of the sounds for free, and they are enough. Best sound app out there.",Amazing!

Each child has saved their relaxation melody favorites and is able to quickly access them without having to pick a new combo each night.",A staple in our house for years
5,2018-05-29 03:53:44,"I like how customizable it is. You can select several different sounds at once, and manipulate the individual volumes. I was thrilled when I found the sleep timer for this.  One thing that could be added is a list of sounds that are active and volume sliders for each so you don't have to scroll through the pages to turn up rain on roof and turn down frogs",Precise
4,2018-06-19 08:09:52,"I finally found the perfect sound machine!  This app has every soothing sound you need, as well as want!  This is by far the best in this category.  I lived in the countryside as a child, and now the city as an adult, and this app has the sounds of both!  I can reminisce my childhood with the night outdoor sounds of crickets, trains and mild traffic, or I can have the soothing ocean waves lull me to sleep.  Whatever sound you desire, you'll find in this perfect app!",Every soothing sound you need
5,2018-05-28 03:40:46,For the past couple years (since having and traveling with kids) we’ve always used this app for white noise at hotels to soothe the little ones and cut out hallway noise. Now we use it even when traveling solo on business for the latter reason. In the past few months we’ve been using it at home instead of our fan—it’s the soundtrack of sleep now!,Perfect for travel
5,2018-04-26 17:05:31,"I have been extremely pleased with the quality and variety of sounds and melodies from this app. I originally purchased the app for our baby to listen to to put her to sleep, however I found myself using the app while on the train or in the office and found it very nice. Even the continual updates pump out wonderful tunes consistent with the high quality of the original melodies.",Superb sounds!
5,2018-04-04 07:14:00,"I just found this app while browsing through the store and after trying it was pleasantly surprised to find it helped me get to sleep! I’m a night owl so it’s hard for me to get to sleep at a regular time. When I tried using this app I fell into slumber within a few minutes! Best sleep I’ve had in days, I’ll be recommending it to anyone I know that has problems sleeping at night.",Best sleep I’ve had
5,2018-01-18 04:40:12,"Last night I forgot to put the timer on the Relax Melodies app so it played all night. I slept so deep and felt so rested. I was kind of nervous to ask my husband if the music bothered him. When I went to say ""good morning"" he looked at me and said ""I slept so hard last night. I actually stayed in bed the entire night."" I was so happy to hear that he had the same response. I can't wait to fall asleep tonight!",Sleep Improvement
5,2017-11-24 23:11:56,"I always sleep with a fan on at home. Went on a road-trip awhile back and did not have access to a fan!!! It was suggested to me that there were apps you can get that supply different ambient sounds. So I looked and found this one, connected to my Bluetooth speaker it made for an amazing nights sleep...so good I almost forgot it wasn’t a fan. 😂 I would 100% recommend!!!! Thanks for helping me sleep😴💤",Great!!!
3,2018-01-11 03:23:03,"Great app, have used for years.  Hello developer! I am not sure how to respond so I hope this reaches you. The thing that I would change about the app and why I gave it only 3 stars is that I can see all the cool stuff I could have if I just paid more. But I can’t justify the cost so I just keep having to scroll through all the cool things. And it’s a little off putting. It would be nice if I could sample the sounds to know if I really would like them or use them and then I’d be able to rethink a larger purchase",Not too shabby
5,2017-10-18 01:24:44,"I started using a fan over the summer because it was too hot. Pretty soon it got to the point where I got used to having the fan every night. Not only because of the breeze, but because of the sound it made. It's starting to get too cold outside to use a fan, so I searched for an app that would give me the same sounds. I like this app the best out of all the ones I've tried.",Helpful
4,2017-11-01 02:07:18,It diffidently has the most sounds I’ve ever seen on a sleep app. Love the choices! Amazing app.   But I just can’t do a monthly payment or $20 flat. Too much. Maybe if you could also sell each individual sound at a lower price people can pick what they want to buy... $20 is a big number to purchase an app for. I mean leave it as an option but for us who maybe just want one sound extra give us a choice to do so,Love the sounds and variety
5,2017-08-09 19:35:59,"There's a great selection of sounds and melodies to choose from. You can choose a single sound or create your own with a combination of sounds and melodies. I like that there are free ""top favorites"" to choose from and you can create your own and add it to your favorites. I use this at work when I need to tune everything out for stress reasons and also at night when I'm laying down to sleep.",Love it!

A big thank you for its creator and for giving us a large amount of downloadable content for free without bombarding us with 🍪 cookies, and harassing advertisements. This app is solid and a more than great starter to usable content on a daily basis ! Thank you / Grazie Mille!!",Thank you 😴
5,2023-05-06 12:49:04,I was trying to fall asleep last night at midnight and couldn’t. I realized that I need noise to fall asleep. I downloaded the app “calm” but I needed a membership to get almost everything. The next best choice was this. I would give it a billion stars if I could. I recommend you get it. The noise is so relaxing and I love how you can make your own sound!,Best App for sleep Ever
5,2023-04-02 19:28:05,"I just downloaded this to help for a nap.  I loved the choices and then noticed the cost.  Too high for my budget but after choosing and listening, I had to have it!  Sleep and relaxation are not easy for me and this looks like a very positive app for what I need. I have just begun to learn how to use it and it already helped with a much needed nap today.   Thank you for this!",Wow
5,2023-03-31 04:31:36,"I sleep with my app on every night. I made up my own night time sounds for different things I need to go to sleep. I sleep with a fan every night too and my app. But when I go somewhere I can’t always bring a fan or one isn’t there, but I still can use my app and fall asleep Instantly. Can’t live without it. Recommend to anyone",Best sleep
5,2023-03-13 00:18:38,I have anxiety which makes it hard for me to fall asleep. I’ve been using this for months and I think there’s only been twice that I didn’t  fall asleep before the end of my meditation. I love how you can keep the background sound mix throughout your meditation and keep it playing even after the meditation is over,Love it
5,2022-10-16 05:41:46,"When I first downloaded the app it was outstanding, but it started crashing every time I tried to open it.  Tried deleting it and getting it again and turning my phone off and on, but nothing.  Would happily try it again if it works, but as of now I’m left disappointed.",Great App but Started Crashing When I Opened It
4,2023-01-20 05:47:36,This app is one of the best. Before I got this app I had tried like 5 different ones and you either had to pay to use it or there would be no sounds you could use. When I got this one that were so many different choices that you didn’t have to pay which I appreciate. There are so many great things about this app and I would definitely recommend it.,I love this app
5,2022-10-07 07:04:28,Using the app has truly helped me to calm down after a long day which is normally between 12 to 16 hours depending on my coaching and work schedule. The app has relay helped to bring me to a place of calm and relaxation were I can drift off to sleep very comfortably. Also stay asleep longer and I seem to be sleeping more sound as well,Really able to relax
5,2022-09-05 05:43:36,Signing up and by passing the paid subscription is a bit frustrating but once I got through to enjoy the free version to try out I was really pleasantly surprised.  I’ve only been using this app 4 days and I look forward to trying new things on here. I love the sleep and meditation recordings. Considering paying for the subscription.,Pleasantly Surprised
5,2022-08-12 00:33:47,"I love this app and used it daily until my membership recently expired. The price almost doubled since last year! So the message clearly is that if you can’t or feel it’s irresponsible to spend $40 on an app, you don’t deserve to use their app to relax since almost all their content requires a membership. Disappointing.",Love this app but now it’s pricey
5,2022-03-10 04:10:31,Update: stellar customer service when I had a problem with anew phone. I've enjoyed this app for years and I'm impressed with updates and expansions over time. It really is soothing and versatile. I love the meditations. Great for home and also great for travel. Drown out road or airplane noise. My kids ask for “quiet music with the lady talkin” at night.,I use it daily. Premium is so worth it!
5,2021-10-23 07:03:31,been having this app for about 2 years now and never had any problems had many sounds to choose from and many other things to make ur own mixes also has mixes already made yes some of them are locked but there’s many free options to chose from like i said. i’m going to loyal to this app for sure GET IT,i love it
2,2022-02-25 06:50:49,"I have been using this app for years, probably since it first launched. I have told everyone I know about this app. I have loved it and used it every single night for as long as I can remember now. BUT ever since it changed from Relax Melodies to Better Sleep, it’s gone completely down hill. It logged me out of my account and then all my saved mixes are GONE. I had an annual subscription that no longer works. I get so frustrated when I have to create a new mix every month when all I want to do is sleep.",USED to be good

At night I had a very hard time falling to sleep; one night I decided to look for an app and I hit the jackpot !!!! It takes me very little to fall to sleep and the annoying ringing in my ears ""goes away"" once I start the app. I would like to extend my most sincere thanks to the developers!!!!!",Best sleep ever !!!!
5,2021-09-27 04:09:30,In use this app every single night and have been since January. I suffer from tinnitus and nature sounds are the best way to drown out the ringing.

I am so used to dud- sleep apps, that don't have good quality sound or relaxing music; however, once I downloaded this app I immediately fell in love with it. I've never got a better nights sleep after downloading this app… I cannot say thank the developers enough! Great job! Now on my way back to sleep 🛏",Amazing
5,2018-11-13 04:01:42,I just downloaded this app a couple days ago but so far it works well. I like the ability to mix different sounds together. I don’t think the fan sounds as much like a fan as I would like (which is the main sound I wanted from this app) but overall I am pleased with the functionality and variety of options. I would recommend it.,Very functional app!
5,2018-10-08 10:59:35,I got this app before I was pregnant as a way to relax before bed. Now that I have a baby I use it even more. The ability to combine soothing music with different sounds makes for a different experience every time. It works so well for naps and to block out sounds when staying in new places. We both fall asleep quicker as we are able to relax easier.,Great for babies and adults
5,2018-09-22 07:20:44,I love this app. I have not found any problems with the app except that there are sounds that I really want that right now I can not pay for. The free sounds rang from missing the big city to missing living in the woods. There is a sound for almost everyone to find that helps relax you. P. S. If you love cats you can fall asleep to the sound of a purring cat if you’re away from your kitties.,Best I’ve used
5,2018-09-15 12:32:33,Great app that allows you to sleep and choose and customize your own sounds even if you want to change up the sounds the next day air please have for you even when the app is not showing on the screen it’s still plays in the background which is really good and relaxing especially at night time when you want to fall asleep!,Relaxing
5,2018-08-12 22:02:39,I have had this app for about 5 minutes now and I am absolutely blown away. I love that I can do as many or as little noises as I want. I love that I can fall asleep to the sound of the ocean with optional crickets in the background. I also love that I can use the melodies for yoga and meditation in the morning. I can already tell this is going to help so much with my self-care and fitness journey. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE CREATOR!!!!,Best app I have EVER downloaded
5,2018-08-10 15:12:06,"Not only is all the sounds incredibly soothing and provides an easier route to escapism, but the overall ability to choose your own combination of relaxation through audio, as well provide some simple meditation audio, is utterly amazing. This works wonders for helping me meditate and sleep more. If you haven’t already downloaded this app~ DO SO! You won’t be disappointed!😇💓💯🧘🏻‍♀️🙏🏻",This saved me🤩
5,2018-08-07 06:41:23,Honestly have tried a lot of other free sleep apps with sounds but this one is the most user friendly and the most customizable. Love how you can set every level of sound individually with the sliders! I’m from Ohio originally and now I live in CA where there’s never any rain. I love falling asleep to the rain sounds and the thunder with the crickets and again love how you can adjust it specifically! Great app. 5 stars!,Awesome App
5,2018-08-01 07:35:32,"I've been meditating for a while now and I began with pure silence. But once I introduced sounds to my meditations, it completely changed how well I explore my mind and this app has some of the best sounds that I've discovered in the App Store. Highly recommended for meditation but also I use it to have background noise to sleep. I've gotten some of the best night sleep lately just by using this app.",Best Meditation Sounds
5,2018-07-12 06:33:31,"I’ve had this app for years and it never fails me! I have a very nice machine at home so when I travel I used to suffer through a night of silence OR settle for some crappy hotel machine.

With so many options, you can’t go wrong.",Awesome sound machine!
4,2018-07-16 22:35:54,"This app is helpful in quieting your mind, especially before bed. I’ve never really had a hard time falling asleep, but my husband does and the app is his go-to for disconnecting. The timer is a convenient feature, which all relaxation apps doesn’t seem to have. The app could be improved if it allowed users to preview the sounds for the pro version to know if they are sounds that work for each individual.",Relaxing and convenient
5,2018-07-06 04:02:47,"I've been using this app for years. It's incredible. I have tinnitus so for me not having to take a homeopathic alarm clock with me when I travel is wonderful. I plug in my charging chord and play the sound I personally like to fall asleep too nightly. Sure, they offered 2 free sounds that I won't even use to write a review but I should have written this years ago. Thank you so much for this app. It's truly awesome!!!",Awesome
5,2018-06-25 04:28:01,"This app is really just about perfect!  I'm sure there is always something that could be added or tweaked but I really can't think of what it would be in this case, unless you need to fall asleep to a sound that no one else would desire. It's pretty much all here and you can customize it how you like, with different sounds and different volumes simultaneously. It's just great!",Whatever You Want
5,2018-06-13 09:22:44,"Way easy to use, the lifetime upgrade is definitely worth the money. the extra sounds and detailed easy to follow meditations work and there’s so many, to give variety and tranquillity.

Less than a month after making the purchase all of the meditations except for two were removed and now I have to upgrade/pay more to access the meditations I used to have access to. This is really disappointing and feels like a rip off. I would recommend that you don’t pay any extra for this app, just use the free version & don’t waste your money.",Disappointed
5,2018-06-08 10:02:44,"It is great! I fall asleep to a calming, peaceful storm every night. I know that some wouldn't find the sounds of a rain storm soothing but I do. And I love that I can change the volume of each sound individually. That way it is exactly how I want it. I can even set a timer so the sounds stay until I fall asleep and then they shut off on their own. It is a great ap and I'm very happy to have discovered it.",Love it!!!
5,2018-06-08 03:43:12,This is by far the best relaxation app I have found! I was working 3rd while in search of help. I had taken herbs and supplements that only made me feel groggy and pillow spray while great wasn't quiet cutting it alone. The melodies available really help you to clear your mind and let it all go. I love that I can set the app to stop playing in an hour so it doesn't run down my phone and that it has alarms to gently wake me up.,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
5,2018-05-25 03:17:43,"This app is amazing! I've been using it for a few years now. I've always had a hard time getting to sleep, but with this in the background I'm able to relax and sleep sooner. A lot of noise machines that can be purchased in store don't allow you to make your own compilation of sounds, whereas this does and you can even determine how loud you want each sound. It's amazing!",Love it!
5,2018-05-24 04:48:12,"I sometimes need background noise to fall asleep: the hum of the a/c unit, the fan, rain. This app was perfect for what I required. It delivers a variety of sounds and you can mix and match them to create your own melody. The app also utilizes individual volume control for each audio. While creating your blend of sounds, any one sound can be as loud or as faint as you need.",A wonderful app for relaxing and sleep.
5,2018-05-15 06:55:53,"I used to sleep through anything... then I became a mother (15 years ago). Now I wake at every little sound. Well, not anymore! I love this app!  I love that I can mix my own sounds, including adjusting individual volumes for just the right blend for me.

5,2017-11-12 11:17:43,I’ve tried several different white noise apps and this one is my favorite by far. I have a white noise machine plugged in next to my bed that I have used for years but can’t take traveling. Not only has this app saved me away from home but I’ve started to use it even at home because of the soothing variety of sounds. I’ve not had any glitches or issues. Thumbs up!,Relax Melodies is great!

I don’t like to charge my phone overnight, and am a restless sleeper so would rather have this app running all night like I used to (would only experience 10 - 15% discharge before updating to iOS11).

Which is saying something, because I rarely pay for anything.",Best sleep app ever!
5,2017-06-13 01:52:10,"This app is the best sound app. If you need background noise for awhile it stays on; whereas other apps only play for 30 minutes or an hour. Additionally you can create your own perfect sounds. That can include music, just sounds, chants. The combinations are endless. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to cover up other sounds when sleeping or just in need of some background noise.",Amazing

3,2023-08-13 18:31:21,I have a problem with my sinuses that makes sleeping all night difficult. I generally wake up after 3 or 4 hours because I can’t breathe. After an hour or so it usually clears up enough for me to go back to sleep. This app doesn’t recognize the break in my total sleep time and only evaluates the first sleep period and not the remainder.  It doesn’t evaluate the second sleep time at all.  So I’m not going to pay $60 for sleep sounds.,"Interesting, but flawed"
2,2023-07-28 12:34:30,"The alarm works most of the time, but for an alarm, that’s not good enough. I always have a backup set just in case.

1,2022-11-17 02:23:22,"You’re better off recording a sound yourself, looping it in audacity, and playing the file directly. For free, mind you. Because bettersleep absolutely broke homeplay support several months ago. You can’t play meditations and your sleep sounds at the same time. The app will default to sending voice alone to a home pod.   This is such an easy fix, I was expecting them to fix this any moment now for the last 6 months, and instead, what they’ve done is put an inescapable meditation trailer on their home page.  Sorry if you wanted to use airplay for anything but the same 30 second talking clip. Because bettersleep doesn’t support that anymore. They use to have shortcut support, now? That’s gone too. If this goes on, soon bettersleep won’t even have sleep sounds at all, it will just be a worse version of the million other meditation apps on here.  -1/10.","Broke airplay, then made it worse."

I have chronic insomnia, so I was actually very surprised and pleased with the overall experience. The night time 10hz is the best.

5,2022-08-16 20:19:48,I love this app I love Rain Sounds apps and this is the best one I didn’t care that I had to pay a little bit of money for it because you can customize your own sounds and they have so many options to choose from and it’s really easy to use the app it’s not difficult or challenging to use like some other ones,Love
5,2022-07-17 15:28:57,It helps me sleep much better but there is one thing I wish to change. The fact the when you first download the app it only gives you one story and you'll have to $40 per year to get the full experience. To me 40 per year is okay u just wish that it at least came with more stories.,This app is awesome
5,2021-08-11 08:21:15,I love this app. You can pick out your own sounds and make your own mixes. I used it all the time to help me sleep and to relax. However I wish I could just pay more for the lifetime subscription instead of paying every year. Overall it is a great app the I can’t recommend enough to my friends and family.,Great sounds
3,2022-03-20 09:59:12,I usedto B use this appBecause it went allow me to make my own choices now I have to pay subscription in order to make my own sleep sounds.I do not like the new update and the fact that no one has seen my review.   Watch advertising videos that are not too long. Too unlock sounds every so often so we can have our sounds. That are locked. A bunch are locked that weren’t before. Like the weather and non weather. Please?,Used to be amazing
3,2022-01-15 03:37:47,I was looking for a quick and easy sleep tool. I’ll give it another day or two to see if I can figure it out but don’t feel I should have to work at it this hard. I’m upgrading my review from one star to three because app support reached out to me to offer tools and help to make using the app easier. But I still have to work harder than I wanted to learn the app. Others may pick up on it quicker. This is just my personal experience.,Confused
5,2021-06-12 03:33:40,This app is the best!!! So many good options and ways to mix sounds. I love the meditations and the music tracks. The stories are fun too.  I just like how they break out the sounds and how you can adjust the level for each one and save the mix. I sleep sooooo much better with this app. I can’t go a night without it !,One of my all time favorites
5,2021-03-21 12:13:13,"I really like this app and feel very grateful to have found it. Aster’s voice is so soothing and it’s really helped me create healthier sleep patterns. I use it to fall asleep and it helps me fall back asleep if I wake in the night. I’d love to see more morning meditations added. There are only 3 or 4 aj’s I cycled through them quickly. I’d like to wake up and reach for this practice as well. All in all, very worth it for me.",So helpful!!
5,2021-02-14 18:46:18,"This is 110% the BEST app for meditation&sleep currently on the AppStore. I love the fact that you can mix so many different sounds to make the right melodies for your needs, and they always harmonize perfectly. hOwEvEr, I do feel that there are WAYYYYYY too many features are locked. If you just added more free things, this app would be 👌👌👌. Thanks for reading my review!","AMAZING app, too many locked features."
5,2020-12-03 06:19:38,"I love this app so much. When I can’t sleep I always turn this on. The 15 minute body scan is my go to comfort meditation at night. It puts me to sleep when I’m struggling! I actually thought they had gotten rid of it and almost freaked out, but it was luckily still there! Plus I’ve used a variety of sounds to remind me of home when I was living abroad and trying to fall asleep. So nice!",I love this app!
5,2020-05-21 06:21:29,"Normaly I’ll listen to podcasts or game grumps compilations, but for some reason that hasn’t been helping with my insomnia recently. This app tho, it does wonders. Though a lot of the sounds are locked, there are quite a few that are for free. And your ability to change the volume or layer multiple sounds, it’s a great thing to play in the background and let your mind drift off.",Really awesome
5,2019-01-25 03:42:04,"I really like this app. I like to use it as background noise when I'm home alone or reading. I also use it in my office at school. The kids really like to pick what sound plays in the background. My only complaint is that some of the sounds are ""locked"" unless you pay for them or use points that you earn by using the app for a certain amount of hours.",Great app
5,2018-10-29 16:16:18,This app helps me with sleeping and my anxiety. I love all the different sounds it comes with and it's so nice to have it on in the background when I'm working or just need some noise to fill the space! It's a lovely app. *update* After two years I am still using this app! It's honestly been so much help to my stress and anxiety and I don't know what I'd do without it. Worth buying the premium package. ❤️,Love this app so much
5,2018-09-30 22:51:51,"This app is my go to for relaxation and falling asleep as soon as possible, I love it so much. I really hope it never changes, at least for the negative. I love the fact that it’s so useful and it’s free, I don’t mind ads as long as the developers get paid, so I really don’t have a complaint about this app. I came for the two free sounds, and I stayed because I just love this app so much, haha. Keep up the great work!",Amazing
5,2018-09-29 04:14:41,A few years ago I began to practice mindfulness/meditation as a way to cope with some pretty heavy stressors and would scan through ENDLESS apps looking for something to aid the process. Fortunately I came across “RM” and have been HOOKED ever since! I recommend it to everyone and what’s great is their free version is actually functional and actually free! Use in a regular basis and wouldn’t be without it!!! Thanks,Have loved since day one!!!!!
5,2018-09-07 02:42:46,This app is pretty cool and actually works. Also...that’s really all I have to say because if I write a review then I get two free sounds which is purrrty awesome so yeah. I mean I meant what I said in the beginning sooooooo yeah this app is pretty great and I suggest it for people who like to chill or who want to chill or for people who sleep. Anyway enjoy this app while I enjoy my two free sounds I get for rating this app! (Its a win-win!)🤗🤗🤗,Everything is a-otay
5,2018-09-07 00:55:09,I love this app. The format is so clean!!! It helps me fall asleep very easily. I would download to see all the features. The good thing is you don't have to get up to stop the sounds. There is and timer and when the timer end it will stop the sounds and exit the app. The only thing I would like them to do is not have to pay to be a pro member to get all the sounds and meditation lessons.,Best App!!!!!!
5,2018-08-22 19:23:06,"This app is amazing for meditation, it has a variety of different sounds that you can play. You can make your own sound by combining individual ones and you do not have to restart them once they are over which is great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes so background noise while trying to relax, medita, sleep or even while they work.",Great for meditation
5,2018-07-25 02:30:30,"I’ve had this app for years now. Anytime I’m stressed or just restless, I put this on to my pre-set sounds and drift right to sleep.

I even use it for my young son when we travel and he needs some help sleeping. You can’t go wrong with this!",It works!

Now that she’s almost four, we use it on evenings when we are having trouble getting to sleep or when we are in unfamiliar places (like vacation). I’m a light sleeper myself, so I like it too. The sounds are easy to navigate and are actually soothing, unlike some other apps we have tried.",Life saver
5,2018-07-11 08:15:48,"I had tried lots of apps, and none have got as much sounds as this app does... It has a lot of great options like a timer, mix your own sounds, which I love, alarm, and so many more.  I have not paid for anything which is the best part.  When I'm having hard time sleeping I turn to this app.  Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do. I simply love Relax Melodies app!",This app is the best one out there
5,2018-07-08 05:39:52,"This allowed me to customize my listening experience, I’m not someone who can listen to random things and fall asleep easily, this keeps the same songs/sounds on repeat like one long continuous song. The timers and reminders make it really easy to use and it works for me. 10/10, I tell my friends and family about it every chance I get.",Can’t sleep without it
5,2018-07-05 05:26:25,"No matter where I go, I no longer have to pack a big and bulky fan when I am going to a hotel or elsewhere.

5,2018-07-03 00:46:53,"Ever since my second pregnancy I've suffered worse with my insomnia. This app helped me to get to sleep and still does. Not to mention my children now fall asleep to the storm settings, too. :-) My favorite sounds are the thunder and thunderstorm. My husband thinks the rain sounds like sizzling bacon, but to me it's an effective white noise when combined with the thunder. Never fails to knock me out when I put it on. Thanks!",Effective

5,2018-05-21 05:54:44,I have been using this app for the last year and simply love the variety of sound that are provided. We have a baby in the room next to ours and we play various sounds from the app so noises in the house do not disturb her when sleeping. There is a huge collection of sounds which are all high quality. Small price to pay for a quality product that we use daily!,Awesome App!
5,2018-04-28 12:05:50,"I love this app!  I use it every night to sleep.  It is especially helpful if I am in a stressful period and I wake up in the middle of the night.  Without it, I find that I stay awake and think about things, but with it, I usually fall right back to sleep.  I used it to help sooth my new puppy when he came home.  It is best for my meditation, though.  It helps me relax and focus. I real breakthrough in my practice!",So many uses
1,2018-05-03 10:43:10,"I’ve been using this app (which I PAID FOR) for quite a while now. It has high-quality sounds and was easy to use. I never used the meditation tracks. The “major update” they just dropped did not mention that they have gone to a ridiculously high-priced subscription model. Ten bucks for a MONTH?!? And $50 for “lifetime access”?!? I paid for this app when I got it before, so who’s to say that $50 access actually means anything. Now my previously-purchased sounds are LOCKED until I pay for them AGAIN, PLUS there are now ADS on the bottom. I’m VERY disappointed and will be looking for a different app.",They ruined it
5,2018-01-07 06:25:14,Has been so helpful to have with our baby. The fact that you can exit the app and it still runs so baby has calming sounds while you browse your phone. Timers are also great as they don’t run your battery out. Nice selection of free sounds as well. One of the best apps I’ve used in quite some time. A staple on my phone and anyone else looking for calming sleep.,Very Nice - A must with a baby.
5,2017-11-20 12:07:44,"I love this!! I've been under so much stress lately, I've never had issues falling asleep before but lately its taken me hours. I've created this very relaxing atmosphere and routine but the silence at night was deafening...I tried music apps but the adds interrupted my sleep! This has allowed me to fill the silence with relaxing sounds and without the add interruption. I haven't slept this well in a long time!",Exactly what I needed
5,2017-11-09 10:28:18,I love the ability to create my own ‘relax mixes’ and even fine tune the volume for each sound I add. It’s also very easy to use in the way you can choose your melodies from the labeled tiles hanging like wind chimes  You can also combine your mix or any sound with any of their meditations. Great job on making this! First app I’ve used daily.  Very well thought out!,I NEVER pay for apps...until now!
5,2017-08-10 08:26:45,"This is pretty good! Randomization of sounds would be nice, as well as a better way to adjust individual volume (to adjust a sound you have to touch it, which turns it off, so you need to touch it twice for the slider to appear and the sound be on).  These are super minor things though, as this app is better than all the others I've tried, by far.",Good one. 🙂
5,2017-07-17 06:21:35,"After having trouble sleeping for years, I stumbled into this app. I am addicted to it!!

4,2023-05-05 02:48:57,"Okay so it’s a good app, but the main reason I downloaded this app when watching the add was because you could see how you sounded when you snored or sleep tslked. But when I got into the app, you have to pay to get that, that’s the only thing that makes me mad. I just wish that part of the app would be free, it would make me enjoy it more. Although it is cool to see what phase of sleep you were in.",It’s good
4,2023-02-22 03:02:31,I love better sleep! It helps for chill sounds and playlists while sleeping. The only problem I have is the prices. A good 3 quarters of all the sounds are locked. If your gonna lock most the sounds I recommend you make a five second recording of the sound to see what is like then you can buy the membership if you like the sounds you are hearing! Overall a really good app! 🙂,Great app! Pricey 😐

2,2021-07-16 00:58:42,Just note and beware that if you download the app and pay for a subscription - be sure to read fine print of the policy and regulations.  It specifically states they will not give you a refund if you cancel your subscription if you are not satisfied.  No matter how much you paid. Weekly monthly or yearly.    So make note of that. I think for an app like this - refunds should be considered at least on the yearly or lifetime subscriptions if a customer becomes disappointed or dissatisfied with the product.,Refunds should be provided

Years ago I paid for the “full access” before there WAS a subscription, which said I was purchasing full access to the entire app.   But when they switched to subscription-based a few years ago, I got NOTHING—like I had just the free version again. I refused to buy a subscription bc I’d already PAID for the full version and shouldn’t have to pay more for something I already bought! Don’t care that the business model changed—you HONOR what you sell your customers!  Now tonight I see an update occurred and of the 2 free meditations, one has now been removed—the one my five year old LOVED.

I believe those that had originally paid for the full app before the idea of a monthly subscription was implemented should be grandfathered in and still allowed their full access. Kinda bs in my honest opinion.,Hmmmm....
5,2018-10-07 07:07:41,"I paid for a year membership, was just like $20 or something. I’ve got huge sleeping issues and a mix I’ve made has really been nice, there are a lot of fantastic sounds here and the freedom you get to change the volume of each sound in the mix and the amount of sounds to work with is phenomenal. Haven’t had any problems with this app, love it.",Surprisingly good
5,2018-10-04 11:57:37,"I have found this app to be very helpful in guiding me into a good night’s sleep. There are many sounds to choose from, with most of them free. I love the ability to create a  mix from multiple sounds. It lets me personalize what works best for me. I also love the exercises that ease me into relaxation and sleep. I had not slept for months but have now had 4 straight nights of good sleep. I love this app!",Very helpful app
5,2018-09-27 08:34:44,"Most apps like this have a trial period/ few sounds to choose from. Not this one. Has probably 30-40 options for free...for forever! You can pay a bit more to experiment with other soothing sounds, but there’s no pressure or pop-ups. The paid sounds are just displayed at the end of the list for you to look at if interested. Beautiful layout as well.",Lots for free- No trial
5,2018-08-19 05:49:26,"This app has been great in helping me reach states of calm and relaxation, and over time and the repeated use of certain sounds, leading me to fall asleep more quickly. There are a lot of options - from storms to wood whistles to rolling ocean waves - and the ability to mix them together is rather good. There are also guided meditations to help you sleep, though I haven’t fully utilized those yet.",Really helpful for relaxing
5,2018-08-17 01:09:45,"I have really have had a better sleep because of this. I haven’t been able to sleep with school and homework so this app has really helped in many ways, it helps me stay calm when I’m scared or nervous. It helps me relax and not to be stressed all the time. And I’m ONLY 10!

5,2018-08-07 05:30:33,I have truly enjoyed this app. The ability to play the sounds and melodies you find more relaxing is wonderful. The best part of it is that it’s free. I have yet to pay for the extra features on the app. But the free version gives you so many options. I highly recommend this app to anybody who is looking for sleep sound and meditation exercises.,Wonderful App for Meditation and Sleep Sounds
5,2018-06-25 03:38:56,"I had the free version but recently upgraded to pro. I have appreciated using this app and love the extra sounds. It is great for blocking out room sounds, for a sleep aid, for relaxation, balance and harmony as well as focus and concentration. I like that you have the ability to change the volume level on each independent sound and that you can save your favorite mixes. Thankful for this app.",Great app..!!
4,2018-07-05 11:14:59,"The variety of the sounds are great for all sorts of situations, but some of the sounds get very repetitive, and in some cases really annoying after a few minutes of having the same 5-10 seconds of repetition, like ringtones with a obvious cut off. It would be great if there are variations (or small and subtle random 'sparkles') within an individual sound that changes every few minutes.","Good variety, but sounds are repetitive"
1,2018-06-27 07:00:24,"DO NOT BUY - their billing structure is a scam!!! A few months ago I wrote a glowing review of this app - it had really truly changed my life by helping me overcome insomnia. The reason I now give it one star is that while I paid $19 in January for “lifetime access to all features,” tonight I opened the app to find that all of the meditations and even some of my own original sleep mixes are no longer accessible - the app now wants me to pay $1.67 a month! I am so disappointed and will never buy anything from these developers ever again. RelaxMeditation is also by the same people - do not support their sham products!",Helps me sleep but billing is a SCAM
5,2018-06-13 03:09:44,Love this app! So many choices and combinations to try. Love that you can save favorites. Love that you can still go to other apps and programs while this continues to run. Sleep comes much sooner and more relaxed. Don’t understand why it sometimes turns itself off during the night. Would love to have the clock numbers large enough to read. Still a great app.,Total relaxation
5,2018-06-11 05:44:17,"I have tinnitus and I use this app for sleep.  The sound of running water and rain is especially soothing for me, much better than a regular white noise machine.

I use the sound function to relax during the day too.",Awesome app for sleep and tinnitus

One feature that I absolutely adore is the fact that you can play the app's sounds even behind your music/ videos that are already playing on the phone. Don't think I'll be deleting this app any time soon!",Pretty awesome!
5,2018-06-05 17:32:33,I struggle with insomnia at times and this app has been incredible! You’re able to select the sounds you want at the volume you like which is a huge plus when many times the preset melodies on other apps may not be exactly what you’re looking for. I also am very happy there’s a timer so I can set it to turn off after I’ve fallen asleep.,Best app for relaxing sounds!

5,2018-02-22 13:03:47,"I turn this app on at night for some white noise.  The white noise usually lulls me back to sleep incase I wake up halfway through the night.  Without a fan, or other white noise source, my mind usually starts ruminating and won’t relax enough to fall back asleep.  This app is a life saver for me!  I have used this app since my iPhone 4 days, and it is still a go-to for me.  Thank  you so much for this great free app.",Helps me sleep

5,2017-12-02 10:37:56,This is the best app! Our family has been using it for years. I am a lite sleeper so have a consistent background noise helps me stay asleep.

It is such a fantastic app. I do wish that the meditation ones were free but I get they need to make money somehow so I’m not complaining!,Use this to sleep every night!
5,2017-10-12 01:15:11,"I love the variety of sounds and that you can create your favorite combinations and save them. Other white noise apps I’ve used don’t let you play the sounds in the background so if you exit the app to use other parts of your phone, it shuts off. Not this one! I primarily use this when I’m studying and to get my 1 month old settled down and relaxed in the evening. Works like a charm!",I love it!

My son is almost 4 now and we STILL use this app at bed time. We change up the sounds from time to time and we all find them very relaxing. I use it to fall asleep as well some nights! Best sound app I've found!,Fantastic!
5,2017-08-20 09:46:17,"I love this app so much, it helps me knock out in less than 5 minutes. The sounds are realistic in terms of how you would naturally hear them. All of the sounds are very soothing, I sometimes use them to study. There's a timer that automatically turns sounds off and leaves the app to prevent battery drainage. I do have the premium version but the free version was amazing as well.",Perfect sleeping app!

5,2023-04-04 11:24:09,I was able to drift off to sleep after just a few moments of listening to this wonderful app. White noise helps with my tinnitus because it helps cancel out the sound I hear in my “ears” and help mask it so it doesn’t seem so loud. I can’t wait to try another sound hopefully one that will help keep me asleep more often.,Drift off to sleep

5,2022-04-17 02:40:45,This app is really unique in that you can layer multiple sounds over each other- you can create your own personal zen of any combination from a huge library of sound options- the story feature is unique as well! Even if you don’t upgrade there is plenty included to help put you to sleep.,Try it!
4,2022-05-02 04:30:03,Only downside is that you have to pay for everything but I guess that’s how business works but they would get a lot more downloads if they let you see like half of the stuff that you can’t see.

I am a light sleeper and sometimes it becomes difficult to stay asleep if there are surrounding noises. I sleep with these sounds turned on because they are consistent and lullaby me to sleep. I love this app! Not just for sleep, but for anytime during the day or night.",Favorite Sound
5,2018-08-19 15:59:31,I have a busy work life with three major projects going on at the same time. It's so easy to get wrapped up with work from the moment I wake to the time my head hits the pillow at night. I've set aside time each day to just calm my mind with Relax Melodies playing in the background. It works wonders and I find myself looking forward to this every day! Thanks for helping me unwind!,Calms a busy mind
5,2018-07-26 08:51:12,"The number of sounds available to mix, save and share is amazing, even with the free version!  It works with pets too - my cat always sleeps best with some background sounds in the room, and this app gives me quite a selection to mix together for his rest.  Even a dog that I had to sit for was calmed and comforted using the selection of sounds in this app.  I highly recommend it!",Good vibrations...
5,2018-06-20 02:34:42,"This app has had two great uses. I used it first for myself for relaxing/meditating. The other is using it for my daughter as it has white noise and an oscillating fan (which prevent me from getting a dry mouth by saying 'sssh' for a prolonged period). There a large number of sounds you can get for free, and I can't wait to try some of the meditations and binaural audios with headphones. Thank you!",Great for relaxing and soothing babies
5,2018-06-13 17:52:56,"I use this app for everything.  Primarily to drown out the snores from my housemate, but it’s also been useful at work.  I am in one of those open floor plan offices where we’re all talking over each other. Having a variety of soothing sounds helps drown out the buzz. Somehow it’s become one of my most used apps. It does drain the battery somehow, but otherwise it’s perfect.",Versatile relaxation app
5,2018-06-01 05:26:51,"I was so happy to find this app. I have a hard time falling asleep and this wonderful app is just perfect. Thanks for creating it.    I would wish however that the Tibetan bowls would be more varied and the sounds going  down the scale would be more relaxing than going up. You replay the same three sounds over and over. It should be varied, don't you think?",Relaxing melodies

I like how I can mix up different sounds together that’s super cool to me ... this app helps with stress sleepless nights ... it’s very mind calming & relaxation...

4,2018-05-31 16:03:24,"With a lot of variety! Love the sounds and variations, i use it almost every night. The ONLY reason it’s not 5 stars is because some navigation around the app isn’t quite as intuitive as I think it should be. For example, it’s nice that you can’t control the volume of each sound, but in order to readjust it you have to i select it, reselect it, then rush to reach the volume option. Little things like that.",Great and Helpful
5,2018-05-26 04:12:04,"I was taking sleeping pills to help me sleep. Not wanting to be stuck taking sleeping pills to be able to sleep for the rest of my life, I thought I’d try this. It is a true miracle for me. I was waking every 2-3 hours if I was able to get to sleep. My mind was just going all the time.

4,2018-05-19 20:51:44,"I like using this app, whether it be for relaxation at bedtime or just for soothing sounds during the day. It's easy to choose the desired sounds, because I can just tap on the buttons and the pictures are pretty clear. I also like the alarm feature that allows me to listen while falling asleep, and will go off after a desired amount of time. That way, I don't have the app running all night.",Great app; easy to use
5,2018-04-25 10:10:43,I can always find sounds that will soothe me to sleep and the variety of sounds are amazing. I recommend this app to anyone who can’t stand people who snore to drown them out and to people who have a hard time sleeping . I also live right on a highway and am all the time hearing sirens and loud vehicles so it’s nice that this will drown the noise out and help me fall asleep somewhat faster than I normally would.,Get this app!
5,2018-03-28 14:15:25,"I downloaded this app when a friend of mine recommended it. I have trouble sleeping without some type of noise going on, and surprisingly this app was all I'd hoped for and more.

Though they are a bit pricey I can't complain simply because this app is so wonderful to me.",Amazingly Soothing.
5,2018-03-26 06:56:50,"I came across this app a few years ago after my nephew was born and it was a life-saver with the sleep routine. Then I found myself using it (while convincing others as well) to go to bed or even just to relax and block off life’s everyday stressors. I like that you can customize a playlist, set a sleep timer or an alarm amongst other features. Good way to tap into your zen :-)",Awesomely Relaxing :-)
5,2018-02-28 13:56:20,"I thought I could only fall asleep to the sound of a fan that was actually in my room, and I didn’t really use this app until a couple of nights ago when I just felt like I could not sleep because my body was so active and awake for some reason. So I tried this seriously and I was amazed at how relaxed I became. I also love it has Hz options!",Never thought I’d actually use this!
5,2018-01-24 07:09:26,"I have struggled with insomnia for a while. I found myself needing to take a sleeping pill to get a restful night of sleep.

The ability to easily choose, blend, and control each sound individually allows me to fine tune my sleep sounds. It’s also really hard to identify distinct patterns with the rain options. This allows my brain to relax and really focus on sleep. I’m a river, heavy rain, wind guy. The melodies are great for relaxing. Great user interface. Very intuitive.",Best out of three!
5,2017-10-02 04:22:57,"There are quite a few choices in this app and I sometimes use it when studying but it definitely helps me fall asleep.

Helps me sleep
3,2017-11-11 06:50:05,"I've had this app for a very long time and even though it's still pretty good, it used to be even better. There used to be so many more meditations that came with the free version. Now you only get a few and the number goes down to two after a while. I would so much rather look at banner ads than pay for something I could use for free not that long ago. Still useful for those that travel and can't sleep in a quiet room, just not the best.",Used to be better
5,2017-09-29 03:02:38,I love the reminder feature you can set for bedtime.  Sometimes I don't realize how late it is.  I also love the quality and the variety of the sounds as well as the fact that I can keep it going all night.  Visually it's nice too and I love the sounds of the alerts you can choose when it's time for your wake up alarm to sound.  Great app!,Wonderful sounds & easy to use
5,2017-09-26 17:28:44,"I've had this app for YEARS and it's perfect for everything from something to listen to when you study or something to drown out noise when you sleep.

I've never had any types of problem with this app.",Totally worth it
5,2017-09-21 00:03:43,"I have recently developed tinnitus, and have to use the app to sleep as well as for work to help drown out the high-pitched drill sound in my right ear.

Couldn't function well without it!!!!!",Sanity saver!!!
5,2017-08-09 07:06:11,Title explains everything! Must try 💕💕 I also did this to unlock two sounds. Sorry I'm a sellout. Lots of choices and you can create your own tunes. Like 40% of it is locked though so you have to pay to unlock it but it's understandable. In short it's a good app and I don't think there's any ads that pop up besides the occasional self promotion. White noise really helps me sleep when my roommate is talking.,I LOVE THIS APP
5,2017-08-09 03:42:24,"Me and my 1 and a half year old daughter love this app. It takes all but 5 minutes to put her to sleep with the calming music and the ocean in the background.

5,2023-02-20 23:45:23,Dogs barking. Loud parties. Car alarms. I was about to end it all (or move) when I found this app. I love the variety of sounds available. I was looking for just “white noise” and then I accidentally added “traffic” to it which created the perfect blend for me. Now it doesn’t matter what’s going outside because I’m feeling peachy with this app. Thanks!  ❤️,I ❤️❤️❤️ this app
5,2022-11-28 04:18:49,"I’ve only used the free version the app about a handle of times thus far, but each time I have fallen asleep wayyy faster than normal and stayed asleep ALL night which is NOT typical for me by any means.

Only one we listen to!!",We love this app. Have for years and years
4,2022-09-24 07:26:30,"I used to rely on another app with about 6 sounds and it would just not do the job. I'd find it very hard to fall asleep until I found this app. There are so many wonderful mixes you can create with it and some are just so beautiful and smooth that it will put you right to sleep. I do recommend using some sort of headphones, though, because the app sounds clearer.",A Very Great App!
5,2022-07-14 19:03:20,"Calm, and otter sleep apps you get nothing and can’t use anything without premium, the app you have a lot of stuff.

5,2022-07-04 08:10:47,I love that you can customize your preferred white noise. Distant thunder sure. Soft rain? Ok. Campfire? Add it to the list.

5,2021-09-15 01:12:48,"This has helped me so much I have already seen a difference. I also love how there’s still tons of sounds even if you don’t get a subscription.

5,2021-06-08 01:02:54,It definitely depends on the narrator (because certain types of voices I can stand but some are awesome) but the only way I can hear the ending of a sleep story is by sitting during the day to specifically listen for it. Otherwise I’m usually asleep less than 10 minutes in. Awesome stories and my favorite narrators are awesome.,Works wonders for my sleep
1,2021-07-15 18:33:06,I tried the free trial.  Didn’t want to continue.  Deleted the app.  Then it pulled money from my account anyway and I can’t find contact information to get this resolved.  I’m sure the app is great for many people but it shouldn’t be so hard to cancel when it is not a fit for you.  I would appreciate someone contacting me and getting a refund.  It’s been almost a year.  Unused.  But I don’t have the time to figure out how to fix this.  Please.  I’d appreciate a refund and please make it easier for people to cancel.  Customer service would be a good idea.,Impossible to cancel
5,2021-04-20 06:45:00,"I use this to help fall asleep on some nights. I like the ability to add or take out sounds to make my own custom sleep sounds.

5,2020-06-21 03:42:48,"OK, this is my second attempt to leave feedback. This is a great app! I never needed ""white noise"" to fall asleep; however, a friend told me about this cool app. I decided to try it out with my ""Bose speaker"" and it works amazingly.  It probably doesn't sound too well with the speaker on your phone, but with headphones, or a nice Bluetooth speaker, you will be amazed at the flexibility and the choices you have, even with the free version. You can choose from so many different sounds and layer them at whatever volume levels you want each to be. It creates such a wonderful sleep environment, I think it is ideal for even the worst insomniac.  Kudos to the developers. Thanks for bringing such a cool app to the market.",I'm addicted
5,2020-06-03 04:59:49,Downloaded with some skepticism but ended up sleeping quite well! Living in apartment means that sometimes I’ll hear murmuring sounds from neighbors conversations or music playing. It can make falling asleep difficult at times. This app helps to drown out those sounds while calming me down to fall asleep. I think the yearly fee is worth it. Doing a trial right now and planning to keep it.,Helpful
5,2019-10-07 22:13:43,I work over nights and have trouble sleeping during the day. I tried at app for about a month then purchased the premium. Well worth it.

Many options and always updating. ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP!,Great App
5,2019-01-23 05:50:58,"I have been using this for about two weeks now and it is spectacular! I made a mix of sounds that i haven’t changed and now whenever i hear it, i go to sleep easily.

I love this app so much. thank you!",Never slept so well
1,2019-07-31 04:16:23,"I would not recommend this app, because almost all of the sounds are premium, and they want you to pay sixty dollars a year and six dollars a month! Nobody wants to have to pay, but until they fix that and have all of the sounds, stories, etc, for free, I will not be using not supporting this app, or recommending this in the future. If someone ever reads this who works for the app or made the app, try to either make most of them free (THEY CANT JUST BE THE SCRAPPY BAD SOUNDS THAT WERE LEFT OVER), or all of the things on that app for free!","Most of the sounds you have to pay for!

5,2018-10-12 06:20:09,So Ive used this app regularly for a while. I like the ability to mix sounds to create a rainy night ambiance to fall asleep to or just use white nose like a busy cafe mix to study and get work done too. There’s always the abilities to upgrade and get fancier more specific sounds. I like the sleep timer feature and alarm. Way better than an over priced sound machine.,Worth it

It has an easy to use interface that can be as simple or complex as you wish to make it.   My favorite feature is the sleep timer.  Being able to fall asleep with a mixture of relaxing sounds and white noise is exactly what I need. The fact that it will turn off in however many minutes I set on the sleep timer is perfect!

4,2018-08-03 05:08:56,I love making my own mixes and the reminders to go to bed. This app puts me in the zone to sleep and actually keeps me from looking at technology that keeps me awake because I’m so content listening to the sounds.

The amount of options are great too!,We use it every night

One suggestion- make changing the volume on individual sounds easier to access. It seems to only appear for a few seconds when you first click on it. It'd be nice to access it later so you can fine tune.",Favorite relaxation app
5,2017-11-12 03:47:10,"There are so many sounds that are available for free, some are optional to pay for. I am enjoying the free version of the app. There are plenty of free sound options and choices for mixing sounds, with volume control for each sound. I especially like being able to use the timer shut off for free. The sounds are truly relaxing.",Even free options are nice
5,2017-06-24 10:10:11,I've checked out many sleep apps that I end up deleting after trying for a couple nights. This is the first one that offers a self made mixture of sounds and melodies that truly get you to sleep soundly. There is also an option for meditation that helps you relax before sleep. I love this app and whole heartedly recommend it to all you insomniacs out there.,Best Sleep Sound App
5,2017-06-22 04:42:45,It helps me go to sleep every night it has ocean sound it can do piano sounds you can even create your own melody with this app it helps me relax and forget about all my problems with this app I am calm with this app I am me I can't believe this is better than miraculous ladybug and cat Noir nothing's better then miraculous!!! This app has to be my absolute favorite,This app is Better than Miraculous Ladybug & Cat Noir!!!!
5,2017-06-13 12:08:06,"Looove this app. Great for hotels, camping, and when you're sleeping somewhere that's too quiet. You can save your favorite ""sounds"" meaning a mix of different noises like a fan, rain, waves, crickets, etc. There's also a timer so you don't drain your battery and a million other options I've never even explored. I've tried several ""fan apps"" and this is by far #1.",Love the Customization and Variety
5,2023-08-17 13:31:38,Absolutely love this app! I have been using it since it was “Relax Melodies” and can’t imagine a night without using it. I really love that you can create your own sleepy time melody using all the sound sample options that are available. I always recommend this to anyone who has a hard time sleeping.,I’ve Been Using This App For Years!
2,2023-09-29 11:53:19,"I bought this app a long time ago. Years before subscriptions services were en vogue. Now they want me to keep paying more and more and more to use a product I already paid for. Yes, I understand there are updates. That’s nothing new. I paid for a product that came with updates. If I were to buy an app w a subscription today, I would expect to pay for the subscription. But when I buy an app outright, I do NOT appreciate the bait and switch. I will NEVER convert to the subscription.",Subscription😡
5,2023-08-06 12:43:11,"This app is magic! It has made my sleep long and restful! I can’t imagine being without it! Perfect sounds and rhythms for everyone.

5,2023-07-21 17:04:53,This is the best sleep helping app I’ve ever installed I fell asleep faster with a song I made on the app and you can name it to it helped me fall asleep in less than 5 minutes I usually take around 15 minutes to go to sleep and it’s just life changing if the developers see this thank you for making this app it’s just awesome,This is great
5,2023-07-21 13:55:32,"This app works. I appreciate being able to bring certain sounds to the forefront and others in the background, more subtle. I like the multiple layers, a real symphony. I use it for reading and background sound around our home. It’s worth every penny. Even our hyper vigilant Mini Pin pups are relaxed when it’s playing.",Calming
5,2023-07-21 03:44:44,This app is amassing I use it every night . Before I started using it I had a hard time falling asleep now it is so easy . Paying the fee for the other features is a worth it you pay one and get access to all the other features. I am always exited when they add new story’s to listen to.   — vary happy user,It is an amassing app
5,2023-04-07 12:38:36,"I can’t recommend this app enough.  I’ve used it for more than a decade and it helps me everyday.  If I feel a panic attack or anything too stressful there is a solution in here for it.  The Covid meditation is my favorite daytime meditation but I use them all.    And when I need to fall asleep, I don’t need medication anymore.",I can’t recommend this app enough.
5,2023-03-03 23:54:36,Really like the soothing sounds — very relaxing after a long day. Just throw on your wireless headphone headband and drift off to sleep.  Lots of sounds and music to choose from if you pay for the subscription — which I did because I love my options.  Love that you can add a timer.  I use this app almost every night.,Enjoying this app
5,2023-01-24 03:45:27,"Other than the limited options without a subscription, I honestly don’t see anything wrong with this app. It’s only been a week since I started using it and I can’t say I can sleep without it anymore. The menu can be a tad confusing at first, but ends up being easy to navigate fairly quickly.",wow
2,2023-02-07 13:10:32,"I have always enjoyed this app…until all the unnecessary changes. Every time I update it, I lose a feature I like. First it was sleep tracking issues. Originally I was able to track my sleep while listening to my selection of sounds through the night. Now after three hours, the sounds stop…which actually wakes me up.  Now with this latest update, I can’t play my audible books simultaneously with my sounds. I always set my audio book for 30 mins and keep my better sleep sounds playing through the night. The work around used to be just have an alarm set…now that no longer works.  I will be canceling my premium subscription and looking for another app to meet my needs.   Shame because this one had everything I needed, once upon a time",Too many unnecessary changes.

But besides my one problem prolly not apps fault it’s awesome,Very nice one issu
5,2022-12-17 11:23:09,"Saying I love this app is an understatement. I believe it can’t be matched when used at its full potential (subscription), but I’ve been subscribed for just about 3 years now!

5,2022-11-19 23:28:58,I’ve always had sleep issues and tried a lot of different pills that just stopped working after sometime. I decided to try it out and past 2 night I fell asleep fast and hard.

4,2022-07-28 04:32:26,"Basic sounds and tunes to fall asleep to, would like more options for free. Especially ones that sound more natural, for some of them you can tell it’s a pattern that repeats every few seconds. Overall has a basic variety and gets you to fall asleep.

Relaxation, stories, music; anything you could need to fully unwind and start a new day, or continue the one you’re in after relieving the stress. I couldn’t do without the stories. They make me sleep through chronic pain. If there was a gold medal for apps, this one would be deserving.",An awesome app!
4,2021-11-06 15:35:13,I use this almost exclusively for bedtime. Big fan of the lucid and other dreams meditations. A surprise benefit for me was the sound breathing exercises - would really love to see more functionality built into that: the ability to control the length of breaths/holds and to choose which sounds are played. Philips Hue and/or Sleep Cycle integration would be a lot of work but would also be great additions.,Really nice variety
4,2021-10-16 04:22:09,"This app has a very creative collection of stories and meditations. My favorites are the yoga nidra, the Scottish Broonie and the story of Fae. The Scottish women’s voices are so comforting and soothing that I could snuggle into bed and feel ready for sleep very soon after listening. It would be awesome to have a playlist for these stories and others like it. I also enjoyed the Middle East tales and playlist of Sinbad and Ali baba.  Thank you for the sleep assist!",Good story collection
5,2021-05-23 03:34:42,"Loving it, used this when it was just a free version. Upgraded to the pro to start sculpting the way I sleep, read, study, and meditate.

Keep up the great work and thank you for the good nights sleep!!",This app keeps getting better <3
4,2021-06-28 04:50:56,This is a great and amazing app and it helps me fall asleep almost every night and blocks out any noise I don’t want to hear. But almost everything is locked and anytime I want to listen to a meditation er story I have to worry about it being locked and I don’t want to have to pay for the premium. So I think they should make some more things free so we can have more options.,Great app! but….
5,2020-12-18 07:03:57,"If you’re a person who needs ambient noise to fall asleep, this app has an excellent array of sounds to choose from and the binaural sounds addition honestly seems to help a lot.

If you are reading this I really recommend this app I have noticed that when I use the bedtime story I don’t wake up once in the whole night! This app is also very good for meditating. My kids uses the meditation before tests they love it it also helps focus on work or whatever you may be doing. So you should get this app. LOVE ITTTTTT!,GREAT APP LOVE IT

3,2019-11-05 13:38:14,Been using this for years and love it but now with the new timer to close the app feature instead of a set time in the morning it’s not performing right. The sounds abruptly shut off and random times throughout the night and it wakes me up so i have to go and turn it back on and reset the timer for a shorter time so it doesn’t disrupt my alarm in the morning. Bring back the set time. The timer is very inconvenient.,Loved this app for years but most recently I’m upset with it
5,2018-09-18 15:38:04,"When I travel, I find it hard to shut out all the new sounds around me through the night. The sounds on this app are perfect for drowning out unwelcome noises. There is such a large variety to choose from, you're bound to find one you like. I have many favorites so I can change them out each night and even combine sounds. I love this app for sweet sleep!",Sweet dreams!
5,2018-09-10 01:44:44,I initially downloaded this app to add some white noise to our bedroom to help block out the street noises.  Our dog barks at every sound she hears and this app did a great job of keeping her quiet all night.  It came in super handy on a long vacation where we stayed at several B&B’s with thin walls.  My husband loves the background noise and I love customizing the sounds.  We rarely agree on stuff like this but this app is a winner!,Fantastic!
5,2018-09-06 03:57:42,I’ve been using this app for about 2 years and I make my sound mix and play it every night and it helps me relax and fall asleep. Prior to using this app it took me over 2 hours to fall asleep and I would not stay asleep through the night. Not sure how but this app changed my sleep so much and i love it. I sleep so well because of it :),"Perfect, use it every night"
5,2018-08-13 02:39:12,I’ve been using this app now for almost a year and it’s been one of the best additions to my nightly routine. Especially if I can’t seem to shut my brain down from a busy day in my classroom. I love the ability to create my own mixes and also having preset ones as well. The thirty minute timer that closes the app has always worked to help me fall peacefully asleep.,Helps Me Relax

I bought mine years ago and was rewarded by not being able to migrate my purchase to my next iPhone. When I repeatedly reached out to customer service I was ignored.  I now see that another user with the same issue got a response after writing a bad review and was told to speak with customer  service. Well, I tried reaching out to CS first and was ignored, so now I have to tell everyone that in my experience, this developer cares less about our wellness and more about our wallets.",My one time purchase was a lie.
5,2018-08-07 05:13:29,"I’m so so so happy I found this app! After hitting the spa, I was determined to find an app that can play soothing ambient music. I was shocked to find this app had so much more than I bargained for. If you’re missing home, and you lived in a city, it has city ambient nose (without the sirens, thank goodness 🙄). Oh, and it wakes you up to the sound of roosters. It reminded me of waking up in my home country of Ecuador. Keep working your magic!🙏🏼",Love it!
5,2018-07-20 05:33:50,My boyfriend can’t sleep without a white noise which I personally can’t handle but once he downloaded this app our nights turn from hell and nightmares to a peaceful night.   I also like meditate and sometimes is hard to fin te right sounds that makes me focus or that help me in the practice and with this app is easy to find the perfect combination for what I need to work.   Great choice!,The best choice
5,2018-07-20 03:34:55,I have been using this app for a few years now. Has great sounds. Love how you can make your own mix and even name it. They have added so many new sounds and meditations. There’s volume control for each sound and a timer so your phone doesn’t run the app all night long. User friendly and full of options. Recommended to all my friends.,Great app!
5,2018-07-18 14:58:47,"Allows you to fully customize the sounds from a broad menu of options, even in free mode. Nothing else like it.

It can be a different experience each time.  Never gets boring.",Best in class app
5,2018-07-09 05:46:54,This is the best free app I have found for so many sounds to help me. I’m am a veteran and sometimes have sleep issues. This helps tremendously. What's so cool about it is that you can choose multiple sounds at once and kind of create your own perfect world. I like the timer on it too. I can tell how long it takes to fall asleep if I’m still awake when it shuts off. I rarely am.,Life saver
5,2018-07-07 01:03:02,We were on a vacation and did not have a fan with us. I found this app and we were able to sleep comfortably every night thanks to this fantastic app. Love trying all the new sounds as well!! Best app for sounds.

If I had the choice I would always use this one because it has way more options and the rain sound quality is better too! Get it!,Love it!
5,2018-06-06 03:12:48,I have trouble with clearing my mind at night which causes issues with falling asleep but since I started using this app I have been able to fall asleep within a few minutes!

Couldn't believe that when I went to a biofeedback session the Doctor had the exact same app for her clients!,Honestly love this app!
5,2018-05-12 12:28:32,I have always gotten a better nights sleep when it’s raining outside or sleeping near an ocean or having soft music playing . With this app I can mix all 3 together and that makes for a wonderful nights sleep. When I’m stressed during the day I take a deep breath mix other sounds and it helps me feel calm and relaxed quickly. So happy I was recommended by a friend to download this app.,So helpful!!

5,2017-12-21 08:54:19,I have so many of these sleep/meditation apps but this is truly by far the best one. So many ways to customize and enjoy the sounds it produces.

The first time I opened it, I was surprised by the wide variety of sounds to choose from for your mixes. I fiddled with it for a few minutes, and when I looked up, my baby was asleep in her swing! I would say it's pretty effective.",Great variety
5,2017-12-04 06:47:09,"I use this app every night for myself and for my kids when we travel. The sounds are realistic and don’t have any repeating patterns that stick out to me unless I’m really listening. I like that you can mix sounds together, change their volumes independently, and pause them so when you’re ready to use it again all you have to do is hit play.",Great white noise!

I've used the binural beats with rain when reading in a room with lots of distractions &, of course, the sounds for sleeping. It works great! I do wish a few more of the sleep/relaxing binaural beats and isochronic tones came with the free app version.",Perfect sleep aid!

5,2017-07-28 00:46:42,"I love everything the free app version has to offer, no bugs in sight and there's still a wide range of options. However, I would be more enticed to buy the full version if they allowed a 1 day trial of it, so we know what we're getting.

The alarm overrides the sounds in the morning so you can still wake up.  I have recommended it to friends who have a hard time falling asleep. All have had positive things to say.,Great app
5,2023-09-19 14:30:22,I used the sounds to sleep better and it 100% worked for me!

If I’m having extra difficulty going to sleep or relaxing the stories and meditations are very helpful. I love the sleep tracker and how I keep my sounds playing throughout the night. This is the best app I’ve found for sleep sounds!,Absolutely love!
5,2023-08-03 07:50:00,I usually sleep with a fan on and prefer complete silence but my kids and pets would stay up all night waking me up at odd hours talking or playing video games.

2,2022-11-26 07:31:31,"This app crashes almost every 2 weeks after an update…I would prefer to buy the premium features but again, why should I pay for something that doesn’t work consistently? Plus there is no IT support on weekends so that’s also an issue. For what they are charging, it would be nice to have some IT staff on call for when the app decides to crash and burn.

If that is the end goal of a social movement (That trans people are as bland and uninteresting as the rest of us) that is cool and all— but not in a sleep app. The profiteers of the app should just keep making the app BETTER FOR SLEEP and donate their money to social causes— instead of making a social justice sleep app that does nothing but keep people awake and wondering ….,"Good app got expensive, worse and preachy"

I can only apply promos to purchases thru the web version. Very frustrating, when I want to keep all my purchases thru the App Store only.

Given that I use the app to prepare to sleep, the annoyance is not welcome - like an advert before an ASMR video, hence the lower star rating.   I hope this review encourages the app to adjust the near-constant and annoying popup about reviews. If your user declines more than ten times after they enter the app, don’t you think it’s likely that they don’t want to post a review?

5,2021-01-22 05:28:22,"Best free app to play your own custom rain mix, we add thunder and clock sounds which put us to sleep in a few minutes each and every night. You can even add guided meditations at the beginning and when they are done, your custom mix plays all night. Couldn’t recommend it more for continuous rain mixes. The options are limitless!",Best app to play all night
5,2020-01-18 15:13:39,"I have trouble staying asleep, so I was looking for an app that would help. This is an amazing app. You can layer different sounds to create your own melodies. It also has a timer so that it stops playing after a certain amount of time. I am happy with the basic sounds without the subscription. I definitely recommend getting this app.",Love this app
1,2020-11-24 04:44:05,I have been using this for years its the only way i can sleep . I had to delete the app and redownload and i find all the sounds are blocked . I will continue to use the app as it the only way i can sleep but this incredibly greedy and frankly disgusting behavior.i found this app in middle school and im about to graduate hs . The app id basically useless now as almost all content is blocked theres like 6 sounds not blocked . This is absolutely disgusting behavior so to anyone thinking of getting the app : DONT . It used to be great but this is worse thab an mlm at this point .,Disappointing
4,2020-05-19 15:06:09,Relax Melodies has a large number of highly customizable sounds. This makes the app a really wonderful choice for a variety of situations from a need for background to help concentration to peaceful sleep sounds. My only compliant is that the app can sometimes be glitchy. It occasionally turns itself off during the night even when all settings are at continuous.,Great variety of sounds - can be glitchy
5,2019-10-18 16:24:28,"I work from home and there’s always (usually welcomed) background noise from my family. I’ve used other music or focus apps, but the focus apps usually require headphones, but this app has settings that I can use with my Bluetooth speaker. This also came in handy for our fussy baby when we struggled to get him to sleep early on.",Great White Noise for Working at Home
5,2018-11-28 03:39:40,"Personally I have trouble getting to sleep but this app is phenomenal. It comes with loads of different sounds even if you don’t have the pro application. It lets you mix up to 12 different sounds and then save and name your different mixes. There are even more things above t this app that I haven’t figured out yet. Overall, this a great app and I recommend it.",Great App!
5,2018-11-23 07:30:21,I really enjoy this app. It has so many sounds right out of the box. There’s something for everyone. I like using the oscillating fan sound under the City category. I use it when I’m away from home and do not have my air cleaner sound to help me sleep. The oscillating fan sound is the closest sound I’ve found to an air cleaner noise. Keep up the good work on this app.,Great App
5,2018-11-19 09:07:07,"I never rate. This deserves the time after putting me to sleep many a sleepless nights. Helps me through a failing back and the pain that comes with it. Or just when worries cause sleep problems. That’s with what they so generously allow for free. Thank you, want to upgrade soon the rest I’m sure is awesome as well. You need this if your already checking it out!!!",Love this app
5,2018-11-09 07:49:40,"Perfect ability to create your own sounds to sleep by. Almost unlimited possibilities. They took great care in making major themes in sounds non-repetitive which was huge for me. If my brain could hear the pattern, I was turned off. The music backdrops have transitions that are smooth, seamless, and lead back to the beginning without sounding like it. Very happy with it.",Best sleep app ever
5,2018-11-07 02:03:03,"Instead of buying a noise maker to put you to sleep, why not use a free app like Relax Melodies? I just downloaded the app and the first night I tried it, it put me to sleep within a half hour at the most. So stop spending your money on something that you can just get with a click through your phone! Downloaded Relax Melodies I’m sure you will love it! 🥰",Really great app
5,2018-10-18 10:21:19,I've lived this app for years. What's particularly amazing to me is the effect of layering different sounds to create the perfect environment of tranquility.    My only suggestion is that it would be lovely to have to option of switching apps while still hearing the sounds of the app. I would love to be able to listen while reading on my phone's Kindle app!,A god send for the insomniac in me
5,2018-10-17 02:48:43,"I have a hard time getting to sleep, so I’ve learned I can easily fall asleep with white noise in the background. I like how this app allows changing volume of different sounds separately. I also like all the customization options (such as timer) & the integration of other apps I use (ie Sleep Timer). Thank you for such a useful tool!",Nice options for customization
5,2018-10-11 07:34:29,My wife snores and so does my dog. I also struggle with anxiety a lot at night so all together = difficulties sleeping... the sound mixes I can make with this app helps me navigate past that and I sleep better when I remember to use it. Not gonna lie I use almost all the rain options as well as campfire together as well as the nighttime one that sounds like frogs and crickets... paradise for me.,Super Helpful!
4,2018-10-15 17:12:09,"I’ve suffered from Tinnitus my whole life and have turned to apps such as these. I find a greater comfort in the customization of the sounds I can hear to drown out the loud ringing and high pitch in my ear. Other apps it is one sounds you can change the volume or pitch, this app I can add up to like 11 distinct sounds to make a realistic white noise I can fall asleep or work to. Thank you for the comfort you have provided through the app!",Helps soothe Tinnitus
5,2018-10-10 04:29:21,"With the many combinations of sounds, it’s fun and easy to create an ambient backdrop for rest and relaxation. I have used this app every night and find myself able to clear my mind of the busy minutia of the work-a-day world. I am able to relax in the evening and drift off at night. I definitely recommend to anyone desiring to reset the mind and body after a hectic day.",Very Relaxing!
5,2018-09-30 03:17:58,Great app. Husband bought me a new sound machine for bday but it makes a feedback noise so I couldn't stand it. I had this app for when I was traveling and just decided to start using it every nite. I really like how you can layer the sounds. That really helps me find the right combo to be able to sleep over the gaming noises in my house.,Now I can sleep over the sounds of gunfire.
5,2018-09-15 05:12:25,"I often have trouble with insomnia, and even with the help of Xanax or Ambien, my mind still won't shut down sometimes. Love the way I can mix and match sounds (and volume of each) in this app. My favorite sounds are the rain ones and the cat purring!  Makes me zone out and forget that I'm trying to fall asleep - instead, I just fall asleep, period.",Helps me fall asleep faster
5,2018-09-01 23:01:22,"I've had this app for years. I regularly use it in place of a sound machine for our young son while on vacation. Rain+waves does the trick every time! I've never had a problem with the app crashing, it is consistent with many great sounds to choose from.  I also use it to help with my meditation/relaxation. So many sounds combinations to choose from!",Love this app!
4,2018-09-09 03:19:21,"I love the various sounds and the fact that you can control the volume of each individual sound. It really lets you customize and create your perfect sleep sounds! It used to have a guided relaxation and meditation program built in and it helped me relax a lot, but they got rid of that option (or you have to pay for it now). I would recommend this app however.",Helps me sleep every night!
5,2018-08-10 05:03:28,"It usually took me about an hour to fall asleep , but after I started using this app (about 2 months ago) I've fallen asleep in less than 30 minutes! Definitely recommend this app because you can customize your sleep song and pick whatever sounds help you fall asleep faster (for me it's rain and cats purring)",Helps me sleep better
5,2018-08-07 03:51:48,"My son, age 13, has been addicted to the sound of a fan when sleeping since before I can remember. This Summer we were on vacation and gasp: he found himself without a fan!!! Luckily we had WiFi and he found Relax Melodies. I have become a fan for my own sleep as well. So much fun to play with the different sounds and create a perfect tincture for sleep.",Teenager using for better sleep!
5,2018-07-24 04:30:07,"This app was exactly what we were looking for when our 11 year old said she ""seemed to sleep better when she could listen to the ocean."" There are several relaxing sounds with the free version & the ability to adjust the volume of the individual sounds allows to create the best melody for each of us. LOVE this app!!!",Huge selection of sounds
5,2018-06-30 17:09:42,"First off, I apologize for my cranky response to loosing all my subscription benefits, instead of writing a cranky review, I should have emailed the app developer directly with my concerns.   Second, I want to say thank you for the response from the developer. They emailed me and offered a fix which was able to be done via the settings app.   If you’ve lost all your subscription access, I suggest emailing the developer directly instead of putting them on blast like I did and feeling like a jerk at the end of the day...  Again, thank you to the developer for responding and fixing my app, I’m looking forward to a fabulous nights sleep tonight!! (And you’ve saved me from being so cranky)",I apologize
5,2018-06-21 04:59:39,I’ve been using this app for about 1-2 years on all business and personal trips. I sleep with a fan at home but find few hotel rooms have a good fan  (even those tied to an external heat and cooling system) to drown other guests or freeway noise. This apps white noise does the trick and even drowns out my snoring when family travels with me.   Love it...don’t know how I survived with out it!  Casey,Getta great night sleep
5,2018-06-03 07:19:11,This app is great with helping my fall asleep within minutes. I haven't had trouble falling asleep since I downloaded it. And some sounds help me focus when I’m studying or creating something the timer is great too so you don’t have to worry about it being on all night and I know when it’s time to take a break from studying and creating.,Best sleeping app
5,2018-05-31 02:02:21,"I’ve had this app for two years now, and I cant praise it enough! I'm a blogger and a creative writer and I need lots of concentration. Total silence does not work for me, this app does the job! And when it's time for bed, and my mind is racing with a thousand thoughts, the sound Toskana drifts me to the best sleep within minutes. My 7 year old loves the Medieval sound when it’s time for bed. Hands down, awesome!",Love love love
2,2018-05-31 20:58:13,"Evidently, if this thing is running while Apple decides to update IOS, bad things happen. At least they did to me. And then while trying to fix the broken stuff, this app charged me $21 for an “in-app” purchase, which I certainly never did on purpose. Apple easily refunded it, which to me either means these guys are good people and allowed the refund without argument, or that Apple has seen this so many times that they knew I’d been scammed. No idea which is the reality.   My experience may be isolated. It seemed like a great app while I was using it.",Seemed ok - not sure now
5,2018-05-26 05:09:36,"I use this app every time I go to sleep. The sounds are wonderful and it just relaxes me a lot. I just wish the sounds didn’t interfere with your alarms. One time I didn’t put a timer for my sound to turn off so it just kept playing. However, my alarm didn’t go off the next morning. Overall, this is such an amazing app and I totally recommend it.",Amazing
5,2018-05-09 04:08:05,"We used to use this app to relax before sleeping, but with a new baby there is none of that for us but only for our baby! He LOVES the relaxing sounds and we LOVE all the different mix we can create to keep soothe him to sleep and then to keep him sleeping. You got everything from white noise, to lullabies, to Zen sounds. Best part is that I can share my share my mixes with my hubby!",Baby loves this app!
5,2018-04-28 01:13:53,Oh my goodness (kinda sound Cheesy 😜) this is an amazing app!!! I would defiantly recommend this to everyone on the go a lot and forgets a sound (if your like me aI need something to sleep with) 😍😍😍😍😍😍 its 1 of the best apps I have and i just absolutely recommend it!!!!!!!!😊🙌🏻😅😊😁😜😝😴 in this app you can make different combinations of sound and how many you want!!!! SOOOOO definitely get if your reading this!!!!! Byyye!!!!!,THIS IS A AMAZING APP!!!!!!!!
5,2018-03-04 07:34:49,I love this app because it has so many sounds that you can mix and match. The full version even let's you add in binaural beats in the background. I do wish it were easier to manage which sounds you have on without having to scroll through the entire sound list. Overall very good.,A little expensive but worth it
5,2018-02-27 05:26:16,"In 5 years I have only purchased 4 apps. This is one of them, and well worth the price.   The voice over for the meditation is perfect for me and I use the custom sounds almost every night. Another unexpected benefit was playing sounds while my children did their homework. Focus, attention to detail and creativity were definitely enhanced.  Great software :)",Amazing
5,2017-12-28 10:05:13,"This app is everything that I could ask for in regards to calm, simple and relaxing music/sounds. I love how I can create my own or listen to others.   If you’re looking for an app for sleepy sounds THIS is what you want. And it had a timer so the app will close after a certain time, so I don’t have to worry about a dead or over charged battery. 10/10",Excellent app!
5,2017-10-01 17:25:25,I tried a few of the other freemium apps in the store and this one turned out to be the best. There are lots of sounds available without a subscription that you can play simultaneously for your own custom mix. Currently they have a lifetime subscription promo for $20 that I'm super tempted to take up which unlocks lots more sounds.,Free version better than the rest!
4,2017-11-10 12:38:13,I listen to these on my cell phone all night as a white noise machine.  I listen to a combination of night and peepers. I really like how there isn't a repeat at all. I do wish a lot of the sounds were a lower slower pitch. Like brown noise and a lot of the water sounds. They're so high pitched and fast that they're stimulating instead of being able to put me to sleep. As far as the other noises I really don't have much use for them.,Sleep time
4,2017-10-05 21:46:02,"I was heartbroken when my previous “sleep sounds” app was dumped by iOS 11.  After downloading this one, I am very pleased so far. This app is well thought out and beautifully put together. The reasons I gave the app 4-stars and not 5, are that the current lifetime access price for the pro version is $20.  Seems like $5 would be more reasonable.  Also, selection of available sounds could stand to be increased dramatically.",Very nice app
5,2017-09-14 03:58:32,Love the alarm feature of this app! It gradually increases in volume and can be adjusted from 30 seconds of crescendo to 10 minutes. I set mine for 5 minutes and have really enjoyed being awakened so gently every morning. I'm finding I'm waking up much easier since using this app.   The sounds effects are fun too! I especially enjoy the rain or thunderstorm sounds.,LOVE this app!!
5,2017-09-09 10:47:29,Great app! Been using the free version for a month now after a pretty rough surgery. Has been a invaluable tool during recovery to help me meditate during some tough times in a house thats too small to escape noise from kids sometimes. Put on the headphones and block out and meditate the pain away.,"Love it, wish the full version was a little cheaper so i could try it sooner"
5,2017-08-25 03:20:13,"I have never been able to find such an app that one can customize so much to their own liking! I have been creating my own favorites with the sounds I love most. Not only do I sleep better at night when using the app, but it also helps me concentrate while reading and sometimes simply daydream. I highly recommend this app!","So Relaxing, like REALLY!!!!"
5,2017-06-28 16:28:22,"I haven't splurged on the subscription (yet), but am really thinking about upgrading. I love the free options - especially the concentration and relaxation tones that play behind the other sounds, like rain, ocean waves, etc. Overall really great app for many situations like falling asleep or working with focus-oriented white noise in the background. Again, I highly recommend this app!",Highly recommended
5,2017-06-26 10:08:35,"I don't know about you, but when it's 'too' quiet at night I can't sleep and I like to hear some type of white noise. Especially when I'm traveling with my children. We sleep in the same room and they wake up with every little move I make. With the different sounds I can drown out the noises I make and we all get a better nights sleep 👍🏽😊💤😴",Better sleep
5,2017-06-21 04:50:55,This app always help me relax before and while doing homework. You can overlay different noises to make the perfect combination for anything. I also have noises for falling asleep. Every night I listen to it and it automatically shuts of after 30 min when I tell it too. This is super nice because I don't have to worry about it playing all night! Overall great app.,Honest Review
5,2023-10-03 11:01:26,"I used another sleep app and didnt continue it. Then I tried a playlist. I still had insomnia.   I don’t know how they figured out the formula, but for once in my life, I finally drop off to sleep. I just run it all night. Even when I have to get up to pee, it immediately puts me back to sleep.   I’m very happy.",I sleep like a baby.

5,2023-04-06 04:10:26,"I love this! It tells me the sounds. that happen near my mattress each night.  i.e. snoring, noises, traffic, music, baby crying ect.  It even records my dog snoring!  Thank goodness I can tell the difference. lol      It tells me how my sleep experience happened. Deep,REM, soft or awake. This really puts my daytime tiredness in perspective. It even has an alarm to wake me and a bedtime reminder.",I sleep to this app!!!
4,2023-06-28 14:07:20,"This is the most beautiful app for sleep! I love that i can listen to my “mix” anytime day or night and it makes me Happy 😊. I also like the feature that I can change the hours i wake up anytime, because I’m always working different shifts and hours so i can always use this to get to sleep mostly for the am hours when I get home. Thank you",Wonderfully done!
2,2023-05-13 14:58:39,"I have had this app for years and loved until recently. Every time I open the app it takes time to get through the ads. Do you want to upgrade? No, skip. Then four or five more of the same screen - do you want to upgrade? Now logging in with a new phone even the non upgraded simple rain sounds are locked. Membership needed to use any of the sounds. I understand if I was making up elaborate combinations but that is not the case",Unfortunate changes

I have been struggling to get 8 hrs of sleep even though I go to bed for 8 hrs, I toss and turn a ridiculous amount and mind just doesn’t turn off. I’ve been going to sleep faster, less movement and my score is at 80 or above which is amazing! I am using the brown and green noises - pure magic!",Working Gr8
5,2023-01-09 13:50:36,Just 2 nights in to using the app I am sleeping more soundly and staying asleep until a more reasonable time! I had basically gotten used to waking up and getting up around 3am and very restless sleep! I’m not tossing now and I have slept till 6am 2 days in a row and I feel energized instead of feeling tired and unmotivated!,After just 2 nights
5,2022-10-18 11:16:19,This app I had some doubts about it because I can not fall asleep easily so when I tried it out I fell asleep immediately the one thing about the app I would change is if more stories and songs were unlocked but otherwise this is a really great app and I recommend,I couldn’t sleep better
5,2022-06-17 07:05:13,"I originally gave it three stars because the app has some quieter sounds, but really an app that has helped me sleep every night for years now deserves more. The soundboard is just unmatched, every so often I’ll try other apps and you just cannot find one with this level of personalization.",Deserves 5 stars
4,2022-08-17 01:08:09,I use this app to help calm my mind when I'm overthinking. I like to set the mood while I journal and unload my thoughts on paper.   One thing I would like to see added would be an equalizer for the sounds so you can accentuate or decrease the high or low frequencies to tune the sound just right to your liking. Sometimes the rain is shrill or the waves are too loud when they crash.,Great Way to Center
3,2022-08-12 04:53:51,"They said I needed to write this review so that they would unlock features for me. I don’t like that I don’t have all the features already and that they’re making me write a review, so I gave them 3 stars. But overall I like the app, based on my 2 days of having it (again I don’t like being asked to write a review, especially after only having it for 2 days).",This review is a hoop they’re asking me to jump through
5,2022-01-20 06:31:00,"I am loving this app! I came for the sound mixes, but am soooo enjoying the stories and meditations.

2,2022-04-03 08:50:02,"You have taken a good app and ruined it. I can no longer use the app when I am off-line which limits its use while traveling. For such an expensive app I think I should not have to have a Wi-Fi or cell signal. The app has no search search capability and no longer has a filter capability. So, for example it I want a meditation for a short afternoon nap I have to scroll thru all the meditations. I will not renew my subscription and will look for one better suited for my lifestyle.",Bring back the old app
5,2021-10-19 02:42:31,My son with autism sometimes has difficulty getting to sleep. We discovered the Relax Melodies app a year or so ago and have been using it ever since. I’ve liked it so well that I added it to my phone too. Sometimes we listen to it in the car when we want quiet and calm travel.,Just what we needed
4,2021-12-16 19:42:53,There was an app update that has fixed this problem. I have updated my rating to 4 stars. The Apple Watch app worked fine up until a week or 2 ago and now it only crashes every time you click on it. Needs to be fixed. That is the main reason I use this app is I can access on my watch.,Responsive and works
5,2021-08-27 15:46:03,But it destroys my battery. I have to leave my phone plugged in any time I turn this on and that wears the battery down over time. So I have to wait until morning to turn it on to try to get as much sleep as possible and usually by then it’s too late. Great app though. It works and saves your sounds.,Great app
5,2021-08-13 06:41:05,I’ve been using this app for years and it keeps getting better! Luckily they have all the tones I still love from years past and they’ve added so many new features that are super cool. Is nice to be able to create your own mixes and save them so you can have multiple calming “moods.”,Helps me fall asleep
5,2021-08-10 06:57:47,"I love this app so much, specially because I can customize my own time and sound when I’m ready to meditate or fall asleep. It is also amazing that most of it is free but you can purchase more if you want a better at experience. Would definitely recommend and will continue to use it!",Absolutely amazing!
5,2021-06-27 19:19:12,I got this app yeaaars ago and bought the premium version before it changed to a subscription service. I’m so glad I did - this app is perfect for filling my brain with stimulus when I’m feeling extra distractible. The rain sounds feel extra good on my noggin. I don’t think I’d ever pay for the subscription though.,fantastic
5,2021-06-24 09:00:24,It’s WOW like just WOW🤩... The best part is that you get to create your own sound and I love ❤️ the way rain sounds so it’s really good thing to be able to have all the sounds you like to hear when your sleep so that was definitely my favorite part for sure(LOVED IT)🥰😍.....10/10 definitely recommend to have this app because it’s amazing🤩🥰,The BEST SLEEPING APP
5,2021-06-02 04:48:21,"Love this app. I used the free stuff but ended up paying for the premium access. It is hands down the best ""soothing sounds"" I have found and I have searched far and wide especially during the pandemic. It's been hard to sleep or concentrate or block out my noisy neighbors and this helped a lot.",Love. Has made a huge difference!

5,2021-05-02 03:47:06,"Great app, but herky-jerky performance: -never know if it will keep playing the background noise all night or stop after a period -sometimes will launch 2 noises at same time -meditation option sometimes won’t continue playing background music after meditation is over",Inconsistent performance
5,2020-05-28 21:11:35,I reverted back to 5 stars pending the future update mentioned in the devs reply.   I used this app for years to create custom sounds while listening to sleep stories in other apps such as Slumber. With this update Relax Melodies can’t play sounds while audio from another app is being played. I hope this isn’t intended and will be fixed soon as there is no reason for this change.  Update to the devs reply.   The update broke that. That is problem it doesn’t play in the background anymore. The setting you are referring to is not available.   There is no support email in the app or on the website. I’d be happy to contact you by email.,Update breaks background play
4,2020-12-12 04:28:38,Relax Modes is AWESOME I helps me fall asleep so much quicker. It’s just so nice to drift off to sleep peacefully. I can create my own mix witch was just was I was looking for. I created a beautiful mix. Definitely go ahead and try this app. I would say the only down side is if you want more choices you have to do a subscription. Witch isn’t the best but they give you some pretty good options to pick from with out the trial. Good luck hope you like it!,Awesome
3,2020-10-26 04:24:17,"I use this app religiously when I am traveling since I like to have noise on in the background when I sleep. I’ve always used one sound - oscillating fan.

I’m baffled how it was there just a week ago when I was last traveling and as of last night, it’s disappeared.",Am I missing something?!
4,2020-07-02 03:31:30,The app sounds are great and very relaxing. The problem I’m having is that the music in my mixes is not available offline. So when I play my favorite mixes the music portion does not play when I’m not connected to the internet. Why? Why can’t I download the music like I do the sounds?  I like to listen to this while camping and do not have internet access. I purchased the subscription. Thanks.,Good app - usage confusing

5,2019-06-19 03:29:57,"I love this app so much. Usually I end up finding most sound apps annoying, but the way you can customize the sounds makes this the best sound app I’ve ever used.

1,2019-07-08 05:49:30,"I’ve had this app for years and use it every now and again to help me sleep. I opened it today and turned on the sounds that I normally play, and they are totally different.   They sound more like cheap sound effects rather than the actual recordings like they used to. I don’t know if they now have moved those to the paid service or what, but the new sounds are extremely artificial and repetitive (you can immediately tell when they loop back around)  I’ll be deleting this app after writing this review.",Completely changed all the sounds in the app

I started using it to help drown out his snoring and helps for the most part to get me to sleep more soundly. If his snoring wakes me and I can’t fall back asleep, I’ll set the timer again.

I also really appreciate the fact that it runs the whole night and doesn't stop after a set amount of time, as I don't like waking up to silence. Maybe make more music available for the free version? It has a lot of sounds and not enough music available.",Good app
4,2018-09-23 05:54:48,I enjoy relaxing music and ambient sound (my computer hum and fans definitely accompany me each night I’m at home!) this app makes it easy to come up with new and interesting combinations.  I look forward to becoming a PRO member soon!  Only negative is that some of the sounds (Medieval is my favorite) are a bit too short and thus feel a bit too repetitive if you use it for too long.,Love the many combinations!
2,2018-08-18 12:19:40,"I used this app for a long time. But recently as of today I’ve decided to discontinue its use. For the last couple days the app will turn off on its own in the middle of the night. I’m an extremely light sleeper, and any change in noise will wake me up (even the sound turning off). Last night it did it twice in the middle of the night. I decided after it disturbed me the second time to just leave it off.

If your mind doesn’t stop worrying you trying to choose The best listening options will at least keep you distracted which will help break your focus on what’s bothering you. Also I recommend getting the pro pack- way more options and it doesn’t take up too much space on my phone,Good anxiety relief

5,2017-09-19 11:32:52,Great app with tons of customization even without paying anything. The ability to choose your own custom melody and set it as your alarm is great but the best part is that you can choose to have it gradually increase in volume over time. This helps you wake up slower and more naturally. It's really helped me with waking up earlier.,Much better way to wake up!

It's great that you can customize the sounds to create a melody that is pleasing to your ear and even adjust the volume of each overlapping sound.

4,2023-08-15 13:51:13,"A feature came out briefly that corresponded times throughout the night of disturbances with the sleep phase on the actual sleep graph. That was only temporary and I miss it!   Also, the sleep graph cannot be considered accurate unless you have it synced with a watch or some device worn at night. I've tried to find out *how* it decides you are awake or in REM sleep etc., but I can't. Clearly it is guessing incorrectly.   But I do use the app to record the hours I'm in bed, and for the drift-off sound features. Just take the actual sleep data with a grain of salt.   Customer service is AWESOME. They respond to email inquiries and seemingly from real people! 😉  Thank you!",Graph pinpoint feature; great customer service

However, it falls short because you cannot use other apps at the same time (at least that's how it is on the iPhone). If you attempt to do something else on the phone, the sounds stop.

I could not get back to sleep for anything, I remembered I had this app on my phone. I found the oscillating fan sound & added the thunder, took about 5 min or so & I was out like a light! Slept so good the rest of the week listening to this app instead of 5 snoring pups. What a lifesaver!!!",Away from home without a fan
5,2018-09-18 19:06:42,"I’m from Tx but visiting my Son in Wa.. it’s hard to get a good notes sleep in a different bed so, I download a great FREE App this App is great!! It has a great variety of sounds to rest to pick your choice!!! It also has a timer so, if you normally go to sleep after 15 min. You set that or you might take 1 hour set that then it turns off to save battery power, I think it’s GREAT!!!",Rain Sounds To Sleep To!!
5,2018-09-11 20:17:01,"Relax melodies is a beautifully designed app with more than hundred relaxing tones and many more features like guided meditation, setting up a timer etc. You can customize and mix the tones as per your liking. Play the app in the background and fall asleep in no time. I frequently use the app during my yoga sessions as well.",Get this app. You will be glad you did.
4,2018-09-17 19:35:19,"I love this app. There are so many awesome things about it. However, you lost a star because I bought the premium version and I keep having problems downloading one of the sound packages. The deep relaxation with meditation will act like it's downloading and then not actually download. I'm really disappointed because that was one of the things I was looking forward to with my purchase. Please fix this bug.",Love it!
5,2018-09-09 05:42:50,"Relax melodies is what I use to go to bed every night. The best part is it is free! You can purchase pro, but they have so many sounds that at no extra cost which actually work for me. There is a timer you can adjust so the sounds stop automatically and they exit out of the app without you having to do anything.",So helpful and reliable
5,2018-08-25 15:37:11,"Thank you so much for inventing “Sleep melodies” My husband & I use to have troubles sleeping at night, and now after using it we sleep through the night. There’s not one night we don’t turn it on. We’ve made it our daily ritual to put it on with the “I Am Affirmations” we let it play all night long we up in a very happy mood.....

5,2018-08-24 03:34:55,"I have had the free version for 5 years now and it is so relaxing. Perfect for literally anything! Studying, relaxing, sleeping, and even calming down babies! I love using it while studying because there is noise in the room and it doesn’t distract me. Even without paying there are still a wide variety of noises. My personal favorite is eternity! I give this app a full recommendation!",Splendid!
5,2018-08-05 03:37:32,"If you like going to sleep listening to thunder storms, wind, & rain, then this is the app for you. I use it frequently as I have a problem falling asleep, even though I take melatonin, to fall asleep. I do have the advantage of having a metal roof, so the relaxing effect is multiplied by the sound of the rain hitting the roof. I highly recommend the app, you will be surprised at the therapeutic nature of it.",Thunder Storms
5,2018-07-11 01:37:49,I downloaded this to use with some children I work with at a daycare to get them to sleep during nap time. Now I've ended up using it as well at night when I have trouble getting to sleep. Love how there's a great variety of sounds to choose from and how realistic they sound. Very soothing! Would definitely recommend to someone,Great sound machine app
5,2018-06-22 07:21:32,"There’s a wide range of good, soothing sounds that range from constant tones to nature noises (wind, crickets, rain, etc etc). I have a lot of fun just going through the list and combining a few. My faves are tiny, far frogs (“peepers”) with fire crackle, and crickets (“night”) with distant train. And I only have the free version, too; looks like paid would be well worth it!",Many good sounds to choose from
5,2018-06-19 08:56:45,"Have usedsounds n times for decades now. Started back during nature sound cassettes. Lol.  The sound machines n several apps since the smart phone era.  This is by far the best one available.  My sons have developed their own individual programs for different purposes. Sleeping, concentration for home work, n calming n relaxation as both are challenged by generalized anxiety disorder. I use mainly for sleep.",Love this program
5,2018-05-29 06:14:59,"Came back from a trip where we were using white noise to help us sleep to our quiet apartment, all I could focus on was the ticking clock and my husbands snores.. quick all search and voila! Perfect noise app for sleep!! I love how you can mix each sound to create your perfect blend. I also love the timer function so it doesn't have to run all night. Great app!!",Just right
4,2018-06-10 07:24:41,"I have used this app for over a year now and it's great. I use about 4 different sounds together and they put me right to sleep. I travel for work and sleep in hotels alot. So at night I hear everything, doors slamming, showers, baby's, dogs, cars... You name. When I turn this app on the next thing I hear is my alarm. But the app use to be a little buggy but it seems to be alot better than ever before!",Best for when I travel
5,2018-05-18 02:17:01,This app has helped me a lot with my connection with God. As a 14 year old boy I always have questions about God and wanting to connect with him. I feel the app with their idea of mindfulness is just opening my mind for God. When I enter stages of meditation it helps me get closer and closer to God every time. I would recommend this app even if you were non-religious too.,Greater Connection With God
4,2018-05-19 21:35:50,"Can't say enough about this app and the amazing creativity it provides. You can find the perfect, eclectic blend of nature sounds, binaural beats, and New Age music. This would be five stars if it weren't for requiring me to create a review to access two new sound - after having purchased the lifetime subscription. Just sort of made the experience feel cheap, and perhaps buying a subscription a bit pointless.","Great App, Sucky Review requirement."
4,2018-05-18 04:45:35,"If you are looking for an app to help you relax or sleep, this one is definitely worth a try. I’m a light sleeper and have a lot of trouble falling asleep, but I’m starting to see improvement after using this app for a month. It’s easy to use and I love that I can set a timer so that the app doesn't play continuously while I sleep and waste my battery. There are lots of sounds and combinations to listen to with the free version.",Great App!
5,2018-05-16 03:18:36,I have tried a lot of things to help sleep better at night. This is the most effective thing I have ever tried. I have tracked my sleep cycle using the Fitbit before and after using the white noise app and the improvement in sleep was not just perceived but measured with the Fitbit and the difference was remarkable. This app is natural and highly effective. Get it and sleep well.,Best Sleep Ever
5,2018-04-09 02:21:41,"I like the flexibility available in the Melodies app. We can be our own composers, or enjoy others’ creations. I use the almost every night to fall to sleep, or to return to sleep if I’m having trouble sleeping. The exit timer is nice, or you can just let it run, and being able to vary the volume of each component is nice. Give it a try, you’ll like it!",My ritual
5,2018-02-07 08:59:18,"I created a melody that I used to fall asleep to as a child. My mom had a painting in my room of a hug waterfall that you could plug in the wall. It’ll light up and have sounds of the waterfall, birds, and other sounds from nature that serenaded me to sleep. This app is as close as I’ll get to that painting and it does a great job! I haven’t went pro yet because my favorites are in the free version.",Peace at last
5,2018-02-05 03:02:27,There’s nothing better than going to sleep next to the babbling river or listening to the sounds of the ocean waves all within the solitude of your bedroom (or wherever you might be sleeping). I’ve owned sound machines and nothing compares to this app. Try it! You won’t be disappointed with all the different selections you can combine together.,Want a good nights sleep? Use this app...
5,2018-01-25 06:57:35,I used to go to sleep with no structure and just be on my phone or watch tv till i fall asleep but when i keep my favorite blend of sounds on at night I actually peacefully fall asleep and dont get paranoid about small sounds through the night. I feel like it also helps me wake up naturally at a good hour rather than waking up to a loud alarm.,Changed my life
5,2018-01-06 17:27:32,"I love this app. I used it four years ago to help my baby go to sleep or simply keep her calm. You can mix all the sounds with their individual volume, and then you can even open itunes and play music over it. Now I came back to it to help with my tinnitus and to hide my husband’s snoring, and it’s working really well! This is an app I keep on coming back to. I love it!",The best!
5,2018-01-02 07:36:43,"I forgot my noise machine, and needed something to block out a crying baby, this app did the trick! Not only is it easy to use, but it also allows you to get creative by making your own sound mixes from a variety of different sounds and melodies. There is something for both the city dweller, the nature lover, and everything in between.",So relaxing!
5,2017-10-28 02:57:29,"While being away from home on a speaking appointment, I could not sleep. After trying several apps, i stumbled on this one. This one worked great. No turning back. The sounds are just better quality. I also love how you can mix them.  I even used it in one of my presentations as an illustration for stress relief. Thank you. I appreciate this so much.",It works!!!
4,2017-12-06 06:05:47,"I have a couple of apps like this on my phone- one that has an interface like a 1980 computer and the other is too simple. This one could be accused of also being oversimplified, but it works well and the noise choices are pretty extensive. There could be some more control added for the users as far as timers to end what you’re listening to and fade in and out.",Quite like it
5,2017-10-26 03:33:26,"This app has many options, many sounds, and high quality. It is my go-to sounds for relaxation and sleep app. The variety allows combining favorites and there is something to suit every mood or need. Check out other sound apps by this developer as they’re also high quality!","High quality sounds, lots of variety"
5,2017-10-23 03:08:23,"I LOVE this app, it really helps me calm down and easily makes me fall asleep... which is good considering that I suffer from multiple forms of anxiety and I have a lot of phobias. Trust me, you don't even wanna know what goes on in my head. It goes from being happy to listening to voices telling me that I'm failing at life. o.o' Oh! Right! I'm supposed to be reviewing the app! ^_^' It's extremely useful and I highly recommend it!",Amazing.
5,2017-10-22 14:55:01,I downloaded the app for soothing white noise to help me eliminate distractions during my long office days. But what I discovered was so much more. The list of options and the ability to layer sounds and differing volumes allows for a truly customized experience. Perfect for so many different settings ... not just white background noise or falling asleep. You won't be disappointed!,Perfection!
5,2017-10-11 09:49:53,"It was recommended that I find an ""sleep app"" to, well, help me sleep. I came across this one and what a difference it made!  For the first time in over a year, Ive been sleeping soundly!  I pick a few sounds, set the 30 minute timer, concentrate on the sounds and I'm asleep before the timer turns the app off.   I highly recommend this if you're having trouble sleeping!",Great App!
5,2017-06-12 05:35:30,"I typically listen to the spa station on the spa pandora app to help me relax, nap and/or wind down for the evening.   A co-worker told me about this app and I decided to test it out and for the past week, it has been my go to!

Great app!",Snoozetastic
4,2017-07-02 07:53:33,"There's not much to review. Every night I usually use this to wind down, read a book and get my body prepared for sleep. Sure not everything is free, but you don't need every. single. sound, do you? Anyways, the sounds are very relaxing (i suggest typical rain or ocean waves), and overall it's been helping me fall asleep and stay asleep. It's just a basic free app that will do you more than an expensive noise machine.",I use this 24/7.
5,2017-06-10 03:12:30,"I have trouble falling asleep when the room is completely silent. I find that my mind keeps turning. I've tried different sound apps but the sounds were limited. I love that you can use one favorite sound, or layer multiple together. You get to make your own soothing lullaby. There are even some that I was amazed to find as favorites, like the purring cat!",The Best Sleeping App!
5,2023-08-25 01:43:09,I’ve used this app for a few years now and it have never disappointed me. I love the many options it provides and it’s constantly adding new features that are even better. Great for helping me relax and unwind after a long day. It’s also great for helping soothe a fussy baby 😊,Will love this app forever
5,2023-08-14 13:30:48,"I have severe tinnitus in my left ear. Since getting the diagnosis and recommendation to use an app to balance the sounds in my ear, I’ve been sleeping so much better. I can adjust sounds to match whatever level my ear is at that day with this app. I have been using this app for the last 6 years and very happy with it.",Love this app!
5,2023-08-07 02:59:32,"I like it!! I really only do one meditation about living in the present moment, but it’s great! I’ve messed around with the sound mixer too and I’ve really enjoyed some rainy cricket noises. Highly recommend! Most of the stuff is free, but some of the weirder or cooler stuff costs money. I’ve never got the subscription though",Freaking awesome and stuff
5,2023-08-06 02:28:42,"If I fell on hard times, this would be the last subscription I would cancel. Between being a first responder and a parent, sleep is sacred and when I have time to sleep, I can’t afford to lie awake. Even on nights when I can’t listen to this, the meditations have taught me relaxation techniques that I will always use.",I swear by it
5,2023-07-21 02:44:16,I use this app every day.   I listen to music wirh nature sounds in my office during the day & at night I listen to a meditation or story while I fall asleep.  Invaluable experiences.   Relaxing & soothing.  I have been using the app for over a year & Im sure I’ll be using it for much longer.  Worth every penny!   I highly recommend it!,Truly amazing!
5,2023-03-01 05:00:43,"I have trouble falling asleep due to anxiety, but this app lets me find whatever soothing combo of sounds I need every night.

5,2022-12-16 08:09:38,"It’s really hard for me to fall asleep. If it’s not from over thinking it’s about chronic pain. I was talking to my Son and he told me about this app. He sent me a link to his sounds and it was perfect. Before I knew it I woke up!! It totally made me relax enough to fall asleep. Thanks Better Sleep! Or should I say, Thanks Son💕",Rest faster to a better sleep
4,2023-03-01 03:45:46,Hear me out now. I get that they have to make money in other ways but a lot of people need more sounds to sleep but have less money and I'm one of those people. I've done the math and it's really expensive and my friend did the free trial and couldn't delete it. There should really be a lower cost and not everything should be locked,Okay but some problems
4,2023-01-20 17:56:32,"I have found some wonderfully relaxing audio that helps me unwind my mind. However, it’s hard to search for the kind I like and if I found one I enjoyed, if I don’t tap the heart when it pops up the next day, I can have a hard time finding it again. I don’t see a search function on the app. That would help a lot.","Wonderful audio, Hard to search"
3,2022-12-23 13:12:56,I got this app about a month ago or less and I used it once but the sleep tracker doesn’t work because I didn’t buy it and the reason I got this app is because I wanted hear all the different color sounds and I only have one I can listen to but I want to listen and compare them. Over all I think there are probably better sleep apps out there and I just don’t know if there is any point in this app,Ok app
5,2022-10-16 09:44:59,"I’ve used this app for over 5 years EVERY SINGKE NIGHT and the “Oscillating Fan” noise has been the only thing to help me sleep. I can’t live without it, not being dramatic at all, it was life changing for me. I’ve had so many people in my life start using it. 10/10 this is a must have app!",I can’t live without the “fan” sound
5,2022-06-03 05:07:48,I use this app exclusively as a sound machine when I don’t have access to my normal actual sound machine. It’s super handy in a pinch. I love the level of customization I can get with all the different free sounds and volume controls for each. It’s just what I needed!,Easy to use sound machine function with nice free features
3,2022-10-16 09:28:31,I've loved this app ever since I bought it however recently it just suddenly stopped letting me in the app. I tried everything to troubleshooting my phone and re downloading the app and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING worked. I'm very tempted to get rid of it honestly but it pains me to do so because this app is genuinely brilliant in helping me sleep and I don't wanna get rid of it. Are the server's down? Is there anyone who can at least help me troubleshoot it?,It's good. But one problem
4,2022-10-13 10:17:10,"I love being able to track and record my sleeping habits. Plus almost all of the sounds on here are truly  relaxing. I have so much to choose from every night - from a sleep meditation to forest sounds and tropical birds. Also great because I’m pretty sure you can mix as many sounds as you want, which most sleep apps only allow like 3! Love this.",Super relaxing!
5,2022-04-14 02:54:40,I’m gonna be pretty honest it’s pretty great I use it when I’m having a anxiety panic attacks and can’t get grounded this helps me seal out the triggers of ptsd and helps me ground myself and it works pretty well haven’t really had anything help with that as much as this app has. It also is great for falling asleep and soothing the mind and helps relax before bed.,Perfect
4,2022-05-26 06:36:38,"Using this app, I was able to track my sleep habits including snoring, talking, and coughing. The sound provided a peaceful transition to a beautiful deep sleep. You can also create your own background music which was a plus. My only con is the subscription you have to pay to actually listen to your habits. I would be susceptible to subscribe if the fee wasn’t as expensive.",Great App
5,2021-12-29 10:12:05,Before I used this app I would be tired and annoyed but when I could go to bed I would be awake. I used to go to sleep at 1:55am and wake up at 9:45am but now I go to sleep at 11:45pm (sometimes 12) and wake up at 8:15am and have enough energy for school! 10/10 would recommend,I’ve been able to sleep better!
5,2021-09-13 20:55:52,Awesome app! I not only use it for sleep but I also use it for daily meditation. I really love the stories that I fall asleep to very easily. But I also like the medication for sleep as well. I highly recommend this application for those that are mindful and are looking for a great app to help them sleep too. Not to mention it’s very reasonably priced.,Great app
2,2021-12-03 03:58:14,I bought the premium version of Relax Melodies before it became better sleep but now that you all have changed your name and made me update I’m being asked to purchase another premium subscription which is really frustrating because I loved this app and used it nightly. Now I cannot access any of the “premium” content. I paid for this once already why is it being required of me to pay for a subscription again.,A little frustrated..
3,2021-10-04 05:06:08,I love this app and could change sounds based on what my needs were to relax. I used it for quite a while. Then it just quit. I tried deleting and adding it back and nothing but a basic Home Screen and no options. I only give 3 stars because I can't access it any longer. While being able to access it I would say five stars for sure.,It was great for a while and stopped working.
2,2021-09-18 00:30:14,This app has been good to me up until today when it stopped playing half of my mix when phone placed on airplane mode. Does it with 2 of my mixes- stops playing the piano but a different mix is fine without any sort of internet connection. I played this particular mix for a few nights without a connection just fine but out of the blue today it decided to crap out when I put my phone on airplane mode. Highly disappointed,Drops out without WiFi

5,2021-05-31 20:10:13,Love the app but it’s not cheap for the year. Why then are they suddenly fouling the buttons at the bottom and ruining my experience with ads??? Are they hurting for money or did someone o their team make a really stupid mistake??  paying customers should not have ads,Would have given them a 5 a week ago

5,2020-05-16 09:57:51,I might not use it everyday. But it's there when I need it. I happened to get the lifetime access so I don't have to pay the monthly subscription. There are a few bugs though. The staff are helpful if you email them with questions. Overall it's a good app. Kind of mad I had to pay for the extras. At least it was only once.,It's a good app

2,2019-09-15 07:04:38,"I've used this app for years.  It use to have an alarm feature to stop the sound at a set time, the latest update took that away.  It was great because if I woke up in the middle of the night and I heard the app I could fall back to sleep without checking the clock and enviably counting down how'd long until I had to wake up.  I don't want to calculate how long I have until I have to get up every night with the timer.  I like the app and sounds and will continue to use until I find a better one.",Alarm gone?

My only problem with this app is that when I first purchased it, I paid $20 for a lifetime membership for all the tones.

5,2018-10-20 15:23:41,"I used to love this app, I use it to calm down in stressful situations and to fall asleep at night. Ever since the update, it doesn’t save my sounds or alarms and timers. It took me forever to remember the combination of sounds I use to sleep, I still don’t think it’s accurate.  This is so frustrating. PLEASE FIX!!! Otherwise, it’s a good app.  Update: all frustrations have been fixed and I love itttt!!!!",Ughhhhh
5,2018-10-20 02:13:08,This was the app that really helped me fall asleep. I am the type of person who needs white noise when I sleep in our power went off in the dead of winter and I could not sleep so I browse my phone at 1 AM and I found this really good app and I fell asleep like a baby and I slept until 12 and this was the best sleep I’ve had so far this month.,Good night of sleep
5,2018-09-11 03:38:54,"I need a fan to sleep, period. When I travel I only need this app and I'm happy. I've also used it to read in peace with ocean waves  and peaceful sounds when my kids are playing. I've used the meditations to calm down or be energized. This is my go to app for an immersive and customized experience.  I can combine sounds, add my own music and create favorites.",Has saved me many times!
4,2018-10-04 16:58:56,"Love that you can make your own mixes, and there are lots of sounds to choose from. The mixing option is amazing because you can choose which son you want to be more dominant. My only complaint is that it’s fairly expensive to upgrade to the better versions. I wish you could sample this sounds to make sure that the money you’re going to pay is worth it",Great options
2,2018-09-11 04:16:22,BUT... Somehow I was charged twice for the same app and it doesn't show up in my iTunes? Very strange. So basically I paid $7.00 for it... Even still after using it for so long I would totally pay $7.00 for it. I love the heartbeat sound and all the different options for rain... Rain on tent is great! And now all these years and upgrades later it keeps getting more expensive... somehow my favorites are never included in what I bought a few months ago!,"Love this app, have never slept better! Cost keeps going up!!"
5,2018-09-06 08:36:26,I have insomnia and only sleep for 4 hours a day because I have to get things done. May sound bad but I use to have to faction throughout my whole day on 43min at most so to have something that works is a blessing. I was on all these pill but I stop taking them because I hate putting chemicals in my body. This app really tells my brain to shut up,Insomnia
5,2018-09-01 05:30:35,I will turn on this app during a newborn session to calm the baby. Most of the time they love it. I will relax with it as I'm going to bed since I'm normally thinking about that I need to do the next day. I'm so happy that I upgraded to all the sounds. Has something for everyone. I love that you can mix sounds and adjust how soft or loud they are.,Love this app for my photography business
5,2018-08-28 16:51:38,"Beautiful, natural sounds and interesting combinations. It’s fun to play around with the ability to create different mixes and the ability to change the volume on individual sounds. My child enjoys being able to customize sounds and it gives me the opportunity to teach him about the different sounds too.",Beautiful
5,2018-08-12 20:59:17,"I found this app the day my wife had our 5th child. She was trying to sleep in the hospital, but there were too many noises so she asked me to find a noise app and after trying a few I found this one! It is amazing!!! My wife was able to rest peacefully for the first time in months. Thank you for the great app!!!",Helps my wife sleep when it really counts
1,2018-08-18 08:40:21,"Have loved this app for 2 years, and have often relied on it to help me fall asleep. Loved it so much that I happily bought a “lifetime” subscription for $20 6 months ago (Feb 2018). With recent update, I no longer have access to all the features. I can’t even access my saved and fav sound combos. Neither restoring purchase nor reinstalling works. I now have the “great benefit” of creating an account. I don’t want to have to create another account for yet another app, especially since I previously had full access. Restore my purchase or refund my money!",“Lifetime” membership no longer works
5,2018-07-31 06:25:46,"I struggle with sleeping and have a hard time since I get really get stressed. This app improved my sleeping and I feel better. Cool thing that this app can make your music go in a loop and play forever so it’s ok if you leave it on! Really like the app, hopefully in the future we get more sounds but this app has been working for me. Thanks to this app it helped me.   ~User",Music at its best
5,2018-07-23 05:37:01,"This app replaces the need for a sound machine as long as you plan to keep it connected to a power source. Otherwise you'll wake up with a pretty low phone or tablet battery. The ability to customize your own sleep sounds is genius, and you can now save your sound mixtures to quickly find another night.",Relax Melody app review
5,2018-07-12 09:34:59,"Even if you don’t go pro there’s tons of beautiful relaxing sounds to choose from! You can mix the sounds to fit what you want and choose the volume for each one. You can set a timer to close the app while you’re asleep so you don’t waste your battery, and you can use it for meditation as well! This is the best sleep sound app I’ve ever used.",LOVE THIS APP!!!
4,2018-07-17 01:30:34,I think that Relax Melodies is a great way to relax and wind down with a gentle touch of music. It has a great variety of natural sounds; light music; and much much more! This app is superior for me because sometimes a hard stressful day can sometimes be hard to wind down from. I love how you can adjust the volumes of each sound that you add in. I like this feature because I can't really settle for all out loud noises.,My Opinion of Relax Melodies
5,2018-07-08 07:14:19,I’ve tried several different apps and keep coming back to this one. Stays on even if I’m playing a video or music. I can layer the sounds and adjust the volume of each sound as well as overall to be able to hear music or videos better. This app has the better options out of all I’ve tried.,Best app yet
5,2018-07-08 03:08:44,"I have anxiety and this app seriously helps on nights where i need help to slow down all the thoughts and internal monologues   Simple. Straightforward. Effective with headphones or out- I have the free version and can still use it to make unique combinations, and theres a timer and an alarm, and you can control the volume of individual sounds.",Seriously in Love with this app
5,2018-06-28 14:01:49,This app has a wide range of sleep-friendly music. It's commercial free and the music actually sounds like the true sound. You can choose multiple sounds to play simultaneously or just one sound. Very user friendly. You can set as long of a timer as you want for it to go off; most apps only go to one hour max.,Highly recommended
5,2018-06-12 04:29:20,"I was upset when it didn’t seem to be saving my mixes, but it looks like it’s all fixed now! Yay! I love this app and have used it since I got my first iPhone years ago. It’s very handy in helping me sleep!  ❤️❤️❤️  Ps: sorry to the developer who responded to my last review, I didn’t see you had messaged me until I got on just a few minutes ago!",Bug Seems to Be Fixed!
5,2018-05-29 22:57:05,I have insomnia and also live in Vegas so I don’t ever sleep early. I just started using this app and I’m in love with it!! I toss and turn all night and when I have my melodies on it helps me sleep longer and better. It helps me to take deeper breaths (which we all forget to do in our long days) and helps take the ease off and meditate and helps for longer healthier slumbers!!,Insomnia
5,2018-05-26 04:50:06,"Actually, since my sound machine died, I have been using this app to help me sleep at night, the different combinations you can have, to create the perfect sound for you, it helps me so much. I am really happy that this app is free, and has a pre-base for a sound, since that’s the one I fell in love you with use every night.  You guys are the best!! <3","Easy to use. Very good, and good choices"
5,2018-05-18 04:08:20,"I love that I can mix my own sounds to create the perfect one. So it’s kind of fun mixing the sounds together! Also love that you can close the app and the mix still plays. Downloaded a different app before this one and it stopped playing if the app closed which made it useless. It was quickly deleted, I’m glad I found this one next.",Fun for a white noise app!
4,2018-05-22 14:09:55,I don’t see a need to pay the lifetime or monthly sub fees the free version of the app works just fine and has plenty of options. It is slightly annoying that you can’t save you mix anymore but doesn’t take long to set everything up. This is a great app for me I work 3rd shift and sleep during the day so this frowns out all the normal day time noise mowing neighbors barking dogs traffic ect.,No need for more then free version
5,2018-05-17 05:43:39,"I treat this app like a well written book! So many interesting finds! I bought this app because I needed a sound machine on the fly one night, because I got used to static noise. Then, I found the meditation area that can coach anyone to sleep in around ten minutes. I am truly impressed with how well studied this company is!",Not just an app…I fall asleep in ten minutes or less
5,2018-05-16 05:25:14,Hotel rooms can be so quiet at night or have random noises here and there.  I've been using this app for over a year every other week at my second home - a hotel room.  My five year old loves the various options as well.  We use it whenever we stay over at the grand parents house as well.  Great find!!,Can't fall asleep on the road without this!
5,2018-05-15 17:03:54,"The sounds are beautiful and I really like how you can create your own mixes from them. There are many sounds to choose from. Best of all, you can create your own relaxing mix. My favorites are the rain, wind, and wind chimes. It’s a great way to improve your focus at work. My concentration seems to improve when I listen to it. Highly recommended!",I love this app!
5,2018-05-11 06:19:25,"I like that you can pick from a bunch of different sounds, or make your own. It’s quiet at night where I live, and I have a hard time sleeping without background noise. The timer comes in handy so it turns off automatically instead of waking me up hours later having to turn it off. Would definitely recommend.",Love this!
5,2018-05-07 05:05:10,This app has gotten me through so many hard times. I’ve been battling with anxiety and depression for the past four years and listening to this every night helps put my mind at ease. There’s a ton of options so you can customize your sounds and even save your favorites and it rarely crashes. Thumbs up for me !,Great for putting me at ease
5,2018-04-19 03:24:17,"I started using this app because I was having trouble falling sleep, and shortly after using it I've been able to fall sleep much quicker. I love using the white noise and adding multiple different sounds depending on what mood I'm in mainly water sounds. I highly recommend it and I'm also considering purchasing the full version.",Great app for soothing relaxation
5,2018-03-29 16:21:34,"I’ve had this app for a while now and I absolutely love it. I use it to fall asleep, meditate, and just relax around the house. There aren’t ever any ad’s so it beats Pandora or any other app that I’ve tried to use to sleep/meditate, because it always interrupts at the wrong time. This app has great features and it will forever be my go-to. Work the download!!!!",Definitely worth it!
5,2018-03-11 12:39:48,This app was good until the latest iPhone update. Now it crashes and won’t open for more than a few seconds. I’m very disappointed. Edit:  the developer had me uninstall and install again and I was able to open the program. I took advantage of the lifetime promotion $20 for the app. I’m quite pleased with the purchase.,Miss the music
5,2018-03-07 04:19:36,"This app helps me to go to sleep much quicker, easier, and more comfortable. This app is very soothing and you get to chose your own sounds which helps. Plus you can set timers so it goes off at a certain time. You can make your own soundtrack of sounds so you can listen to different sounds each time you sleep. This is a helpful app and fun.",It is the best app
5,2018-02-11 20:23:55,"My mind used to wonder and worry at bedtime, which would keep me up late and the anxiety would transfer to my dreams. I have been using this app for the last five nights and I am asleep within five minutes. I decided today to purchase the pro-plan so I could start up my meditation practice again. Thank you for such a lovely experience!",Restful Sleep
4,2018-03-04 09:55:48,"It’s really good and comforting. But I don’t understand why I just straight up can’t click on certain sounds. I’m not talking about premium ones, just plain sounds. It just won’t work when I click on it. An example of this is “rain on the roof”. The only way I can get it to play is to use a preset one that has it playing, but even then, I can’t turn it off unless I clear it.",Great for the most part
5,2018-01-23 06:35:40,I’ve used it for quite a while and when I need help sleeping and clear my mind this app has helped. I love the mew addition of the meditations to help you sleep ASAP. Tried both the one that is 10 and 15 min great tools to use when needing help to sleep. Definitely recommend this app to anyone who wants just noise and not our typical radio music to fall asleep.,So far Amazing!
5,2018-01-21 06:50:57,"I usually don't have trouble sleeping but whenever I travel for business and I can't quite sleep in the hotel I'm in, this app comes in handy helping me relax so I can fall asleep quickly.

5,2018-01-16 12:18:52,"I’m able to layer sounds to create the perfect sounds for my mood and a good nights rest. It blocks out the noise of my four pre adult kids going up and down the stairs, opening and closing doors and talking in the hallways.  The sounds are more realistic then other apps so they actually sound like nature noises not just white noise.",Helps me sleep all through the night
5,2018-01-15 06:51:18,"This app is great. It has lots of good sound effects to choose from. I love that you can select multiple different sounds, including some simple background music, and layer them to make lots of stuff. I like that you can adjust the audio of each element independently, so you can really tailor it to exactly how you want it. It’s great. Definitely helps me sleep.",Awesome app
5,2018-01-12 05:06:28,"I can honestly tell you I struggle with depression and insomnia. But this has reduced my nightly depressive states to a minimum as well as helped with my sleeplessness.

This app has literally saved me along with Pillow sleep tracker. I went from 4 hours to 6 hours of sleep🙏There’s a crap ton of sounds to choose from and mix, so you honestly won’t be disappointed. There’s also a meditation option so that’s a hugeeee plus",woah
5,2017-10-19 03:47:45,I listen to this app every night for bedtime with my 2 month old and it soothes us both so much! It’s nice because it puts him right to sleep first so it allows me to take a “staycation” listening to waves crash while the monks meditate to singing bird or crickets chirping during a thunderstorm with wind chimes! I adore this multi layering app and highly recommend to anyone looking to escape for awhile:),New Mom must-have!
5,2017-08-26 08:41:50,"I have a hard time sleeping without some noise in the background, but I've found that the guided meditation is even more effective than simply picking sounds to ""fill the silence"" in my room. It truly helps me focus on relaxing my body and letting go of the stress from the day.  There's many awesome free sounds and meditations, and there are timers to close out the app too.  Great app!",Great for sleep meditation
5,2017-07-15 06:14:26,"I have trouble falling asleep at night and it leads to me being up until 2 am, having to take Motrin and drink some warm tea. But I downloaded this app and created my own melody and I am in love. I knock out in 5-10 minutes tops.

Did the free trial for one week, forgot to cancel and I’m locked in for a full year. I cancelled and now they say I can renew my second year at half price. Not a fan and it does nothing for my sleep. I won’t be renewing, I’m still trying it but it does zero help. I keep trying it because I feel obligated being locked in for the year. Wish I would’ve tried the monthly option first.",Seems better than it is.
5,2023-06-01 13:45:07,I usually toss and turn for hours before being able to fall asleep due to anxiety.

5,2023-01-24 12:47:39,I have a problem with taking forever to fall asleep. Sometimes I lay there in bed the entire night without falling asleep once.  This ACTUALLY helps me fall asleep. It’s such a blessing to be able to get the sleep I need and not feel like death the next day 😭 100% worth the subscription,It actually works
5,2023-01-09 08:20:18,I wanted something that had pink noises and a few other choices. I surprised because there was a large variety in the standard package than I expected.

5,2020-03-29 04:58:51,I have never been one to utilize apps like this. I am so glad I tried this app. It was better reviewed than some of the others I researched. I’m so glad I picked this one! It helps me and my family settle down in time for bed and I’m only able to listen to about 5 minutes of it before falling asleep at night.,What did I ever do before using this app?! I love it!
5,2020-03-13 14:48:57,"Works beyond my expectations. I have a problem with tinnitus, my audiologist recommended this app. I am trying to not be in a quiet room so this provides therapeutic background soothing tones.  An added benefit turns out to be the relaxation I’ve achieved with the app! Hence, the name Relax Melodies... An added benefit is the different meditation programs that are sublime..","Tinnitus initially, now better sleep, and better transition to sleep."
5,2020-01-31 17:09:41,"It is great and I have found that it helps me fall asleep faster and sleep through the night, only a couple of guided meditations are free, the subscription seems a bit over priced, but I have gotten what I wanted without having to subscribe, the subscription is 70$ per year, so it’s not that bad, but over all I am pleased and would suggest this app",Very happy with it
4,2019-07-06 13:47:14,"I use this app almost every night to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer! Super convenient timer so it turns off after you’ve fallen asleep, and you get to save your favorite mixes and adjust the volumes of individual sounds also. Lost one star because there are SO many locked sounds and I just wanna know what some sound like for the hell of it. But I love this app",I use it every night!
4,2018-11-26 05:09:25,"I downloaded this to use the noise to sleep through tinnitus. Worked like a charm. I started paying the subscription to access the tones, which have increased the quality of my sleep and the vividness of my dreams. I enjoy using the premade mixes, but I like the option to make my own. I also REALLY like the alarm clock which gives a gradually increasing loudness...this has become my preferred method to wake up.",Excellent sleep aid app
5,2018-11-20 03:32:37,This app offers a large variety of relaxing sounds that you can customize in combinations to give you exactly the sounds you need to sleep or cover up other sounds. Timer feature is helpful when falling asleep. There are s lot more features I haven’t even discovered yet. Definitely recommend!,Works!
5,2018-11-13 21:20:04,"I’ve been using Relax Melodies since it came out. I’ve used it to relax, meditate and get my kids to sleep in the car and stay asleep. It’s a product that became more polished through updates and feedback until it became a gem of an app. It’s a keeper and useful with headsets, in the car or as a sleep aid. It shines with its options in the paid version.",One of the originals and IMO the best
5,2018-11-12 18:40:09,Very much enjoy the way you can combine the sounds and mix the depth of each to make your own personal haven. Adding your iTunes to the mix makes it near perfect.  Near perfect because I still want more sounds in the main app...but Seasons is a great add on...just need to be combined...especially with paying for the expansion & membership.  A must for all !!,Love the App !
5,2018-11-02 04:46:19,"I absolutely LOVE this app. I’m obsessed with the sounds they offer, ones that are “made” and be able to make one that works for me. I was diagnosed with migraines and certain sounds have helped me sleep at night. I’m a stressed out college student in her masters who only sleep 4-6 hours so these really calm me enough to sleep at night!  I would recommend for any age person 👍🏼",LOVE
5,2018-10-30 05:51:52,"I love this app so much.  I have tinnitus and it helps block out the piercing sound that is always in my ears. I wish the timer would allow for more than 30 minutes though.  I use Eternal, Thunderstorm and Rain combo as my number 1 favorite but there are so many wonderful combinations you can create! Hope this review helps!",Can’t sleep without it!
5,2018-10-16 16:41:32,I took my daughter on vacation a couple years ago to New Mexico and the house has central air and we were used to using a fan so we had to download an app to give us some kind of sound to be able to sleep at night and this app was perfect. I now have a couple different mixes depending on my mood and it’s calming and relaxing,Relax Sounds
4,2018-10-17 19:17:53,Gucci i bobby in hub day is the day I get to go home haha night haha was the best night haha is a great night to sleep in the airforce night with y’all tonight and tomorrow haha was a great time with your beautiful girl I gotta is your time I wanna see ya next weekend I love ya too I love  I hope you have fun and fun night with me y’all too I wanna is a time for you haha I love ya know how much I love you too much and I’ll see ya tomorrow dude I’m going on my trip tomorrow haha,I hope you have an amazing night
5,2018-09-25 04:28:26,"After years of dealing with PTSD nightmares and constant waking, not being able to go back to sleep. No sound machine or app or medication worked well. A friend recommended this app. Now I sleep longer, more peacefully and able to go back to sleep right away. I cannot believe what a difference this has made in my life. Could not be more grateful!",Life saver
1,2018-10-16 07:09:05,"I got this to use for my baby that’s been having trouble going to sleep. They have lots of free sounds and I liked it a lot but noticed there was a womb sound in the pro version. It said it was $1.67 a month so I said why not and went for it. The sound is so quiet. Even on full blast it sounds like a whisper. Didn’t work for my baby at all. My fan is louder that that. When I went to cancel so I don’t get charged for next month, turns out they charged me for a year! I’m stuck with this for $15 a year now. I’m so frustrated.",I really liked this until they hit me with $15 fee
3,2018-10-03 02:09:07,"I like the concept of using combinations of sounds. I also like being able to put it on a timer.  I don’t meditate so I have not checked into that part of the program.  An extra star for the varied bedtime reminders!  That all being said, I think it’s annoying the way you make all of the sounds people would want, the very ones you’d have to subscribe in order to be able to use. Offer more free sounds!",Obviously wants you to subscribe!
5,2018-09-24 02:59:32,"This app is so pretty, and the sounds truly are relaxing. I love that you can create, save, and name mixes in the free version and have a really wide selection of sounds  Creative feedback: Maybe some similar sounds can be grouped/string together, like there are 4 or 5 different kinds of rain sounds but they’re all spread out","Beautiful interface, beautiful sound"
5,2018-09-20 08:48:59,I use this app on nights when I can't get the running commentary to stop in my head.  The various sounds and combinations distract the night voices inside my head with other more useful sounds.   The timer function turns off the music so I don't run my phone down while sleeping.   I use the free app. Plenty of great stuff to help you drift off to sleep.,Interesting App
5,2018-09-14 21:51:15,"I’ve been using noise making apps as long as I can remember, but this one stands apart because it really lets you craft your own personal mix. I really love being able to control the volume of each individual sound you add to your melody. All around great app,you get all you need if you do t want to pay for anything.",One of my favorite apps
5,2018-08-20 23:15:19,"I recently gave one star for this app because tons of sounds were taken away and I had to pay monthly to use them despite of paying for this app years ago. But the developer contacted me, and I was able to restore my purchase.  I am very happy I can use “dreams” sound again, which gives me vivid dreams, and I have a good night’s sleep.  Thanks!",Thanks
4,2018-08-27 00:08:22,"I love this app! I love all the possible combinations, and they really truly put me in a relaxed state. I have only tried one of the meditations but it was great. The only thing missing is a place to look at and adjust all the sounds that are currently playing so that I don't have to go searching for each sound in the long list, then turn each on and off again to get to the volume.",One of my Fav apps.
5,2018-08-19 06:20:31,This app has helped me with my anxiety. I turn it on when I go to sleep at night and with the timer function it turns itself right off after 30 minutes; I can fall asleep and not have to worry about shutting it off. I love that you can mix sounds and volumes to suit what mood you’re in. You can also save mixes. Brilliant!,Anxiety reliever
5,2018-08-10 05:49:16,"I think that this app is just perfect for people that like the calm sounds of nature. This app really calms me and helps me fall soundly asleep, I love that you are able to create your own cool sounds and save them. I also love that the app gives relaxation tips, so you can fall asleep better. I love this app and think that you should try it out, I am sure you’ll like it.❤️",So Amazing
5,2018-08-05 18:51:20,"I've created a series of meditation melodies for work and at home. I'm more focused at work, I fall asleep more quickly, and I'm able to soothe myself during stressful moments on the go. I have other meditation apps, but I prefer having the ability to construct my own melodies and the variety of sounds the app provides. It's definitely worth a download!!",I love this app!
5,2018-07-25 06:16:19,I really like this app. I downloaded it for my plane ride from California to South America. I was flying at night and need something extra to help relax me. This did the trick! I love the variety of sounds and the amount of control you have to blend the sounds. I’m a city girl who grow up camping every year. Being able to combine those sounds was soooo amazing!! And I greatly appreciated it 😍,Lovely
5,2018-07-19 04:58:18,"I am a teacher who also suffers from insomnia (bad mix).  However, this app creates such relaxing sounds that can be layered.  It makes it so realistic, and so relaxing.  I love the timer feature and all the choices in sounds you can combine to make your personal sounds that work best for you! A+ in my book and a must have!",Incredible for sleep and relaxation
5,2018-07-14 03:17:27,I use Relax Melodies day on nights that I cannot drift off to sleep. The voice is very relaxing and explains about sleeping and gives breathing samples to try and calm your mind.  Relax Melodies also has different or I should write very many sounds to help drown out other sounds around your house including any snoring sounds.  Thank you Relax Melodies for helping me rest and sleep.,Relaxing Sleep
4,2018-07-15 03:23:16,"Being someone who has a hard time falling asleep & staying asleep, I found Relax Melodies is the Best sleep app out there. They have so many sound choices & the option to play 2 or more sounds simultaneously. I'm currently obsessed with 'Eternity' and I swear as soon as i put it on I'm immediately at peace. I think there's a timer option too, but I keep the app on all night long🙂 I highly recommend this app!",The Best Sleep App!
5,2018-06-29 20:25:20,"I have suffered from insomnia for many years. Several years ago I discovered this little app. I won’t say it has cured my insomnia but it makes relaxing before bed MUCH easier. I also use this when my kids sleep so now, when I turn on our “sleepy music”, they have no trouble going to sleep and staying asleep.",Can’t sleep without it
5,2018-06-28 18:29:34,"I love this app. I use it while saying my prayers each morning to drown out the sounds of neighbors mowing their lawns, barking dogs, etc. Sometimes at night, I like to read while hubby watches tv. He listens to sports, while I listen to a distant rain storm. Love it. I even listen to the calming sounds in this app while in the car. I ride shotgun, so it keeps me calm during heavy traffic. 😊",Great Sounds
5,2018-06-28 03:13:29,"I love this app! I can hardly sleep without it. A plethora of sounds to choose from, nearly infinite soundscape possibilities. One minor problem: the app crashed a few times shortly after opening it, however this may have been fixed in a recent update, as it hasn't happened since. Overall, a great app, highly recommended.",Love this app!
5,2018-06-21 05:48:16,One of the best sleeping tools out there. I’ve used this app off and on for the past 6 years. It works so well. I love creating my own sleep melodies. All the water sounds are my favorite. I haven’t had any issues with this app. I love the meditations too. I’ve only tried the free version this time around but it’s so grand that I’m sure the extras must be too! Sleep tight!,A drug free deep sleep.
5,2018-06-11 05:02:52,I like the sounds on the app I wish some of the song sounds went longer before repeating but they are all great! My favorite combination is what I call the mountain coffee shop.  It consists of the toskana the crowd and the river. For me it paints a beautiful picture of a small log cabin coffee shop with the dull chatter of conversations and a small river flowing through a bright forest town. It is very peaceful!!!,I like it
5,2018-05-30 17:56:23,"I have a hard time sleeping in the day time, but sometimes I need to if I have a long night ahead of me, so I downloaded this app, and it works amazing. I just turn on some relaxing music or the mediation and right to sleep I am. I recommend this app over any other app. Most apps are expensive and don’t even work but this app is free and it works!",My experience
5,2018-05-30 02:37:37,"I really enjoy this app. It saves your groups of sounds each time, so you don’t have to constantly find them again each time, and there are a lot to choose from. I do wish that there were more/ and or cheaper meditation play lists. They are just way too expensive, although I’m thankful for the few free ones.",Great
5,2018-05-24 05:59:58,It relaxes me instantly and I use it anytime at night and even in the daytime when I need a quick nap. The Timer and the alarms are especially helpful. I also love the ability to easily mix features and save them. The only thing is I would love to get more sounds that are free ( such as the sound of a plane...) but all in all I give it 5 stars!,One of the best apps!!
5,2018-05-21 13:45:07,"#updated review *Although the free sounds are great, the premium sounds are greatly over priced.*            The best sleep ever! I love the sound of a summer night, with crickets and spring creepers. With all of the sound variations available in this app you can find the best relaxing sound for yourself. It has the whole spectrum of sounds from the ocean, to the day and night sounds of a forest.",Summer at Grandma's
5,2018-04-12 01:56:24,"I struggle with anxiety and this app has helped me immensely over the last couple of years. The gentle, methodical sounds help to calm me when I’m on the verge of an anxiety attack, and the sounds of rain falling softly help me fall asleep on otherwise sleepless nights. I love that I can create my own sound blends. A lovely mix of soft rain, thunder, and flute music in the background is my current favorite!",Perfect for me!
4,2018-05-20 04:19:25,I use this app every night. Couldn’t sleep w/o it nor would I want to try. Bluetooth it to speakers on my nightstand and listen until I’m lulled to sound sleep. I’m bipolar so sleep is a serious issue for me. This truly helps. Try it for yourself. Only wish it had a way to set it to stop at a particular time each day to keep me from oversleeping. It has an alarm feature but I’ve not gotten it to work yet. Still...,Great app.
5,2018-03-21 16:58:06,"I started using this app just two days ago, and can already feel a difference. I am in my seventh week of being in a full leg brace for a broken kneecap. I've been sleeping, or rather, trying to sleep, on the couch since then. The last two nights, using the sounds or sleep meditation, I have finally been comfortable. Well done!",Already a Winner!
5,2017-12-19 15:23:23,"I used this app almost every day I was pregnant because I had trouble falling asleep; due to being uncomfortable and sickness. It's been two years since the birth of our daughter and I STILL use it! For sleep, relaxation, and study. I highly recommend this app. So many sounds to choose from as singles and the best compilation mixes you can make or choose from.",GREAT FOR EVERYTHING!
3,2018-02-13 12:15:48,"...But it lags out my phone (6S) so bad, I’m not even able to switch apps, or shut it down, or even power down my phone until it stops doing whatever it is doing, which can take up to 10 seconds or more. That said, the amount of sounds included for free is awesome!  You can fall asleep to a different sound every night for 2 weeks and still not repeat a sound.  I really love this app—fix it please!!!  If you do, instant 5-stars!",Could be amazing!
4,2018-02-01 08:41:50,"Great app, helps me relax and sleep. Tons of features. Four stars instead of five because the lower ads block the bottom buttons. I can’t dismiss ad, and it’s blocking use of app. I don’t know what person ever clicks on these ads to begin with and how they even profit. So useless and annoying. WAY overpriced for ‘lifetime’ app. Even with discount I would never pay $20 for an app. Out of your minds. The best I’d pay is $6.99.",Ads block functions
5,2017-11-24 20:28:44,"This app is as simple or as complex as you want it to be. Works great for my wife and I, and our four month old. Sound quality is impressive as well, I downloaded 3 sound machine apps at the same time to try out, and I liked this one the best. My favorite part is that you can play your iTunes music over top of the sounds!",Well designed
5,2017-11-18 03:51:07,I can’t sleep when it’s “dead” quiet. One of the reasons is I suffer with mild tinnitus. The background sounds of this app help me sleep and “mask” the ringing of the ears that I suffer with. The variety of sounds is great and you can mix & match different sounds for even more variety. Play it through a Bluetooth device or earbuds when you travel. I recommend this app.,The way to relax
4,2017-11-23 19:41:27,It’s a great natural sound app for sleeping . I love that you can add as many sounds together that you like as well as control each sounds volume. The only problem that I had was that some of the blocks do not work for me. And it’s no the “pro” version that I’m taking about the regular blocks the 1st half of them work and the 2nd half do not.  after that then the Pro selection starts.,Some work some do not
5,2017-10-02 08:04:19,"I’ve been playing music all my life to help me relax and drift off to sleep.  This app will certainly help you with that. What I really like about this app is the number of “sounds” you can use to construct your own “recipe” to lull you off sleep, the ability to save this recipe as a “favorite” and finally how easy this app is to use. To paraphrase, don’t go to sleep without it!",Sleep Enhancer
4,2017-10-22 07:12:34,"I'm still quite new to this app (I have the free version), but the experience of having a few of its soothing sounds running together for just a few minutes, then hitting pause and having only the usual nighttime house sounds in my ears, is amazing.  It's as if Relaxing Melodies' sounds had tapped into exactly the right wavelength in my brain to calm me.    I'll update this review as I have more information to share.","So far, so good"
5,2017-08-12 00:42:22,"Just had my first baby, and this has been the best soothing sounds app I've found so far. A lot of apps force you to have the app open to hear the sounds, but I can use my phone, text, search etc, and the sounds are gently in the background for baby. They relax me too :) Also love the interface. Kudos to whoever came up with design. Love this app.",My review.
4,2017-09-26 22:43:03,"My toddler and I both enjoy the instrumental and nature sounds. We haven't really used the city sounds though. The sounds are on an undetectable loop, so I am not distracted by the sounds starting over. You can select any of the sounds to play together and even adjust the volume for each one individually. The only thing I would change is adding a little more variety to the free version. Enjoy!",Soothing sounds
5,2017-07-04 12:14:14,"At home I always sleep with an air purifier, so when I travel I find it hard to sleep. Some of the sounds are definitely better than others, but if you combine a few (my favorite are storm, windy trees, and oscillating fan) you can get a nice wide frequency white noise akin to an air purifier. Close enough that I am able to sleep well while traveling.",It works!
5,2017-06-12 22:13:52,"I know the app is partially for help sleeping, but I don't use it for that. I find it most useful when on crowded trains or at a coffee shop in public and I need good background noise to put on when I'm doing homework or reading. It gives a good list of sounds to choose for your mood. I highly recommend it for anyone that has trouble doing work in public.",Relaxing
5,2017-06-11 02:23:40,"This app is terrific! It's helped  to put my grandkids to bed as well as helped me get some really restful nights after a long day with the grandkids. There are so many different combinations, I was able to create an individual sound that works best for each of my grandkids as well as for myself. I highly recommend this app for every member of the family.",A great app!!
5,2023-11-02 15:07:14,This app is amazing. I’ve tried so many over the counter sleep aides. None come even close to the sleep that I have gotten using green noise the past few nights. It has been life changing. The commercials are spot on. It calms my racing mind down and what a change a good nights sleep makes! Thank you!,Yea!
5,2023-08-20 14:09:03,"Since beginning to use Better Sleep, I fall asleep faster every night. And I t’s helped me to get into a sleep schedule because I look forward to these meditations, relaxing sounds, and bedtime stories. I literally recommend this app to everyone I know who needs help falling asleep and/or relaxing.",I love this app
4,2023-10-11 14:25:45,"I’ve had the app for a week and while I love the sound and music selection, I don’t understand why the app will suddenly stop playing randomly, get rid of the set up I had with the sounds I liked the next day, or stay playing for the set time I set it for. The app would be a definite 10/10 if these issues were fixed.",So far so good. But…
5,2023-08-08 09:31:51,"I don’t pay for all the extra sounds (even though I bet they’re worth it if you really want to), BUT I use this every day to fall asleep. Great quality and calming sounds that last through the night. I’ve been using for over two years now…",Perfect for everyday use
5,2023-08-08 04:08:05,"My only complaint is that I wish the alarm were easier to get to and manage. Multiple alarms would also be greatly appreciated, rather than having to change a single one.  Other than that, I love all the sounds, the mixing element, and the organization of it.",Fantastic app
5,2023-08-02 05:13:32,"This app has helped me and my family sleep for YEARS. This app has many combinations so you can find the perfect one for you. Perfect for sleep, 10 star.

I am looking forward to my next meditation. Thank you again. ❤️",BetterSleep
5,2023-02-22 06:27:15,I’ve been using this app for awhile and I like the ability to mix and match the variety of sounds they have to create the mix that lulls me to sleep when I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back to sleep on my own. It hasn’t failed me yet!,Helps me fall asleep when I really need to.
5,2023-01-22 16:29:15,"This app is visually stunning. With a large selection of sleep sounds and guided meditations, you can’t go wrong!

4,2023-01-29 12:05:53,"Even though it cost😒 and I only got the things that are free, my first time listening to the bedtime music was soooooo relaxing and helped so much, it might cost but it’s legit and if you got the extra dollars for it or genuinely NEED it, then pay up! Cause other than headspace this is my go to when I’m having trouble with sleeping (which is Often) ... it’s just all around good!",Perfect.
5,2023-01-10 04:48:12,I have tried lots of applications and white noise and lots and lots of things to slow my mind and help me get to sleep. This worked so well i am even waking up less often during the night. I am so excited. Cant wait to try new stories and relaxing sounds. Highly reccomended.,Wow Really works
5,2023-01-05 05:36:11,It help me fall asleep faster made me have less stress and sleep for longer. I do a lot of sports and I’m used to getting up early to get to games so I used to wake up at 6:00 but know I wake up at 7:00 I know that it’s only a 1 hour difference but it’s still something. 😉,Better sleep actually helps
5,2022-12-26 15:44:20,Since using this app I’ve begin to sleep through the night and get up thoroughly rested I’m the morning. No more laying in bed for hours waiting for sleep to arrive. Now I look forward to sleep knowing that I’ll feel regenerated in the morning!,Didn’t know that better sleep was possible for me.
5,2022-12-06 08:10:46,"I haven’t been having good sleep due to finals so I was trying to find some white noise that can help me fall asleep and I came across BetterSleep, so far it’s been pretty good not just for sleeping but for mediating as well. Sometimes you just got to stop what you’re doing and have a few minutes to yourself.",It’s pretty cool
5,2022-09-24 13:39:02,"Better Sleep has a bit of a learning curve and it’s totally worth it. I enjoy the variety of sounds, the meditation aspect, all of it plus the ability to create my own mixes.

4,2022-11-12 03:42:51,"Since I’ve started using this app, my two year old son has been falling asleep at bedtime very quickly and I love that I’m able to layer and mix multiple sounds to customize my ambient experience. I just wish I could have more noises unlocked without having to pay for them, like hey you used our app for 30 days here’s 3 new sounds.",Wonderful
4,2022-11-11 04:16:05,"I like that I can make my own combinations of sounds.  I’m very picky about what I like to fall asleep to and I’ve only found apps that have premade sounds which don’t always help.

5,2022-09-24 03:57:34,Had an issue involving playing certain tracks. Resolved within hours on a Sunday after sending email. Was given clear instructions on how to fix and received follow up message to check that it all worked out. Unexpectedly fabulous support.,Great Customer Service
5,2022-06-20 02:03:01,This app helps my children and I sleep every night. We also benefit from it when we’re in a hotel or away on vacation.

There is the same melody, which the name of the melody is ‘infinity’. And in meditations, it’s the same thing. I still love the composer! :)",Great! But....

Also great to use for those that practice yoga or meditation. Best app!",Best App for to help me sleep or study

5,2020-08-07 02:03:53,This is the best app I’ve ever downloaded I’ve had problems with sleeping in the past this app has really helped me the only thing I would change is that I think there should be more bedtime stories and meditations for people who don’t have the membership but otherwise five stars!!😴😴,Seriously best app ever😄😄😄
5,2020-05-06 05:40:54,"I had been looking for soooo many apps that would help me sleep and they all needed money(But what app doesn’t). Although you have to pay for a premium or whatever, it’s still pretty good without it. A lot of choices and you can customize your sounds and stuff so it’s realllly great. Definitely one of the best.",Definitely worth a try

It has been this way for years and years, beyond me into the roots of my family tree that are strange and unfamiliar to us civilized folk.

1,2019-09-16 05:26:36,"I cannot believe this wonderful app is now charging me a yearly subscription to use every sound, even those that were previously free. I saw in other reviews that we are being recommended to email support if we are having this problem— I will not do this, because it is clear from the numerous reviews that this a widespread issue that has to be fixed by developers, not an individual error. I even uninstalled then reinstalled the app, and the problem persists. If this bug doesn’t get fixed soon, I will have to delete it. A real shame.",A once loyal user
1,2019-09-13 05:09:06,"I’m really sad that this app costs money now. I have been using it since 2014 and it has helped my sleep a lot. I’m not even considering paying for it since the company has a shady tactic of gaining thousands of good reviews from a FREE app and use it to their advantage to convince others that it’s amazing and they should buy it. Also, the company should at least own up to their lack of any free sounds because their generic reply’s to others insist that there’s a technical error which is not true so definitely would not give them my money; deleted and will never buy.",DO NOT UPDATE
5,2019-06-11 03:46:59,"I enjoy using the sounds for falling asleep when I’m away from home.  But lately I use it even more on airplanes to drown out loud talkers, fussy babies, or other noises that distract me from my work or reading.    I like being able to create a custom mix and the timer is also great.   Thanks for a relaxing app experience!",Very relaxing and helpful to drown out noise on airplanes
5,2019-04-23 06:47:13,"If you're into music and audio, you must have this app. Just for the fact that it can run in the background along with other apps. I usually have a music app (apple music, soundcloud, pandora, spotify,...etc) + this app + a game app (sound on) running at the same time.

Dedicated and Faithful Developers!! Love it!!!
5,2018-11-25 08:10:12,"I love this app. And it’s totally with it to get the premium version.

4,2018-11-02 05:02:36,"Hi!  To tell the truth, I stopped using Relax Melodies for a time in the last few months.  Its sounds sounded a little artificial.  In a quest for better sleep, I opened it and decided to use it a few nights ago.  I remembered the calmest sleep I’ve ever had, my vacation in London.  I turned on Urban Rainstorm and it certainly sounded like a heavy rain falling outside my window in the city.  I slept through the night so comforted!  I’m a frequent user now!  God bless you!",Bethany
4,2018-10-29 04:44:33,"It’s a variety of sound here for everyone, if your from the city and used to hearing it there is something for that if you just a small town person living in the city and you want something to remind you of home here it is!!!

5,2018-09-12 00:44:24,I have used this app for a very long time & it just keeps getting better. I love the variety of sounds & with the ad free version you get amazing guided meditations. My daughter loves this app too & I'll let her pick our sounds when I lay with her for her nap. I never have any bugs or glitches. Thank you for a great experience!,Premium Version worth every penny
5,2018-09-06 02:15:39,It’s so cool that you can mix sounds and adjust their volume individually to make your own mix. You can save it to your profile to find it again easily. I’m surprised this app is free! It’s awesome! It doesn’t drain your battery. There are A LOT of really good sound options. I am starting to use this app every night now since it helps me sleep so well.,Best!

5,2018-06-27 20:04:39,"This app is wonderful! It has many varieties of sounds just as it was nature itself. It allows me to sleep well while listening to soothing sounds of the rain.

5,2018-06-14 04:37:58,"A friend recommended this app to me when I mentioned having trouble sleeping. It has quickly become part of my pre-sleep routine, to select a sound and set the timer. The sounds are just ambient enough to lull my overwrought mind into relaxing and quieting down. And there is a great variety of sound as well. Highly recommended!",Perfect app for ambient sound
1,2018-06-14 10:46:30,"The white noise sound has a faint beeping sound when turned up, which is extremely annoying. I have heard it both on my phone and my wife’s phone. Another thing I don’t like is that some sounds are enabled to play, but you can’t actually play them. Then there are some that are disabled unless you upgrade. Why not just disable the ones that I can’t actually play? Doesn’t make any sense. I deleted the app and downloaded something a lot simpler, which is why I rate this one star. Don’t need to make something simple complicated.",Glitchy and weird sound
5,2018-06-08 12:08:42,I’ve used quite a few different relaxation apps before going to sleep. This one provides many many combinations of options of sounds that you can customize completely.

4,2018-06-10 19:02:07,"I love how easy it is to create your own layered sound mixes with this app. The free version has tons of sounds to choose from and you can really feel transported. My only negative to note is that the sounds are too loud, even when I adjust them down almost all the way. I end up turning my phone volume down but then I am nervous I won’t hear my alarm in the morning.",Really enjoying the app
5,2018-05-30 01:34:55,"Update: don’t like the newest version as well  I've been using the free version for a few years but recently decided to upgrade. It was great but now even better.

4,2018-06-08 05:19:30,"The updates are good-now you can control the volume in one place for multiple sounds. However, the sound mixes don’t save after you exit the app, even if you save them with a name. Also, the timer is more difficult to set than the older version.

5,2018-05-19 06:13:33,I have a constant ringing in my ears that makes it impossible for me to fall asleep in dead silence.  My doctor recommended I listen to something like white noise to drown it out.  The white noise wasn’t relaxing to me.  So I found this on the App Store.  I use the combination of the slow waves and river to envision myself relaxing on the water.  It seems to work for me. 😴,Can’t sleep without it
5,2018-05-17 14:14:35,"Having tinnitus, it is easier to sleep with ""noise"" in the background. Most plug in sound machines are limited to 5-6 sounds, have to pack them to travel and the switches wear out.

4,2018-05-18 07:54:00,"I’m loving this app and I just have the basic stuff. Lately the noise from outside has increased due to interstate construction and the dog ( and husband) snoring!  I really don’t need to play this extremely loud and I get pleasant, comforting sounds that lull you to sleep-we don’t even notice the noise in the room. Also love the fact that you can put sounds together for yourself and what works for the individual. Relaxed and loving it!",Relaxing
5,2018-05-15 08:25:33,I've tried quite a few & this is the best with not only the variety but having the option to have it fade off after a time you can designate.

Recently they added more things that you have to buy, which I am not too happy about, but at least a lot that I use is still free.

Can't say I use them all but they are an interesting collection.",Sanity keeper

3,2021-04-04 15:04:39,"This is an excellent app, but too much content is restricted to paid premium accounts. Premium accounts are prohibitively expensive. A small one-time fee would be reasonable, but a large recurring one is not. I love the sound mixer, which enables me to create my own mixes. I wish I could access more of the content. More than half of it is only for premium. Also, paid premium accounts are not supported by family sharing. It’s highway robbery.",Excellent but Restricted
4,2021-02-25 04:23:24,I love the sleep sounds this app offers.  However I would like to see more free meditations and stories available in the different categories.  There’s no way I’m purchasing the app based on the few audio choices available and I can’t preview what the others are like.

5,2020-05-26 16:36:22,Everything was great and I could play this as background to audiobooks so when the sleep timer turned off the book the sounds from your app would continue. Now when I start a book it immediately stops your app from working. 😔,Really useful but something happened
5,2020-04-05 05:11:28,I’ve been using this app for years. It helps end my day and nights when I’m extra anxious and have trouble sleeping or wake in the middle of the night it puts me right back to sleep.

5,2020-01-04 02:51:59,"This new update is perfect. I have always loved the app, would have given it 5 stars before. BUT NOW!!! It is even better. When I would get a call or an alarm would go off, the sounds would stop. With this update, when the notification is over it goes back to my sounds. Amazing. Use it everyday.",Love this update!!
5,2019-07-09 05:07:54,You can follow guided meditation or something else that you can create and save.  Data is interesting and it has many options for tools to personalize your favorite sounds.

2,2019-10-09 03:42:47,"Revising my previous review from 4 to 2 stars. I paid for the premium version years ago, but now whenever I try to sign in and access the premium features, I’m unable to do so without coughing up another $60. Unless the developers can fix the issue, I’d pass on this app.  _______________________________________  Lots of sounds and meditations to play with. I'd suggest a few improvements like fading the sounds more slowly when you set the clock to exit the app at night, as well as linking to outside sounds like ambient songs.",Was a good app
5,2019-06-26 12:56:27,"I’ve been using this app for years as my main noice maker! After showing to my family members we are now a family of relax melodies freaks!

5,2019-01-29 04:50:40,"We use sound machines at home but I downloaded this app just to try it once while traveling. It. Is. Awesome! Seriously the best. Runs all night, pick from an array of sounds- especially with small children who are used to white noise, this is a must! And I use it on work trips, makes hotel sleeping quiet and feels like home!",On par with any sound machine
5,2018-12-26 10:33:13,"I’ve used this app for over five years now and, as a person with ADHD, it’s been an important tool I use to cope with a very loud and distracting world. I use the noise for helping me to focus while reading, giving me something to Center in during meditation, and sounds to lull me to sleep without being so repetitive I get annoyed with them.",Using App for Five Years
5,2018-11-10 06:32:02,"Love, love, love this app! I’ve used it several times in my spa for white noise when it’s busy outside... works like a charm, the options seem endless and I’ve been impressed with the quality of the sound options. The meditations for sleeping are excellent too. I have been recommending it like crazy!",Wish I would have found this app sooner!!!
5,2018-11-07 08:21:57,"I have to say that I really love this app. I was really pleasantly surprised by how many sounds there are, despite not buying anything. With a lot of other apps like this you’re restricted to maybe 5 to 10 sounds, but this app, without buying anything, provides just about every sound you could want to go to sleep to 🤗",Impressed...
5,2018-10-24 16:23:26,"For the first time I decided to find help in getting to bed earlier and falling asleep as I have a difficult time falling asleep.

I will continue to use it as my mode of getting into a routine in getting to bed.",Trying it out for the first time
5,2018-10-20 10:57:25,"I have never slept so well. I love that the sounds keep playing in the background while using other apps. I play this while listening to adult bedtime stories. It is great that you. An customize and save your mixes, so you can just click and go without having to play around with it when you need to be sleeping. Love this app!!",Amazing
5,2018-10-12 20:53:58,My first time trying any sort of app like this and it is absolutely wonderful! I’ve had it for a couple of days and it has a nice variety and it’s set up so you can enjoy plenty of sounds without HAVING to buy stuff to enjoy it while also giving you a plentiful option for more sounds. I use this a lot,Relax Melodies
5,2018-10-12 07:50:13,"I have trouble falling asleep and am a light sleeper, but since I got this app I am able to fall asleep quicker and stay asleep during the night without waking up from random small sounds. I feel like I am able to turn off my brain and doze off much easier. I love it and use it every night!",Sleep through the night
5,2018-10-08 01:53:05,"Really enjoying Relax Melodies. It’s become a “before sleep” essential for me- and my kids! No other app offers so many sounds- and a decent bunch of free ones. Plus, even the quality of the sounds is better than other apps I’ve tried. You can make infinite combos and even save favorite ones. Very well done. Thank you!",Best I’ve found
5,2018-09-26 13:31:45,"I happened across this app and I didn’t know there were such a wide variety of soothing sounds. I use it every night to relax my mind and body so I can fall asleep quicker. What’s even more amazing you can play multiple sounds at once for a deeper, richer and calming experience. This is an app everybody should put in there phones. Love love love it.",Relax Melodies are so soothing
5,2018-09-11 04:00:05,When you download this app take the time to really learn how to use it. You can make almost any custom background sounds to help drown out the noises that keep you from falling asleep Even aside from using it to fall asleep if you've had a stressful day you will find listening to it helps you unwind. 5stars all the way,Helps me fall asleep
5,2018-09-01 04:20:45,We had our newborn photos and the photographer used a sound machine that worked like magic to get our newborn to sleep. When we got home we downloaded this app and have been using it nonstop for our baby! He is now three weeks old and will sleep for 2-3 full hours at a time of this is on. We are so grateful!,Baby Magic
5,2018-08-31 03:04:14,"Very soothing. Love how I can create my own music. You can adjust the levels/volume each sound is at to truly customize your music, and you can save them and make more.   I found it funny how I ended up creating something that sounds like background music from TES V: Skyrim. Duduk, River, Night, and Rain. Now it’s hard to stay awake when playing the game!!  😂",Amazing
5,2018-08-27 23:15:23,"The many sounds in this app are so relaxing. I love to listen to rain falling down and besides the sound of rainfall, there are many other sounds that work well to reduce my anxiety. I've been using this app for years.

5,2018-07-30 10:48:49,I can’t imagine anybody not liking this app. This app is a life saving for my family . My husband and kids can not fall to sleep without this and we keep it playing through the night till the morning. I loved it! There are different varieties of sound that might soothe you. And individual sound can be adjusted as well. Thumb up! 👍🏻,I’m addicted !
4,2018-07-31 07:47:29,"The app is absolutely amazing. All of the sounds are lovely and sound completely real, my only complaint is the fact you are limited in the sound mixes you can create and you have to spend a LOT of money to get all of the different sound pieces. Other than that this app is incredible and definitely worth a download.",Wish you had endless sound combinations
5,2018-07-25 03:08:06,"I've faithfully used this app for the past 2 years, maybe even 3 every single night. I have to have sound to sleep and this has lulled me and babies to sleep without fail. You cannot beat the selection of amazing sound and mixing option. My absolutely favorite and I have tried them all!",Best sound app out there!
5,2018-07-23 10:25:50,This app really works!  My favorite is a combination of the rains and thunderstorms. It reminds me of nights when I was little and would fall asleep to the rain outside. I’ve tried other sound machines but they just didn’t sound realistic. Plus the convenience of having this app on my phone is great!  I can take it anywhere.,Best app for falling asleep
4,2018-07-15 07:00:30,"I’ve used other meditation apps but the best part of this one is the flexibility. You can adjust the volume of each sound. In my other one, the ocean waves were too loud and you couldn’t hear the music. I am still trying different aspects of the app, and am enjoying it very much. I’d probably give 5 if I upgraded to pro. Seems like there’s a lot of cool aspects to it, still considering...",Loving it!
5,2018-06-21 15:09:18,"Started using this app with my first Granddaughter, which is 15 yrs old now. I also have a 5yr old and 1yr old twins. This app is tried and true. Every child I’ve used this on including friends children they generally settle down and are asleep within 3- 10 mins. I used the 10 minutes because my second grandchild is hyper and fights sleep.",Nana of 4
5,2018-06-18 21:43:28,"I love the variety of sounds in this app. Sounds of nature, many types of water sounds and instrumental too. Sounds can be adjusted individually for volume each time to create a different effect when playing the same elements. I love this app and so do my pups! I use this at home and also at work to de-stress towards the end of the day.",So many relaxing sounds
5,2018-06-06 04:37:38,"This app has been perfect for our family. Our son has used it to sleep for years, and my husband and I use it to sleep and even concentrate while working. There are options for everyone! I wish the paid version were a little more affordable. I'd upgrade if it were. But the free version is plenty.",Great app for all ages!
5,2018-06-05 01:32:23,"I love that this plays all night long! Doesn’t stop after a couple hours and ask if you’re still listening. I also love that you can choose different sounds to add and how loud each one is. I also like the other features including timers, reminders, meditation, a clock. So many cool features of this app!",Fantastic!
5,2018-06-04 04:06:42,"My toddlers cannot nap or sleep at night without this app. It has cut my effort in putting them to sleep in half. My son who is almost 3 specifically request the ""lady singing"" but it's really under humming lol. Great and I recommend any mom that struggles putting their child to sleep day or night yo download this app. It's amazing what a little music can do.",The best thing I ever downloaded
5,2018-05-25 20:35:58,"This app has saved me. I am an insomniac & can go 2-3 nights on no sleep & still be able to function, but once I found this app, I'm able to sleep most nights. Don't get me wrong, I do have an occasional night of no sleep but it's not more then one night. Oscillating Fan is my favorite.  Thank you Relax Melodies for making my sleepless nights less sleepless. 🙂",Awesome
5,2018-05-19 01:52:35,"I don’t usually write these but this app is worth it. I have the soothing sounds playing constantly, and I love that I can lay sounds on top of other tracks. I listen to Soft Waves every night to sleep, but I’ve always listened to Eternity, White Noise, and even Oscillating Fan. Tons of free tracks, great quality, and customizable. It often is a sensory oasis in the chaos of life.",The best way to chill out
5,2018-05-18 13:07:48,"I was looking for some nice natural sounds like the ocean and rain to help me relax and I came upon this app. Not only does it have exactly what I need and runs in the background perfectly when I'm using other apps, I really like that you can layer sounds on, like the ocean and birds, or rain and crickets! It anticipated more than I wanted and gave it to me. Two thumbs up!",Loving this app
5,2018-05-16 02:07:34,"Another app I tried had such harsh sounds but this one had soft, background sounds like I used to hear growing up. I love the way I can combine them and control the volume. Also, this app doesn't stop because of texts, notifications, etc like other apps I've tried. Very relaxing through the whole night.",Sleeping so relaxed now
4,2018-05-17 03:46:59,"I like this ap.  I set the timer and drift off to sleep with one of their pleasant sounds.  Only drawback is that it is expensive.  I only use the free version, as I can't justify the cost of the full version.  I checked out the prices a few months ago and decided to finally purchase, but when I clicked to buy, the price had increased dramatically.  That is why I gave it only 4 stars.",Use it regularly
5,2018-05-15 03:36:16,"I’ve been using this app for over 2 years. Probably much longer than that. Just about every night, I use this RM to get to sleep or even meditate. (I’m not really someone who meditates, but I did like trying out the free meditations available) I will continue to use this RM, seeing as I have not found anything comparable.",Over 2 years with this app
5,2018-04-12 10:03:42,"I debated giving the app a 3. I love this app but lately not so much. Most of the time I find I have to repeatedly download my sound each time I go to play it, sometimes it takes forever to download. There are a few other glitches that need fixing as well. Please update the app so I can change this to 5 stars!",Bring back my app!
5,2018-04-05 05:44:54,"Without this app I would be nothing. I was nothing until I recently discovered the sweet tunes that your late night lullabies had to offer me. I will never again sleep a restless night. The only complaint you will be hearing is from my future husband. I don't know who he is yet, but he probably won't enjoy inviting monk chants into the bedroom at night.",Gr888
4,2018-04-08 05:58:32,I really like the amount of sounds given even in the free version. Each sound has a volume control which is quite helpful in getting the right medley of sounds into a composition. I also like the timer option! Sounds too late into my sleep cycle tend to wake me up so the thirty minute time is great! I've only had the app for a couple of weeks but I enjoy it so far.,So far so good
5,2018-02-11 06:01:06,"I love Melodies. I’ve struggled with anxiety and insomnia most of my life and have tried more expensive apps, but with the vast options of sounds you can choose from and create your own custom  sounds it really makes falling asleep and staying sleep easier. With the lifetime purchase, I’m recommending this to everyone!","Great bargain, even better customization!"
5,2018-01-31 06:25:04,"I had brain surgery a year ago and it left me with a ringing in my left ear. I use a Bluetooth speaker at night in that ear and listen to this app each night to help me mask out my ringing. I can’t say thank you enough for putting together such a great app as this. I love how many options and choices I have now, it’s almost endless. Thank you again",Great relaxation
5,2018-01-24 19:12:45,This app alone has saved my sanity more than a handful of times. From car rides to nights at home... Being able to customize a tune for our little ones to fall asleep to has been a lifesaver!! It's awesome that we always have it with us and works like a charm. Getting ready to use it on our cranky little one now.,Best noise app
4,2018-01-26 04:48:09,Been using various apps for 6+ years for background sound/music for our kids.  This is by far the most comprehensive set of sounds and options that I’ve seen in an app of this sort.  The only thing I’d like to see changed is the ability to edit track selection/volume in an existing mix once it’s already been saved.,Great app for background sound!
5,2017-08-14 02:34:57,I love this app. It has helped me with sleep and meditation a lot. I have been looking for an app that will both give me variety of music and the choice of closing the app after a certain amount of time and this one is perfect for me. You can also set a bed time reminder which helps me a lot as well! Definitely recommend to download!,Great App
5,2017-08-04 04:16:34,I have a 2 year old that sometimes takes forever to fall asleep. One night when I was desperate I found this app and played the thunderstorm and rain sounds. OMG!!! Where has this been the last 2 years of my life. My child is sleep within 30 minutes when before it could take 2 HOURS. Love it Love it,Great sound machine
5,2017-06-27 20:54:06,"I love this app. It's perfect because I've had meditations before where I liked the voice or the music, but not both. With this, I can find my favorite meditations and combine with sounds or music to make it work for me. And the selection of sounds is wonderful. I use those in my headphones to help me to ignore distractions and stay focused. Definitely 5 stars!",From distress to de-stress
5,2017-06-10 07:33:09,I have been sing this app for a week now and it helps me to relax and fall asleep and stay asleep. I usually take forever to fall asleep and normally wake up several times during the night. I have found if I run the app all night long I don't wake up and get a much better quality of sleep. Highly recommend!,Very Calming
5,2017-06-10 04:09:44,"Works all night, even if the internet goes out. Drowns out distracting noises from night shift hubby. No audio ads 💜💜💜   Can also be used for meditation or white noise to concentrate during the day. Tons of great free options and even more for purchase. Doesn't interfere with my other apps. All in all, perfect as an app for this function!",Perfect for my needs
5,2017-06-07 16:57:21,"Great app for relaxing, cooling down at the gym and for getting to sleep after a busy day.  Soothing sounds mixed with rain, ocean and/or wind makes this the best sound app I have ever used!  Also love adding in the wind chimes!  So relaxing!!  My dogs calm down during storms when I turn the volume up and they hear the relaxing sounds.","Great for relaxing, getting to sleep and a super cool down at gym!"

5,2023-10-26 10:37:45,I love this app. I’ve used it for years and count on it during restless nights to send me off to sleep. It’s fun to pick your own combinations and they have a wide range of meditations to choose from.  Customer service is remarkably kind and quick to respond. I’m a lifelong fan.   Thank you Better Sleep.,The best
5,2023-08-06 04:01:34,"Wonderful sounds, very easy to blend and save. I have my favorites but play with the different sounds and blends shared by others. I’ve been using it for years now, I really like mixing the new color noise sounds with saved mixes. And the yoga Indra and river journey sleep hypnosis are my fav.","I use it just about nightly, and great meditation clips"
3,2023-08-10 12:36:27,"I love this sleep app and my whole family uses it but I have a few recommendations. 1. You should have a place to search different sounds instead of scrolling so much to find the one you’re looking for. 2. Everything is locked! That’s not fair. 3. It’s so hard to find what you want, there should be a test to find your type of sounds or meditation exercises.",Three things you should add
5,2023-04-27 09:45:45,Used to work great but now every time I start it then lock my phone and put in the charger it stops and crashes.

5,2022-09-28 08:46:21,I’ve been subscribing for two years and use the app every night. They’re always adding new content. They have a good selection of stories and meditations.

2,2023-02-03 01:24:49,"Update: app support got back to me very quickly. Thankfully Apple refunded my money. I updated to two stars because of the quick resolution. If I could, I’d give the app 2.5 stars. The free sounds are okay. They help if I want to take a quick nap. For me though, they aren’t good for all night. (I only tried the sounds, so I can’t attest to any of the other features.)  I liked the app until I signed up for a 7 day free trial, and it charged me for the full year the first day of the trial!!",Free trial is NOT free!
3,2023-01-23 08:34:53,"It seems like a pretty well laid out app. I only wish that more of the features were unlocked for the trial period.   Years ago you could find many apps in the App Store that had similar sounds for free, but most of them have either gone the way of the DoDo bird or they have monetized.   I like how full-featured this app is. I just wish I knew more about what I was getting before I had to subscribe.","So far, so good."
4,2022-12-03 08:27:18,I have troubles sleeping. I have sleep apnea. I have to wear a very annoying oxygen sleep mask! Well this app works very well to help relax me before I go to bed and to help go asleep! The only thing I don’t like about this app is that they make you pay for the best relaxing white noises. I would give it 5 stars if they would let all the white noises be free but I guess they need to make $$$$.,Best sleep relax app!

(not a nice way to say good morning)  the whole reason why I had gotten this app was because the iPad had discontinued THIER alarm settings as well!   It might have not of been popular, but it was EXTREMELY useful. And I believe it’s apart of a healthy sleep schedule that this app is supposed to help with.   Overall great app, but with this new update, I’m sad to move on..😔",Please
4,2022-04-13 17:52:34,"Hi, I think this app is really well laid out. It also has really good sounds. The reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are only a tint selection of free sounds.

Gives an uneasy  feeling of legitimacy. Please send an email when cancellation occurs. Waiting 2 days for verification. Update: I appreciate the response from the developer. Assured no worries.

If I am going to have to pay 60-40 dollars for 99% of the things on here I don't get why we don't have to pay for the app instead of paying for most things on the app. I know there is a free trial and you think that I am going to want to buy it after 7 days, but I am not going to pay $60 just so I can listen to music to calm myself down.",Not Very Satisfied
3,2020-11-23 07:42:33,"I have always loved this app. While I’ve never paid for a full subscription, I like that I can still listen to certain sounds. However, just a few days ago I was able to listen to certain sounds like the rain, river, and wind but today it is locked. It seems like the free selection has gotten smaller in a short amount of time and that made me sad... still love the app though but I am looking for a different app now.",Relax
5,2020-08-28 04:23:22,"I have been using this app for years to sleep better.  Today the sound stops after about 1 minute although it shows as playing. I turned off bluetooth, rebooted the iphone, and reinstalled the app.  It still stops playing sfter about 1 minute.  How can this be fixed?  Thank you.",Great App but Stops Abruptly
5,2019-11-28 07:06:33,I have had this app for over four years now and every time I use it I fall asleep very quickly it is very easy to take with me wherever I go because it is on my phone very easy to get the sounds and meditations I like And they are constantly making wonderful updates I love this app thank you so much for it,Best app ever for sleep
5,2019-11-22 06:39:07,"I have had sleep issues for a long time and have chosen the non-medicinal route. Problem is, nothing has worked until this! The free version is awesome! So customizable and realistic! The sounds are legit and range from soothing to city sounds. Highly recommend this app if you need help sleeping.",Where has this been my whole life?
5,2019-05-13 08:27:47,"So many different options to choose from, no advertisements, and no constant ads popping up insisting that you get the premium version of it which is great. Love the adjustments you can make to each sound and make it your own, overall it’s a very useful app and I suggest that everyone gives it a try!",Love it!
5,2019-01-04 09:04:40,"This app is the best I’ve found for my personal use. As a BehavioralMedicine specialist with over 30 years of experience, I get irritated with apps that have poorly trained individuals reading scripts or require me to be on headphones. This app gives me maximum freedom. I can use it as a primary meditation aid or as a background to create a calming environment. I highly recommend.","Best for General Relaxation, Meditation"
5,2018-12-12 12:45:48,"Great soundscapes that the user can combine in all kinds of ways. Once you’ve created or simply found a favorite mix, you can save it for quick replay. Far less expensive that most other apps of this kind , so it is somewhat limited (but not too much). Still, this a great light app! Thank you!",Wonderful and affordable!
5,2018-11-28 06:46:40,So thankful I don’t have to lookup  long videos of relaxing music only to find that they’re still too stimulating for me to fall asleep to. This lets you customize your own track and it doesn’t automatically stop. I’ve fallen asleep and the next morning the music is still playing. This is awesome so glad I found this app.,Amazing
5,2018-11-21 02:42:49,"I’ve been using the sleep meditations for over a year and now you’re taking them unless I pay $100+?! That’s ridiculous. If I’ve already purchased something, how can you take it away? I’m mad about this.  Thank you for helping me. I love this app and use every single day. So imagine my frustration. Sorry for the confusion.",Best meditation app.
5,2018-10-29 02:51:47,"I’ve used a lot of sleepy-time apps, some free, and others with a small fee. I like that it’s easy, has lots of relaxing options, and I can rely on the timer and alarm clock right inside the app. The sounds are authentic, and don’t sound like cheap synthetic music, and I can make my own combo of sounds.","Easy app, great sounds, timer works perfectly"
5,2018-10-26 06:31:59,"I have used and LOVED Relax Melodies for years. I love how I can make my own melody mixes and then save them so I can go back to them whenever I need them. I have 4 mixes that I use on a daily basis for multiple situations (study melody, sleep melody, chill out melody, cleaning melody). It’s great to just have on in the background and it truly does relax you. I highly recommend you get Relax Melodies!!",THE GREATEST APP FOR RELAXING
5,2018-10-25 04:21:50,I use this app every night. I like that you can pick the sound and layer them even the volumes of each sound. They also have meditation options you can choose. I’m out like a light with this app. My son is 4 and he also likes it if he’s a little anxious to go to sleep he calms right down to the ocean sounds. We love it!,Best sleeping app known to man.
5,2018-10-17 01:59:51,"This app is amazing! I can make my very own tune, and even if my phone turns off, the tune still plays! I sleep really good with this app. I recommend it to someone who has trouble sleeping and has earbuds!

4,2018-10-23 02:40:02,"I love that I can personalize and save whatever melodies or sound mixes that I make. It's super easy and user friendly. The only criticism I have is that the majority of sounds you have to buy. And I get that they have to make money somehow, it's just frustrating because there are only so many versions of a thunderstorm someone can listen to... all in all a cool app that I'll continue to use.",Personalized
5,2018-10-02 13:06:08,"My tinnitus (ringing in the ears) has gotten so loud that I have been having issues sleeping, among other things.   This sound generator is a life saver. I can pick the different sounds that drown out the EEEEEEEEEEEE so I can sleep. I’ll put it on in headphones during the day when it gets to loud.   This app is a GODSENT for those of us suffering from Tinnitus. Thanks to the developers of this one, thanks for the relief.",Great
5,2018-09-26 20:57:57,"This app is great on many levels; I like how interactive it is, to customize all the sounds to make each combination unique.  It really prevents the sounds from getting played out.  I also like the equalizer/mixing function.  I only have the free version, but even the free version has a lot of options.  Recommended!",Really like this app for naps
5,2018-09-19 18:50:02,Honestly super happy with this app. Downloaded it cuz Gary Vee mentioned it on his show and decided to try it when i was super stressed out and needed to block everything out. I was very happy with the quality of the audio recordings of every sound and the ability to combine sounds to create an “environment” to listen to. It helped relax me so much. Amazing app,Honestly the best
5,2018-09-17 06:01:06,"This app has been so helpful when falling asleep. I live in the city and it is a great way to get some relaxing white noise to help fall asleep. I leave it on for a few hours and have found that I am waking up less and getting a deeper, better sleep. It is super user friendly and such a great choice, especially for free! I LOVE everything about this app!",Love!!
5,2018-08-26 04:04:22,"I have this on almost every night to help me fall asleep faster. And, it helps me relieve myself and a few of my family members from the stress of the day. I’m glad I downloaded this app for a great couple of reasons. But, the major one is that it helps me find peace at the end of the day so I can relax and enjoy myself and my family.",Great app to help you relax!
5,2018-08-22 04:48:32,"this app actually really helps me fall asleep every night and the different combinations is super helpful because not everyone likes the same noises. also- being able to adjust the volume of each sound individually is super helpful. (also- even if you don’t get the premium like me, it’s a great app and has great sounds for sleeping)",GREAT APP!!
5,2018-08-21 02:37:42,"Love it.  100% worth paying for lifetime full access.  The app provides different guided meditations for different moods you may be in, and you can also control the background sounds.  There's like 60 different soothing sounds you can combine as background, or even just play by themselves if you don't want to do guided meditation.  The best!!",Best meditation app ever!!
5,2018-08-19 02:56:25,"With the recent update they included a meditating voice which I wouldn't have bothered with but since it came with the upgrade I tried it out...it's soo very helpful!! She helps me focus my thoughts It really had helped me out, thanks!! As for the other sounds they are hands down amazing!! I love this app (at times a lifesaver) Keep up the great work;)",Such a soothing app
5,2018-08-13 04:08:20,I've slept with white noise since I was a kid. I use this app all the time whether it's to block out the noise of the TV in the bedroom or my husband's snoring. I use it when there's too much background noise going on and I have to concentrate or when I need to sleep and don't have a fan. I love the choices and how you can mix and match as many as you'd like.,Love it.
5,2018-08-12 22:57:12,I have been using this app for several years now and have loved it. They recently changed it and i was unable to access the meditations I used to love. When i contacted them they showed me how to access them again. And now I am happy all over again. And there are many new meditations to explore as well. I love this app!,Excellent
5,2018-08-12 02:09:02,I love this app and so does my 5 year old. We use it for vacations and sometimes at home. The fan and butterfly together help him fall asleep:) I love all the options and how you can combine different ones. You don’t have to have WiFi which has been great:) I’ve tried other apps of this kind and this is by far my go to!,Great app for all ages
5,2018-08-06 14:11:16,Your melodies are amazingly beautiful as well as calming they put me to sleep every night I love them so much and they are puuurfect like the purring cat sound. I use relaxing melodies every day to get up in the morning 🌝and to go to bed🌚 I even listen to them when I take showers. It is kind of like a hipmitizer. And once again I love relaxing melodies so so so much😋🤩😇,Calm notes
5,2018-08-04 03:02:20,I don’t usually do reviews but this app is worth it.  It’s my favorite app.  I use it everyday to either calm myself or to set a mood.  Most apps only have a few sounds but this one has a lot to choose from & they all sound pretty genuine.  The fact that it’s very user friendly & doesn’t glitch isn’t bad either.  😏,"Honestly, a great app."
5,2018-07-30 05:08:22,Choosing my personal sound or combination of sounds makes this truly relaxing. I love the sound the keepers make at night and pair it up with other sounds is the perfect way to destress. There are so many sounds to choose from. Busy city sounds or the forest or ocean sounds and a variety of musical sounds as well. You can’t ho wrong!,Truly relaxing
4,2018-08-01 02:29:21,I think that there should be one that can get ANYONE to sleep and after like20 minutes it should stop if you haven’t touched it because I was sleeping at a sleepover and I was trying to get to sleep so I turned the rain on and fell asleep and I forgot to turn it off so it was on all night until my phone died and it wouldn’t work when I charged it so I had to restart it,Like it but..
5,2018-07-13 18:55:33,I love to be able to listen to the sounds available while I sleep since I have issues sleeping during the day. Being able to create a thunderstorm with heavy rain or wind chimes has helped me sleep. Love it! Saving melodies that you’ve created yourself and being able to listen to them again is a huge plus.,Awesome app
5,2018-07-12 10:00:40,"There’s many sounds to choose from and I love all the water varieties. My favorite feature though would have to be the timer, no more having to worry about my phone playing sounds all night long! I can decide how long it plays then automatically shuts off. Definitely recommend👌🏻",I love this app!!!!
5,2018-06-28 05:56:28,My mom introduced me to this app. I didn’t want to go buy a sound machine that would just take up more space on my nightstand. I am very pleased. I have been able to fall asleep quickly ever since I started using this app. I made a custom combo that relaxes me. I love how you can adjust the different sounds to you liking.,Great app for sleep or relaxation.

5,2018-06-19 02:36:21,I have had this app over a year now and I use it almost every night to help me fall asleep. I love the variety of sounds and how I can choose multiple sounds at once. I also love that there is a sleep timer because some apps wake me up in the middle of the night after I have fallen asleep. This app is by far my favorite!,Best sleep app!
5,2018-06-14 05:48:17,"This is the perfect app for sooo many times! Whether quiet time, meditation, sleeping or just peaceful sound, this app is used by everyone in the family.

5,2018-06-08 03:41:33,Very nice pleasant sounds to listen to and relax.  There are so many to pick from that no matter what I’m feeling I will find something to fit.  I also really like that I can listen one at a time or a combination to customize it to me.  My kids request it too for those hard to fall asleep nights.  Awesome travel buddy on my phone for camping or hotels.,Peace
5,2018-06-07 05:08:29,"This app was suggested to me by a church member. I like to play some instrumental worship and worship music that create an atmosphere no matter where I am. As I added these sounds with the music, it’s has become an amazing combination of relaxation and peacefulness because of this app with the right choice of music. This app allows you to create whatever atmosphere you desire. Try it!",Great Soaking Music App
5,2018-06-04 09:00:24,I loved this app before It's latest update now I really love it. Before there were tons of sound clips great to relax you. I even used them to calm a screaming toddler down. Now with the update they have all the sound clips from before plus meditation clips. When I can't sleep I put one on and it puts me right to sleep. Just the medicine I asked for.,Great App
5,2018-06-03 04:42:38,Oml!!!! I love this app. It’s very easy to use and has great sounds to choose from.

You also have the choice of the level of each sound as you layer them.  I like the timer feature- you can set it to turn off after a while. I also use it to remind me to go to bed.  Great app! 👍,Handy!
5,2018-05-31 03:54:30,Update** i love the new update and it's been like 3 4 years still use this app and love it very much!!!

5,2018-05-28 04:14:02,"I had major anxiety when I started a new job and could not fall asleep. And if I did sleep, it was interrupted.

Thank you!",Really works
5,2018-05-27 03:32:05,The thing I love about this app is the variety of sounds that you can add with any other sounds to make something custom to your tastes.

4,2018-05-21 02:46:35,"Overall the app is very good. It’s very relaxing and helps me get to sleep very easily. My only problem is, is that from time to time the app will cut out and I have to go back in reset my sounds and start the timer again. This is the only issue I have and like I said the app overall is really good. I’d recommend this to anyone who wants a sleep machine but doesn’t want to pay the price!!😀😀",Very good but…
5,2018-05-13 05:56:37,"There’s a lot of variety on this app. I mainly listen to all the rain type sounds. And I mix in the relaxation sound beats. It’s helped me fall asleep quicker and sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night to toss and turn, it again puts me instantly back to sleep. I also like to listen to it when I’m studying or just want to relax/de-stress",Pretty good

5,2017-12-13 04:59:22,I purchased this app last week when our power went out and my husband needs white noise to sleep.

Worth the money and that I can keep sound combinations I enjoy and make new ones when I want something different.,Study and sleep helper
5,2017-12-01 09:33:43,"This is hands down one of the best sleep sounds app I’ve downloaded. So many sound options for you to mix together, or pre-mixed sounds for you to choose from.

2,2023-09-16 04:42:30,"I love this app, and it helps me sleep during some nights. HOWEVER, one suggestion in order for me and other customers to use a lot more would be to have more free sounds to listen to without the lock symbol.

I am always looking for new ones!!",Would love to have lower pitch music
5,2021-08-24 02:04:22,I say 5 stars because of course it helps you go to bed but it takes a while and most of the songs and the sounds are for VIP or you have to pay for them and I just want to sleep so that’s why I would give it a nine out of 10.,9/10 but overall 5 stars

Imagine my surprise when I went to use it today and realized that all of my mixes we’re gone and I was told that my lifetime membership was no longer valid. It is asking me to pay more money after I already bought a lifetime membership when I Purchased the app. I hardly ever spend money on apps and this is one of the times when I thought the app was really worth it.

4,2018-07-18 11:50:52,"Best app for creating nice little looping ambient soundscapse. The loops are seamless. The options are fun and easy to use. My main complaint is the subscription method of obtaining all the sounds. But I guess ongoing support is needed. I just don't need another subscription in my life. 🤷🏻‍♀️ That said... Enough sounds are available that if you're into this kind of thing, it's worth it. And there are plenty available in free and basic.",Nice

4,2018-06-10 06:34:19,This is app is amazing. I love how you can mix up different sounds and levels of how much you want that sound to be in your mix.

I check how far it is, and it has 10-20 minutes left. I will get up, and it will play again— This is pretty creepy. I don't like it, fix this plzzzzzzzz. But I love this app otherwise! Byee!","I LOVE THIS APP, But something scary happened… READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING 😦"
5,2023-03-10 04:16:15,"I honestly love this app. I’ll keep the review short though. Helped me fall asleep way faster than normal. It also stopped me from having my TV on overnight! If you get this app, I highly recommend you try a few of the free rain sounds. They are the most peaceful in my opinion!",Genuinely Peaceful
1,2023-01-15 07:34:47,I’ve been using this app for two years now. I have bad anxiety and it was the only thing that could help me rest. I get nervous playing meditation music etc because idk if some weird sounds going to happen.   Well tonight my 9 year old son couldn’t sleep and I let him use the app thinking it would help. We used the Toskana setting alone with the flute and as we’re about to doze off there’s a very scary noise in it. I’m so mad that you have allowed this to happen. I won’t be using this anymore,What the heck is that noise

4,2022-12-03 23:56:56,"I really love this app, I’ve had it forever!! But the past couple weeks, every time I start playing white noise to sleep, the app closes itself and stops playing. I’ve been checking in periodically to see if this changes, but it still isn’t working. I’d really like to use it again tho if this is fixed",Bug fix pls!!
5,2022-10-27 00:45:06,I’ve only been using this app for a few days but I’m definitely impressed! There are so many sound options! You can even customize your sounds and add effects for things like focus/ better memory/ deeper sleep with a few taps and drags!!,Sooo many options
5,2022-10-06 12:06:31,"This is just very calming to listen to. I can’t fall asleep with noises so I really liked the timer feature because they make me sleepy, but as soon as I move to turn them off I’m awake, so just being able to have them slowly fade off on their own was vey relaxing.",Quality app
5,2022-08-22 07:16:20,"Immediately fell in love with this. So much to offer in terms of sleep aid, stress relief, focus, etc. The amount of sounds as well as quality, the ability to combine and fine tune your own “sound list” is absolutely phenomenal. Definitely worth the subscription. Thank you for this!",Worth it
4,2022-10-05 05:57:32,"There's so many uses for this app (sleep, anxiety, relaxing, etc) that I didn't know existed. The ability to search specific things could be better. There's also been issues with infinite play when using it as white noise after stories are done. Overall the app is good, maybe not worth full price.",Very Helpful
5,2022-06-02 13:16:42,"A friend recommended the app. Like me, she has trouble staying asleep and wakes often through the night. The sounds and story are so peaceful. I was excited to try the record feature, and the next morning I was surprised! I had to apologize to my husband, because I actually snore (I prefer the term dreaming in bear cub)!",Awesome app!
3,2022-06-04 01:42:46,"Yeah. Good app though, just wish there was a slightly bigger selection for the free users. I understand how they have to make money but with as many things as there are to choose from, you’d think the free users would have just a few more options. Barely any choices for meditation if you’re not paying. But it does help me sleep and relax so yeah, not all terrible",I wrote this review to get free sounds
5,2022-04-11 02:14:28,"I use this app to mask noise when I’m staying in a hotel. But it was also great to cancel the noise at night of squirrels in our attic while we waited for animal control to come get them out. Love it!!

5,2021-08-17 15:45:08,I suffer from severe anxiety so sometimes I stay up because my heart won’t stop racing. When I put on the city ambience+rain sounds it helps me fall asleep much faster.

I can’t seem to fix it or figure out why it happens. Some nights it plays all Night and other nights it shuts off repeatedly throughout the night. I had to delete it and try something else.

No refund, no response, don’t buy this product and don’t do a trial unless you’re sure.  They’re tone deaf so you may be you’re wasting your money.

4,2020-04-13 08:50:02,4 stars because of the premium I think that they should have more things to see of the premium. For e.g: The ASMR they should have like 5-10 sounds for us so listed to even if where not premium or don’t want to pay. For the story’s they should have more than just two. Like one of each category and if there realizing a part two then they put that in the premium.,Great app !
5,2019-07-22 21:58:36,I’ve used the different sounds available for different sleep needs. The white noise is always good to cancel out other small noises from other rooms in the house.

I would absolutely recommend this!!",Great!!
4,2019-05-22 06:23:27,"I switched to this app because my paid pink noise app didn’t have a new OS version but I am glad I found this gem.  I am particularly sensitive to repetitive noises that often occur in white noise apps (due to looping) but was able to come up with a good mix that wasn’t annoying and lets me block out the world, even with the free version.  I do wish they’d let you preview the pro sounds.","Great variety, love mixing"
5,2018-11-09 05:24:08,I found this app when I was trying to find a way to drown out my ex's horrible snoring. Now I use it anytime I have trouble falling asleep.

5,2023-10-07 11:18:28,I like to use the Better Sleep app when I can’t get my mind to slow down. The sound mix I created helps me to block out mental distractions and focus my mind inward. I create a visual scene of a night walk in a forest beside the ocean. I learned that scene from one of the mediation exercises in the app. It works!,Soothing sounds
5,2023-09-28 21:22:03,I’ve used this app more often than I thought. At night when I’m sleeping to help stay relaxed since I have trouble sleeping most nights. To when I’m reading and just need something to help focus or just keep me relaxed. Defiantly recommend to other people,Enjoying this app
5,2023-09-19 07:28:35,"This one easily beats all comparable apps, hands down!!! It will definitely get you to sleep and stay asleep. Also helps me to relax when I am awake.

5,2023-09-12 01:13:11,"This has helped me with my anxiety so much along with my ptsd I put this on & it helps my brain to just stop reminding me of traumatic experiences, I feel like I can breathe better I’m able to just relax in peace when this happens. I have severe ptsd & anxiety & I’m thankful I found something that gives my mind a break.",Great
5,2023-09-03 13:06:32,This allows you to customize layers of sounds and create your own special experience.  It has timers and alarms to turn on and off the mix of your choice.  It it very functional and I have used it for over a year while traveling and at home.,Amazing and Useful
5,2023-08-25 05:04:24,"I’ve been using this app every night since February 2020, and it has drastically improved the quality of my sleep. I used to never be able to sleep on planes either, but now, I just pop on one of my favorite mixes, and I’m out. I love this app!",The only way I can sleep now
1,2023-08-01 16:42:40,"I opened up my app today and an offer popped up for a year subscription for $0.00. I checked my email and saw a fraud notification from my bank asking if I authorized apple for a $43 charge. I checked my subscription account and lo and behold, better sleep charged me the full price for a year subscription. I have requested a refund and plan or reporting this as a fraudulent charge. Had my bank not sent me that email, I would have never even thought to look and see if I was charged.",Deceptive marketing
5,2023-07-26 14:43:27,I’ve always had trouble with sleep! With this app I sleep better. It is not guaranteed that you will sleep perfectly but with this app I sleep so much better than I ever have. I’m grateful for it and don’t even try to sleep without turning on my mix in the app. You have to try it!,Sleep Is Real
5,2023-01-31 00:53:34,I love this app! I’ve only been using it for a few nights so far but it helped me get some of the best sleep I’ve had lately. I especially love that you can create custom mixes of different sounds and music to create your own personalized relaxation experience.,Best sleep app I’ve tried
1,2023-07-26 01:39:16,"I downloaded the free app a couple of years ago and, for that entire time, listen to one free melody that I made. Almost everything else one has to purchase so I stayed with my free melody. A few months ago I noticed a $30 charge on Apple for this app that I never made. Apple couldn’t help me since I noticed the charge a little too late. I couldn’t find a way to contact the sleep app so I’m stuck with that charge and feel scammed. It’s unsettling to think that this can happen.",App charged me when I did NOT buy this app.
5,2023-01-27 06:33:46,"In creating your own soothing sound mixes. Never seen another sleep/sound app do it quite like this. Beautiful interface, too. I slept better than I have for months when I listened to this at bedtime instead of watching Netflix last night",Great versatility
5,2023-01-10 05:34:23,Helps drown out allot of different unwanted sounds at the most silent part of the day the quiet time can sometimes get almost unmanageable I’ve been trying this app past few nights and it helps tone down some noise and drowned out others thank you,Calming relaxing
5,2022-10-20 03:19:13,I only have the basic version so far but really enjoying it! I have never been one to care for sleep sounds really until maybe the last year or less. As a mom of three I do think when I use it it helps me restore soundly.,Worth trying
4,2022-12-09 06:11:20,I’m still trying to decide if I like the idea of playing a sound while trying to sleep at night. I’ve been searching for an app with free access to sounds but  haven’t been able to find much until discovering this! So far so good! Excited to see what I discover through this app!,Access to sounds!
4,2022-11-20 19:52:52,I have had this app for just less than a week and I’ve already referred it to some of my clients. I am a therapist and I can see value in using this app for all ages. I particularly like the bedtime stories.I also like the fact that you can change the different Nature Sounds and add different layers to the background music.,Better Sleep
5,2022-10-17 01:04:49,"I have been using this app to fall asleep every night for many months now, some night I use the meditation, and others I just use my personalized sounds. All without having a membership! I love how this app is still useable without needing a membership, this app is amazing!",I love this app!!
5,2022-10-16 03:19:33,I really enjoy the variety of sounds. So surprised by some of the stuff too. Being able to mix whatever sound you want and change the individual volumes is a lot of fun. The mediation’s really work well too. This app definitely helps me sleep at night.,Great!
5,2022-09-22 05:40:38,I don’t even need all the other sounds and noises because a majority of them put me to sleep straight away and it is very nice and smooth. I love how you can make your own mixes and sounds. Love this app can’t wait to see what they do next and i am very excited about it.,One of The Best Sleep Apps Ever
5,2022-09-07 16:23:10,"All parts of this app help me to relax but I especially love all the sounds. I also love that I can add them in any combination I want.

Thank you Better Sleep!",Love the sounds!
5,2022-09-02 02:11:58,Just started using this app and I love it. Love all the choices for the sounds and the ability to make my own sleep playlists. Also love the sleep tracker feature. Looking forward to playing with this more and getting more restful sleep!,So many choices

5,2022-05-25 02:20:16,"A good sleep sound provider, still lots of sounds locked. But they allow enough sounds that are unlocked without you having to pay any sort of subscription. Plus you can mix sounds freely. Would recommend.",One of the best sleep apps
4,2022-08-31 04:02:44,"I have only had this app for less than a week and truly  enjoy the meditation, sounds and the audio books. I especially like every thing is timed and goes off automatically. Could possibly tell you more but have not had time to explore all of the benefits.  Developers keep up  work!",Enjoy this app
2,2022-05-29 06:03:53,I found it difficult to use for several reasons After recording one nights sleep the noises sounds of sleep were not in chronological order or any type of order. Just all kinds of different sounds without any order made it cumbersome to navigate.  2 after i closed the app i went back to look at the recorded sleep again and the recordings were gone no where to be seen.  Cant recommend,Difficult
5,2022-04-06 03:02:15,"When my horrible tinnitus started, I did not sleep at all. The rain mix I made to play on my Bluetooth speaker all night was the only thing that helped.

4,2022-03-10 02:32:51,So this is actually pretty relaxing and I personally love the starship28 part 1 but tbh it would be nice if you could maybe have the rest of the story’s unlocked for free? Like I really wanna try something new but other than that it’s a good app thanks for reading and have a great time :)   P.s: I’ll change it to 5 stars once that has been taken care of,It’s pretty cool
5,2022-02-16 11:08:47,"After trying multiple relaxation apps, I’ve settled on this as my go to program. The variety of sounds and combinations allow for a selection to fit all of your needs and situations. No hard sell add ons or advertisements either. Definitely give this one a try.",Re-lax-ing
5,2022-02-11 02:32:03,"I like how you can fall asleep easily, and that it keeps track of your sleep. Don’t like how most of the noises are locked and you have to buy a thing monthly just to have that stuff, but other than that it’s pretty good and I also really like how the stories are told.",Very good
5,2022-01-12 21:21:48,Seems to work well but i find the user interface confusing and have not been able to figure out how to use it for the best benefit. I will keep trying though :-) I do not have the paid version which i imagine is more user friendly,Great idea
5,2021-11-12 18:05:37,"I’ve had a hard time relaxing music/sound that work for me because there would always be some sort of sound mixed in that triggered auditory sensitivity (piano, humming, etc) with this app I could make my own mix of sound s that felt calming to ME. It’s a great app",Great for people with auditory sensitivities
5,2021-10-15 19:19:28,"I used this app originally for myself for some different background sounds to fall asleep and to just relax. Now I use this app ever since I had my babies. So many varieties of sounds and it's not on a timer, so it can go all night to help them sleep. Love it!!",Great background variations for sleep!
5,2021-08-17 16:17:52,"I was super tired and accidentally purchased a year subscription. Honestly, do not regret at all!! I love using the meditations to go to sleep and affirmation to wake up. Plus, mixing all the sounds together is both fun and pleasant. :) I hope they keep adding new content.",Bought a year by accident- no regrets!
5,2021-07-08 02:32:56,"Relax Melodies really works for me, since I have a really hard time sleeping. After I got this, I’d make my own sounds, and usually I’ll base it on nature. It really works and it has a million different things to help you, so I’d recommend this to you! Thank you to the producers of this! 😄",It Actually Helps Me!
5,2021-04-30 01:43:02,"I really recommend this app.  Right when I started using this app I slept a lot better!

4,2021-05-13 05:32:26,"I just started using it to help quiet my mind so I could fall asleep faster.  The 2 times I have so far, I’m out before the story is over.  I do wish there was a couple more free stories available without a subscription.  The ones are free aren’t a good variety to see if I like it enough for a paid subscription.  Otherwise, great!",So far so good
5,2021-04-09 22:14:41,"As a newcomer to the world of tinnitus and sound sensitivity, this app has been a sanity savior. The ability to customize a wide variety of ambient sounds and “white noise” has helped me mask the ringing and keep my noise level comfortable, with enough variety to keep that I’ve yet to run out of new or interesting things to listen to.",Endless Options
5,2020-09-22 05:21:25,After using this app for long time it is amazing I love it. But when I turn my device off while the sound is playing it turn off the sound. It takes a few tries for the sound to stay on completely through the whole night.,Sleep good
4,2021-02-26 15:52:17,"I’ve suffered from anxiety and insomnia for several years.   The melodies and meditations in this app have improved my sleep schedule as well as quality of sleep, and I use the app on my Apple TV to listen to it during the day when I need background noise but don’t want traditional TV shows or news that would stress me out, which helps reduce the anxiety throughout the day.",Sleep and anxiety relief.
5,2020-05-07 14:21:52,"I have noticed that when I don’t have the sounds playing and just fall asleep to the tv, I have the craziest dreams!

My cat and dog sleep soundly with it as well!",Best app to sooth anxiety before bed
4,2020-08-05 03:53:19,"Going through an extremely difficult time in my life (being defrauded out of my savings by my general contractor, followed by the loss of my middle son and the potential to lose my newly built home), I developed a major care on insomnia.   This app not only helped me relax and get much needed sleep, it also became a core part of my nightly getting ready for bed routine. Completely love it.   The only reason there aren’t 5 stars is because I can find no way to contact the people running this show. I’d love to praise them personally (and to suggest a yoga nidra or hypnosis with a fey forest theme!)  Still, it’s a great app. It didn’t save my life, but it did help me get through some seriously horrible times.  <3",Love this app
3,2020-07-20 03:28:15,"I would rate this higher but with all the updates, I have to now pay for a yearly sub? I remember paying like $5-6 and it was amazing. I don’t need the guided meditations. I had all the sounds unlocked. Now I have to pay more? I’ve been using this app for more than 7 years. Maybe longer? It’s still a favorite. Please do something to fix this issue. Thank you",Long time user
4,2020-05-25 03:31:07,"Very nice sounds/music app. I like that you can customize and save certain sound combinations that you have made. The only thing I don’t like is that as far as I can tell, the only subscription for premium you can get is a yearly one. I’d rather subscribe on a monthly basis, or even just make a one-time purchase for premium, rather than spending $60 a year for more sounds.",Pretty good
5,2020-04-11 04:18:41,I had a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep. Laying in bed with my mind racing about random things kept me up for hours. But once this app was recommended I could just fall asleep to any sound(s) I want. I could just easily focus on the noises and not have my mind racing a mile a minute. Much love for this app!,"Love, highly recommend"
5,2019-10-30 17:45:58,"I’m impressed with this apps compatibility with my iPhone, and that it communicates and shares data with my health app. I use this app every night and especially when I’m away from home on assignments. My co workers love it too and they ask me to increase the volume of my relax melodies so they can enjoy sleeping away from home as well.",Not worth $60
5,2019-07-08 05:21:10,I am really enjoying this app. So glad I downloaded it. It's got a lot of choices. My absolute favorite thing is that you can combine sounds and music together! I fall asleep to Eternity mixed with Rainy Day every night. And you can set a timer so it stops when you want it to or leave it on all night if you want.,Perfect sleep music
1,2019-05-11 18:45:06,"I paid for full access to this app and have used it for many years.  Recently they decided some parts of the app could only be accessed if you ordered their Pro version.  This included parts of the app I had ALREADY PAID FOR AND BEEN USING!   Now, I find I can’t access some of my regular relaxation mixes because they fall under the “Pro” sounds!!   I can have access to them if I’m willing to pay $30 a year or $200 for lifetime access, but I had ALREADY paid for lifetime access!!!    They even offered promotions where you could earn access to new sounds if you shared or rated their product.  I did.  Now, THOSE sounds are off limits to me and part of the Pro bundle.      Very disappointing, because I like the app enough to pay for lifetime access a while back.   I guess we have different versions of “lifetime”.

3,2019-03-17 16:12:25,"The app itself provides lots of different sounds that can be used to help relax you and to help you sleep. It is simply amazing. My low rating is due to the fact that I have paid for the premium plan and yet I still have no access. And furthermore, there is no good way for me to get customer support. So I paid for something that I can’t get and there is seemingly no way to rectify this. It’s a shame...this really is a great app.",Great expect for one thing...
4,2019-01-19 13:53:58,For many things you have to be a pro by paying money. Otherwise this app is Excellent. You can do meditations at night and it teaches you how to breathe correctly.

4,2018-11-07 04:20:31,This is a great app. Many sounds to chose. Its fun putting together the combination sounds until you find the perfect relaxation mix.

All in all great app and it works perfect.,Many Variations
5,2018-11-02 03:57:24,"I love this app for when I’m on the road with my daughter.

5,2018-10-03 16:54:33,Love how I can mix my own sounds to make that perfect white noise. The premixed is also helpful when trying to pick something quickly to block out surrounding noise.

5,2018-05-17 04:17:18,Can’t believe what a difference this makes in my ability to get to sleep faster. I use the timer function so that it turns off after awhile so it doesn’t drain my battery. I love that you can layer different sounds and there are a ton of options for sounds to choose from!,This helped me so much
5,2018-05-09 15:14:43,This is a wonderful app for relaxation. I use it at home and in my work as a therapist. You can layer multiple sounds and fine tune the loudness of each one to get the perfect mix. It also has a timer function which is great for setting up a timed meditation. I’ve recommended the app to several friends and family members.,Awesome app
5,2018-04-27 02:50:20,"After having my children a few years ago I became accustomed to noise, the fuzzy sound from the monitors, or the rain sound from the sleep sheep. I actually downloaded this app for them one night when we were away from home, but I use it now more for myself now than the kids.",Very soothing
5,2018-04-25 22:21:30,"I work 12hr. Night shifts and when I get home and ready for bed the sun is coming up. I used to have problems getting to sleep and staying asleep. Now however, I jus play the campfire, rain, and peepers I my quality of sleep Has increased considerably.

5,2018-04-11 03:43:28,I’m absolutely love this app!! I’ve used a lot of these kinds of apps but always end up deleting them after a few days/weeks because I’m not thrilled with them but I do love this one! I love that I can customize it to fall asleep to whatever I want and the free options are seriously satisfying.,I fall asleep almost immediately
5,2018-03-19 05:44:48,I highly recommend this app! Life can get pretty stressful. This app is great to help me relax and get to sleep at night. I have even used it to help my kids get to sleep. The guided meditations have helped me fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. This app is also great when we are traveling to provide background noise to help us sleep better. I LOVE THIS APP!!,Fantastic App!
5,2018-03-04 13:40:58,So I have gotten a couple apps like this and this is the best by far you have to upgrade to pro to get all the sounds but unlike most apps it comes with like a lot of sounds to start I haven’t seen the meditation part of it yet but the best feature on this is how you can mix sounds just a great app all around,HAVE TOO READ
5,2018-01-28 03:38:08,"I love using the app when studying and when going to sleep. I love that you can make your own sound mixes! The timers and alarms make the app great too! The best thing is that if you turn off your phone, you can still hear your sound mix playing! 10/10 would definitely recommend!!",Great for Sleeping
5,2018-01-19 07:16:52,"I usually can take almost an hour to fall asleep unless I have been going nonstop for days to the point where my body is shutting down. Only then can I fall asleep quickly. This app has helped me sleep so well that I feel almost energized when I wake, I sleep easily and it’s much less tossing and turning!",Magic!
5,2018-01-01 20:41:01,Helps me sleep so well. I love how you can customize the individual sounds to make something that works just right for you. There is so much variety too! I didn’t know how many different kinds of rain and water sounds there were out there. Great for helping you relax and sleep throughout the night.,Great app!
5,2017-12-17 21:32:18,I originally got this app because my puppy barked a lot while she was  so I listen to the music to drown out her yelping. Then I realize that this app also works for driving out background noises while you’re doing homework or reading. Overall I like the music that it has it I like making different types of music and it is really good app.,AWESOME app
5,2017-12-08 08:46:01,"Really like the creative options to this app and especially, that it allows you to layer with different options and with the sound level just right. Helps with meditation, sleep and in ways that reinforce mindful living. Thumbs up to helping to take people to comfortable places and memories.",Soothing in some great selection-love it
5,2017-11-21 04:16:25,"When I want to destress or just pause for a moment this app has a sound just for that. I love how the developers give the consumer the opportunity to create the sound that fits best with their personality/moment in life/current mood. This app helps me sleep better at night, and clear my mind. Give it 5 star. Thanks again.",Relaxing
5,2017-10-20 05:40:45,"I've found my new favorite sound to sleep to with this app. I feel like I'm sleeping better than with my other app (possibly in my head but if it works it works). It's so fun to mess around with the different sounds and the app has great timers/alarms. The sounds are very good quality too, crisp and clear which I love.",My new go to sleep app
5,2017-10-19 06:07:07,"My husband is from an area with a lot of train activity. When we moved, we found it hard to sleep; so we found this app and it reminds us of home all the time and works like a charm on restless nights! I love the campfire sound, the rain on the roof and the wind sounds! So many options to fine tune the perfect relaxation sounds",Love it!!!!
5,2017-09-28 15:16:42,"There are so many mindfulness apps to choose from that one may need to meditate just to get through that selection process without going crazy. This one however makes an impression right away with its huge number of choices for sounds, songs, nature noises and melodies. It does not disappoint.",Stands out due to variety
5,2017-09-24 16:31:38,"My 9 year old grandson recommended this ap. He uses it to get to sleep, and when he heard me talking about how hard it was for me to get to sleep...he immediately said I had to get this! Haha, cute, right?

5,2017-07-29 23:14:27,"So many sounds, I love it, my favorite sound machine app. But I downloaded this app on my droid and paid $1 for the extra sounds. I re download it on to my iPhone and for the extra sounds I gotta pay yearly? Other than that I love this app. I use it when I don't have a fan or if my nieces n nephews stay over.",Since when do I have to pay yearly?
4,2017-09-13 04:47:01,It's a pretty good app! It has a lot of calming sounds to help you fall asleep. It's also so cool that you can set an actual alarm using the sounds. But it would be great if you could set the volume for each individual sound. Because some of them are too loud and some too quiet so if you could set each one to whatever you want and mix them it would be perfect :).,Pretty good!....but
5,2017-07-28 04:35:38,"I honestly love this app so so much, there is nothing that I would change. This app is how I fall asleep each and every night. The sounds are so relaxing and calming and I love it so much. It's a PERFECT app! I 100% recommend this!! Even if you don't want to use it to sleep, I do it in the middle of the day, too!! The sounds are so calming!! Please get this app. I love Relax Melodies so so much! ♥️",PERFECTION
5,2017-07-26 08:45:52,"Comes with quite a few sounds, individual volume adjustment, the ability to save your own favorite mixes, the interface is easily understandable and aesthetically pleasing and while there is a premium version the free version is very effective on its own. Helps me sleep peacefully and concentrate on my studies, definitely worth a download.",Great App
5,2017-07-19 14:02:28,"I already have a daily meditation practice and am always trying to encourage others to meditate.  I downloaded this app for sleep sounds, but it is so much more powerful than that.  I have enjoyed the flexibility it provides and also recommend it for those wanting to learn to meditate.",A wonderful way to learn meditation and great tools for sleeping
5,2017-06-30 16:03:34,This app is amazing. Even on the most stressful or anxiety-riddled days I can relax and fall asleep because of this app. Tons of sounds for everyone and can be great for meditation. I love the timers it has on it as well. Because within 10 minutes of listening I'm usually asleep and it exits the app on its own when you don't need it anymore! AMAZING. MUST GET,Must have
5,2017-06-25 09:33:31,"I literally never do these for almost any app... but when I do. It's because the app is successful in what it's trying to achieve. This has seriously helped me just about every night. I love this app and I wish I could listen to all the sounds and everything it has to offer but even without that, It's amazing!",A legit 5 stars
5,2017-06-19 03:38:41,"This app provides more features than can be described here. I downloaded the older version several years ago and have used some of the sounds and melodies for calming agitated nerves, resolving sleepless nights, and adding ambience to everyday activities. The recent upgrade seems to provide even more features. A must-have app!",Amazing App
5,2023-10-25 13:17:56,"I have been suffering from sleep deprivation for 27 years. I have tried just about everything in the book, including other sleep apps.

5,2023-03-09 22:38:46,I have chronic pain from illness. For years I don’t sleep much. Allergic to RX sleep meds. Someone recommended this type of therapy since my biggest issue is quieting my mind. First night success. Slept longer without wake ups and as I was struggling to get to sleep the music kept random thoughts away.,Great For Sleep
3,2023-02-02 08:35:36,".. it keeps crashing in the middle if a meditation or a story. Repeatedly. This app worked perfectly from October ‘22 til January 2023 and now it won’t stay on more than 5 minutes unless I’m lucky. All the best sounds, stories, etc. LOVE the mixer and the hypnosis. I just want it to work. And also make it easier to find my custom mixes (I know it’s possible but it’s not intuitive- run through the UX w someone new)",Great app but
5,2023-01-28 04:35:14,"This app has helped me sleep numerous times now and it produces pretty much any sound or atmosphere to your liking. I’m only on the free version too so there is so much more to offer, you may want to consider buying the advanced version. It’ll be worth it!",Wonderful sound selection
3,2023-01-31 16:04:26,"I love the sounds and customization! Great work to let users curtail to their desires. Unfortunately, the app is let down by a pretty UI that is poorly designed.   Lots of scrolling side to side, messy configuration windows, poor handling of multiple audio streams concurrently, and, seriously, why is there no output control?!  I have to start the playback, lock the device, and, then I can choose a homepod or other device. It's a simple button provided by Apple to make UX-friendly experiences.  I'm tired of getting blasted by my phone audio output when I want to play to an external device. All of the major competitors to this app use that API so users can set the output BEFORE tracks begin playing.","Great sounds, terrible UI"
5,2023-01-06 08:21:43,"I really enjoy the sounds feature and have been playing them every night. I sleep so well with them! And I enjoy creating whatever noise I want :) looking forward to more releases of sounds. I have yet to try bedtime stories, but I absolutely love this app",Sound Asleep

5,2022-12-19 05:48:40,I suffer with PTSD and so tired of taking all the medication that is supposed to help me sleep and cope with being in the “real world “  But as soon as I started using this app I have been able to sleep without as much medication and it seems to be helping while I am awake also.,It works! !!!!
5,2022-11-20 02:57:41,"I listened to the app all night long, 2 nights in a row. I slept all the way through from 9:30-6. I usually wake up numerous times during the night. Woke up refreshed, haven’t felt like that in years. Going to try a different choice tonight and see if I get the same result.",The best deep sleep
5,2022-09-15 00:53:29,From binaural rhythms to body scans and imaginative stories; the options are endless and I’ve never had a dull experience using this app. I’ve been a premium subscriber for at least three years and always find something new and creative.,Wonderful experience
5,2022-08-20 03:10:31,"I just downloaded this app (trying the 7-day trial) and I love it… BUT it keeps crashing. I’m not sure what the glitch is, but if it continues to randomly shut off, I’m going to cancel my subscription. That said, the way you can customize your sleep mix is absolutely amazing. So calming.",Great but…
5,2022-04-06 02:43:22,As my husband and i have gotten older our sleep patterns have changed. this app has helped us achieve more consistent sleep simply by playing it at night. what started as a way to sleep when. or at home has now become our nightly routine.,It’s part of the nighttime routine
4,2022-08-16 18:53:09,"I love this app, I fall asleep easily with it at night. Gives me some weird dreams, but overall helps me sleep better. I wish I didn’t have to pay for everything especially since you can’t even preview the sounds, music, etc. Love the app though.","Love the app, wish I didn’t have to pay for almost everything"
5,2022-03-01 04:21:17,Tired of just white noise or someone’s voice telling you to relax? Mix your own sounds. Millions of combinations plus binaural plus guided meditations. No monthly fees - one fee. I own most of the meditation apps and this is the best. If you can’t find satisfaction here perhaps yoga or jogging is better for you.,Great choices and mixes
4,2022-03-23 02:07:20,"I love this app so much! I love the art style as well! But I do wish more was free. I listened to all the free stories at least a hundred times! And I do want more free stories to listen to. Other then that this app is perfect! I love it so much! Thanks to all the developers and whoever else helped with this app, including the people who responded to each and every review, love the effort! ❤️",One problem
1,2022-03-20 03:20:01,"I have relied on this app to sleep for so many years. Used to. I have had to constantly repay for this app, constant glitches, constant updates. Every single time it deletes my saved info and makes me repay to gain access to the full option of sounds. This app used to be very high quality. Would not recommend this app to anyone who needs to feel relaxed and calm. Would not recommend to anyone who needs sound apps to sleep. Outrageously frustrated.",Wish they would stop ruining my sleep
5,2022-02-05 04:05:50,"I’ve been using the free version of the app for a short time. Most things are locked, but they do have some sounds and meditations that can be used without purchasing. So far I like it and will consider purchasing the year subscription.",Helps you relax

5,2021-11-17 08:23:17,"I have never left a review for an app before, at least not in detail like this.

Highly recommend for those struggling with sleep.",Savior for Sleep
5,2021-10-25 07:48:35,I love it so much and if you are looking at this I advise you to download this it has soothing stories relaxing meditations and if you like asmr to help you sleep then the first page that shows up you can choose sounds that help you sleep or relax if you’ve had a stressful day:),It helps me
5,2021-10-06 14:48:18,"This is such an amazing app! I’ve been able to fall asleep amazingly quickly and wake up to nice, refreshing sounds to start my day! Best alarm I’ve ever had! I love that you can create your own sound mixes or find some already made ones! Great app I highly recommend!",Amazing 🤩
5,2021-09-04 06:30:38,I enjoy this app along with the great narrators. I hate the apps where the narrator talks like she’s in slow motion to make the story longer.. it stresses me out trying to finish the sentence and does not help me fall asleep. They have some really good stories that I never get to hear the end because I’m asleep!,Love the stories!!
4,2021-07-10 11:20:18,I LOVE THIS APP!! I would give it 5 stars but you do have to pay for some sounds. But other than that there are a lot of free sounds you can use. I love that you can put your own sounds choices together and move the level of amount you want to hear it. It’s a great app and I fall asleep to it every night! I 100% recommend!❤️❤️❤️,Amazing app
5,2021-06-30 03:18:19,I think it is very relaxing but you can  buy some things but if you don’t want too you can always make some relaxing sound but I do recommend this app for people with sleeping problems.,This app is so relaxing too me and maybe to others!😍☺️
5,2021-05-10 01:01:37,I love this app. I can find those sounds that sooth me and then mix and match just to my liking.

And feeling more energetic to the mornings.,Unbelievably a wonderful app!
3,2021-06-09 00:35:41,"I’ve lowered my rating from 5 down to 3 because while I LOVE the app and sounds every single time I log in it wants me to rate it. I already did. Twice now. Also it doesn’t remember I paid because it’s always offering me half off a year, which would start in 7 days. I already paid like $55 for the family year. Give me half money back? Or stop with the ads. It’s ahhhh. Thanks.",It’s a Great app

5,2020-01-03 06:32:07,It is amazing! Headphones are the BEST experience! Exceptionally cavern. But there is one con. Can you let us have premium for free? So many other sounds that have a monthly payment! Kids can’t just go to their parents and ask “Hey mommy can you do a monthly payment so I could have more sounds?” It’s just not right. Can you make it all free?,This is amazing!
5,2019-09-18 05:57:48,Just discovered this app and what a great way to end my crazy busy day. I have been sleep deprived for many years and for me ~~ this is a great gift from the creators   Thanks for being so empathetic to those who are truly in need of HELP with sleep   Thanks to you My night was filled with the sounds of the waves crashing.

5,2019-06-10 21:47:17,These sounds are very soothing....I use them for relaxing and sleeping. If you like the sound of rain there are at least 5 different versions in the free version of this app. Also you can layer many sounds on top of each other with different volumes—so you can really fine tune the sound that YOU want.,Relax Melodies
5,2019-01-07 05:43:44,"I’ve started meditating with my 6 year old and we use this app almost every night. She loves to pick and mix the sounds.

1,2019-05-14 12:11:32,"The app is somewhat limited for users who do not pay. The first night I used it, I had nightmares and could hear the music provided by the app labeled piano. Also I have never kept walked before and the second night I used this I got up from bed in my sleep and took a shower at 1 in the morning. My brother came home from work and apparently couldn’t get in the bathroom as it was locked and he heard the shower running.

4,2019-04-25 07:43:45,"The subscription model is unwanted and very expensive, especially for what I use this app for - mixing sleep sounds.  I would by this for the sleep sounds only for 5 bucks or less, easy. I do not use the other features, so I can’t speak to them.  The sleep sounds offered for free are very nice and the app saves my mix from my last session.","Great sounds for sleep, terrible pricing"
5,2018-12-17 02:04:43,I’ve been using this app just for the white noise for about a year now. Recently I’ve started taking advantage of the meditations to help relax before falling asleep. I highly recommend this if you haven’t yet. My favorite touch is your own customized ‘noise’ is in the background while the guided meditation relaxes you to sleep.,The best sleep
4,2018-12-30 19:25:52,"Don’t get me wrong, I ❤️ this app. But, the amount that you miss out if you are not willing to pay $200 to get all the sounds. I am not willing and not able to spend money like that. I have a hard time sleeping and whales are very helpful noises, but I would have to pay. I really love this app but there is still improvement. I even use this for my pets! Keep up the good work.",Good but...
5,2018-12-13 01:11:36,I purchased this app for about $50 to receive all the sounds available only to have many sounds blocked but the developer responded quickly to my one star review and said to tap the Restore subscription button under Profile/Settings and it worked. I’m very pleased now with the app.,Happy Now
5,2018-11-13 02:46:17,"I used to carry a white noise device for travel. It drowned out hotel noises and replaced the (real) fan noise I had back home.   No more. This app is all I need.

Love it!",Perfect for travel
4,2018-11-30 07:45:08,"I only rate this a 4 because there so many additional sounds that I would love to hear, without paying. However, this puts me to sleep within 30 minutes, I know this because of the best “timer” feature; I like this feature because I can fall asleep peacefully, but not be awoken by it in the middle of the night.

5,2018-08-21 20:11:55,I find this app to be incredibly helpful in the never ending process of finding effective ways to manage stress. I love finding different ways of layering sounds to create a mix that helps during different times of day. It also helps bring the outside inside when I’m at a desk during the day!,Stress management help
5,2018-08-21 05:16:53,I was in the worst phase of PTSD and was undergoing EMDR therapy. My sleep was absolutely terrible. This app allowed me to customize the sounds depending on what random thing would help me sleep at that particular time. I especially appreciate being able to stack sounds and change the volume of each sound within the mix. Best app ever.,Love this - got me through PTSD
5,2018-08-06 03:28:18,"I love that this app is free and I can choose from so many sounds, unlike other similar apps. Creating your own unique sound that triggers your relaxation mode is so awesome. I also enjoy the fact I can set a timer so my sound will turn off on its own after a certain period of time.",Puts me in relaxation mode instantly
4,2018-08-17 11:41:18,.... in my opinion.  I have had this app for a while but saw adds for other white noise apps and decided to try two of them.  I was pleased to find that they couldn’t hold a dime to this one.  There were so many sounds that had to be purchased on the other sites.   I never give five stars because nothing is perfect.   This is as close as I’ll get😀,Best white noise App on market....
5,2018-08-05 07:43:20,Very good variety of sounds. It’s good for sleeping and focusing. There’s so many to mix and match without paying for a premium version. You can adjust the volume on each individual sound to get just the right mix of maybe rain and orchestral music. You can also save your favorite mixes of sounds,Wonderful
5,2018-07-19 01:51:35,"Great selection of sounds, especially love being able to create my own sound combinations. Excellent for meditation and background white noise. (Even turned it on during a family vacation once and everyone commented on how relaxing it was.) My go-to for blocking distracting background noise at the office and meditating at home.",Excellent app
5,2018-07-17 03:12:02,I downloaded this app a while back. I use it regularly when I travel. It’s perfect! You can pick the different sounds you like to “compose” the white noise that’s perfect for you. You can lower or raise the volume on a specific sound. And you can save the sound mix so you can use it again.,Perfect for travel
5,2018-07-09 05:56:26,"When I first found the app, I was super excited to find out that you could create your own relaxing sounds!!! And the fact that the app gives you a wide variety for free makes it even better 👍🏻 I’ve recommended the app to a bunch of friends that I know use soothing sounds to sleep. They all love it! 💜 blessings!!",Awesome!!
5,2018-07-07 06:12:52,The mix of rain and slow waves is the exactly my desired sound.  We sleep with this playing all night long. It is super relaxing! Wherever we are spending the night on vacation or visiting family; we always sleep just wonderful as if we are home due to the familiar sounds of home!,Rain & slow waves
5,2018-06-23 10:22:58,"Of all my Meditation apps, this is my favorite. I love to be able to set the background sounds  that compliment my meditation. There are so many sounds to choose from depending on your mood. I love to listen to these sounds when I can’t sleep. They relax me and stop my mind from racing. Works every time to give me the rest I need.",Relaxing Melodies
1,2018-06-19 02:42:58,"If I could have given this less than one star I would have. I actually loved the app until I did the most recent update. What the description of the update doesn’t tell you is that once you do it, almost every meditation become a “pro” option. So unless you are willing to pay a monthly fee all those meditations you may have been using are useless.   This is very much like a bait and switch. Fall in love with the app and think that an update can only make it better but quickly find out you are wrong.",Disappointed
5,2018-06-10 07:46:08,Probably the best app I've used for white noise! It helps me fall asleep so quick! Definitely recommended for anybody who either has trouble getting to sleep or who just wants to try something new! I love how you can adjust the different sounds to different levels over top of each other.,Great for bed!
5,2018-06-07 14:44:46,"Relax melodies is the best ambient music app that I have ever owned plus so much more. With so many options to create the music you want, Relax Melodies has put me to sleep shorter then any other app that Ive had; and it isn’t just for sleeping either. Meditation, relaxation, and unwinding are all possible with the simple touch of a finger with this app. Thanks Relax Melodies.",5+ stars for Relax Melodies
5,2018-06-06 07:39:57,"Lots of sound options even if you don’t pay, love that you can make your own mix of sounds and control the volume of them. Even has a timer so it doesn’t play all night while you’re sleeping.  Helps me relax and sleep. I downloaded a few apps at the same time and this was the best one",Love it
5,2018-05-22 07:01:39,I've been using this app on a nightly basis for the past few years or so and I absolutely love it. It has a wide variety of sounds to choose from and I love that you can mix and match to create your own unique sound mix. It's an amazing app and I could not be any happier with it. Definitely recommended to everyone!,Excellent!!
5,2018-05-21 01:59:01,Best sound machine app I've found! There are so many different sounds available and I love that you can combine them as well. Will play continuously for hours even while using other apps or when my phone or iPad is locked. I use it every night to sleep and would recommend it to anyone.,Love this app!
5,2018-05-18 07:57:52,"This app is one of the best investments i’ve made on bettering my sleep and relaxation. It’s been great for my anxiety and helping to develop new and more healthy patterns. It also came in handy when my close friend was in the hospital with a brain injury. Was so helpful in aiding in his relaxation and rest, helping drown out horrible hospital sounds and aid in much needed rest for recovery.",I love this app!!!
5,2018-05-18 03:51:42,I love using this app to help me relax and sleep.  It’s really cool that you can combine different sound effects and make your own sounds. I also like listening to the different meditations.  Ever since I’ve gotten this app I’ve been able to fall sleep faster and stay asleep longer. I highly recommend this app.,Works for me
5,2018-05-18 01:43:21,"Absolutely love that you can customize everything about your sounds. I use it at night for myself and my children. This app is exactly what I was looking for. I love the mix between melodies and nature sounds, love the timer and alarm. I haven't played with the meditations much but am excited to check them out!",Love the app so far
5,2018-05-15 03:13:09,"I absolutely love this app! There is a generous variety of free sounds to chose from, although a few more meditations would be nice. I use this to help myself fall asleep and even use it when I babysit. Kids have so much fun mixing sounds to their heart’s desire! This is a great app for anyone, but especially those with trouble falling asleep. Highly recommended!",Love it!
5,2018-05-06 08:10:07,"Definitely 5 stars. I also like the fact that it lets you combine the sounds too. It also has a timer on it for whenever you want it to stop playing sounds at a certain amount of time. It’s even good for people who have insomnia, like me. I definitely recommend this app",Great for falling asleep
5,2018-04-27 13:01:43,"While this is the first app of this type I have tried, I have been quite pleased.  I have chronic back pain and while it does not alleviate my pain, it does provide help with relaxing and sleeping, for which I am very grateful.  Many ways to combine sounds, and fun to hear some combinations created by my kids.  Thanks!",Nice product; helpful
4,2018-05-06 06:08:11,"Love this app, there are so many options. But that's part of the problem. It's a lot to scroll through and they're in no particular order. If they could be grouped or listed alphabetically, that would be great. Also, it would be nice to have the option to store more than one favorite mix. Moods change, hence so does the need for different mixes.",Just a few tweaks
5,2018-04-26 03:21:12,I’m a Veterinary student and I am under a ton of stress every day. This app has been super helpful in distracting my brain so I can stop thinking at night and just sleep. Love all the sound options and the layering to make something soothing yet noisy enough that I can’t concentrate on the thoughts normally racing in my head at night.,Very useful with my steer and anxiety
5,2018-03-15 02:57:53,Have been using this app for over a year to lull myself to sleep for those times when my brain just wouldn't shut off. (Love the shut-off timer feature!) We recently had a baby and now use it every night to put on white noise for him... It really helps him fall asleep and stay asleep. Great app!!,Great for baby
5,2018-01-25 08:37:40,I love all the sounds!! It's so relaxing and definitely helps me fall asleep a lot faster than normal. It just puts my mind at such ease and makes me forget everything else. I love how easy it is to use it and how I can have a timer on it so it stops after I have fallen asleep. I use this on my infant as well. He loves it too! Thank you!!! :),Absolutely Love It!!!
5,2018-01-13 22:45:24,"Not only did it fun to layer these beautiful, realistic sounds to create custom soundscapes, but they are also incredibly soothing! Since using this app, my sleep has been deeper. I also find that putting on sounds with the timer app can help carve out time to center, breathe, or focus, creating a pause in the day to recharge.",A wonderful aid for sleep and centering
5,2017-12-28 03:29:41,I’ve enjoyed this app for roughly a year now and I don’t know what I did before it. I’ve created a sound sequence that puts me to sleep in under 10 minutes! I use to take hrs to fall asleep. I wake up refreshed & ready for whatever the day brings. I’ve also referred this app to over a dozen family & friends. What a great app!,Better Sleep
5,2017-11-09 17:27:53,"I work in an open work environment, so I often use this app to block out distractions. It’s great for that, especially the white noise sound. I also like using the timer to help me track project time, by giving myself a certain amount of time to focus before I move on to something else.",Great for concentrating at work
4,2017-11-26 04:06:10,"I remember when this app was still new and didnt have much. I redownloaded it and it got so much bigger! Its still really nice though. It has got that classy calm feel to it which has helped me sleep many a night. The only complaint it all of the ""pro"" features now with you have to pay for. But other than that what is free is really well made and just nice all around.",Really good app
5,2017-10-28 12:13:15,The free version gives you enough choices to get a good understanding into what can create a meditative zone. If these aren’t enough to quell your inner peace then go ahead & take the plunge & but the entire program.  Very satisfied with content. Made me feel more serene when things weren’t. Get it you will enjoy for it’s peace & tranquility.,Relax to your content
5,2017-09-29 16:48:20,I have no words....this app truly caught me off guard.I wanted an app with sounds to fall asleep but this took it to another level...the sounds provided are incredible and being able to put them together and save them is also a very unique touch...I listen to these sounds when i am stress or sad...it gives me peace,Amazing
5,2017-09-29 08:26:27,"I used this app years ago as a lullaby for my daughter and had to delete for lack of space. Whoops. Anyway, fast forward 3 years and I’ve redownloaded it. Not only was it somewhat nostalgic, but I remember now how awesome it was to have the soothing sounds on a timer. The customizable freedom is also a huge plus.  Definitely recommend.",Love it
5,2017-08-20 00:35:44,We have been using this app since 2013 when our oldest child was born.  It is a must have for all parents!  The sounds are very customizable and the app is easy to use.

5,2017-08-06 05:16:24,"I have always struggled with falling asleep because my mind races all night, but this app has been a life saver. Before I found this app, I considered asking my doctor to give me sleeping pills, but now I don't have to rely on a pill to help me sleep (that is how much this app has helped me). I hope that it works for you too!",The most amazing app I have.
5,2017-08-06 02:40:20,"My daughter found/has this app. She showed me when she began using this with her first child and that was 7 yrs ago. She is having baby #3 and still uses it.

Anyways this app is awesome and as I've been since I got it I highly recommend this.",First and only app I'll use
5,2017-07-21 00:00:04,"Working in the mental health field, I often look for sound machines to 1) help create noise to not accidentally break confidentially, and 2) create a relaxing environment for myself and my clients.  Sound machines have proven to be expensive, unreliable, and usually short lived.  I love this app to be able to use an effective sound machine for relaxation and privacy in a pinch.",Awesome Find
5,2023-10-26 04:48:30,It helps me sleep and I can feel free and be relaxed and ready for the day ahead and it is still great if you do not pay it is optional to pay or not which in my life that is great I love this app I hope you do to I need this app to sleep I’ve had t for about 9 years and I’m only 10!!!!,I love this

3,2023-10-26 03:04:13,"I love the app but since it was bought out the ads are out of control. I literally use it for one thing, I set up a mix for while I’m sleeping. Now every time I open it and at random times it will pop up an ad trying to get me to pay for extra features I have never used or wanted. I had a 5-star review on this app before the buyout.",It was better when it was Relax Melodies
4,2023-08-09 04:37:28,"I may amend my rating to 5 stars in the future. My last sleep app closed down so I had to scramble to find a replacement. This app has many features I don’t know I will use; track your sleep, wake you up, blend sounds.. For me I just want the same music every night to get that Pavlovian sleep response going.",I’m starting at 4
5,2023-07-28 05:18:56,"With my stressful job, this app works well for me. I am sorry I can no longer enjoy the limited number of sounds for free. With prices increasing on everyday items, I would hope this app developer would not find it necessary to no longer offer the free version.",Great app!

5,2023-01-24 02:41:25,"I’ve had this app for about a week. So far I’m enjoying it very much. It definitely has helped me with my sleep. My only question is, do they add new stories occasionally? Because I’ve pretty much been through them all the ones that interest me anyway.",BetterSleep

5,2022-12-20 03:09:08,I needed something that played regardless of internet connection. Little did I know how unique this app was.

2,2022-06-23 09:24:39,"All of the good sounds are hidden behind paywalls. The free selection is very limited and with varying quality. I only use apps like this for rain/storm type sounds. Unless you’re willing to pay, this one isn’t it if you’re in the same position. The storm/thunder sounds are a bit tinny, and the rain sounds like my upstairs neighbor peeing into his sink at 2am. Even combining 4-5 different sounds, it’s an inauthentic mish-mash rather than an approximation of stormy ambience.",Free version is weak.
5,2022-05-02 01:38:23,This is the best sleep app I have experienced yet. Love the ability to increase and decrease the voice and sounds independently. You don’t realize how important that feature is until you look for it and realize you don’t have it. Better Sleep has it all.,Great app!
5,2022-04-11 04:19:31,I use it when I’m having trouble sleeping and it works like a charm! I also like to listen when I’m on the train or reading.

5,2022-02-17 04:11:36,"Calm serene and tranquil is how you will feel using this app. It is so important to have tolerable voices with guided meditation and all of them are lovely, soothing, and not annoying at all!

2,2022-02-24 01:30:58,I like the app it’s very relaxing and gives you the creativity to creat the sounds that make you feel relaxed but I do not enjoy the fact that most things are locked requiring some sort of payment method making it harder to truly enjoy the app questioning if the app is worth the use of storage or if there is a better app or if there’s any use of a sleep app all together also something will load and never play,Honest Rating
5,2022-02-13 05:34:19,"I use this app all the time! But the most recent update has prevented this app from launching. Every time I open it, it would crash and then close. I’ve tried restarting my device and even uninstalling and reinstalling this app.",It’s great but issue with the update
2,2022-02-17 02:58:17,You pay for a year and it keeps locking you out. Very annoying. Each time you’re locked out they tell you to close app re-download it again. But I’ve done it three times now since I’ve had this app. I’ve only used it for less than a week. I shouldn’t have to keep closing the app re-opening it to continue to use it. If they can fix this problem I will change my review.,This app is not consistent.
5,2022-02-11 23:07:19,I really like the app. I fall asleep very quick and I  like that it has a timer so I can turn it off anytime. I like all the sounds and that you can make mixes of any one you want/your favorites!  I’d definitely recommend this if you like white noise while you sleep.,App Review
4,2022-01-24 18:23:09,"Haven’t used the other features enough yet but just for the ability to create my own ambient sounds I love the app. The price for it just to use the sounds is too high, I’ll have to see how I feel about the other features during the free trial before I’m willing to pay the yearly fee.",Love the sound features
3,2021-11-24 15:33:29,Paying as much money as this asks for per just a one year subscription (there are no other choices) you’d think this app would be more involved. There’s other apps that are cheaper that offer a sleep tracker and you can click it and it records your sleep. You’re getting less here than what the other apps are doing.,Extra money for less stuff
5,2021-10-21 03:58:59,This app (even without the amazing paid *and worthwhile* subscription) is the best I’ve ever found. It’s the only one I trust as it has some AMAZING sounds that I can customize to make my sleep something great. I wish all the good for the saints that made this wonderful app.,The best thing for my insomnia ridden disaster of sleep
5,2021-10-10 04:35:45,I've been using relax melodies for a little over two months now and i love it! my favorite thing about it is how you change the individual sounds in your mix to make them louder or quieter. i also love the timer setting so it doesn't run my battery down while i'm sleeping!,THE BEST SLEEP APP EVER!!
5,2021-10-02 04:04:04,Signed up for annual subscription and haven’t regretted so far. Only thing I would like would be a wider variety of sounds to choose from and would like them to be updated more often. Feels like I’ve been hearing the same thing for weeks. Thanks,Great app
5,2021-08-18 07:15:29,I’ve moved from a large metro city to a tiny town with no noise at night.

5,2019-07-14 12:38:47,I have insomnia and I find that putting on the same Relaxing Melodies sound every-night while getting ready for bed helps me get in ‘sleep mode’. I love that I can play the melodies on my phone while it is changing; the variety of of sounds is great. Sometimes I will play two at the same time.,Best way to fall asleep

3,2019-04-01 08:48:45,I used to love this app. Swore by it and couldn’t sleep without it. I never updated it from the original version I downloaded years ago and randomly decided to update it-worse decision ever. The old version use to continue to play when I would snooze my alarm this one doesn’t. I also noticed recently it’s been randomly crashing and subsequently disrupting my sleep. Please fix these issues. I loved this app!,Crashes
5,2018-12-02 10:55:27,My grad school professor recommended this to me a few years ago when we were getting ready to take a flight from US to Hong Kong and I’ve been using it ever since - not only for plane rides but for restless nights.

5,2018-11-22 07:23:48,"I love how you can put together so many sounds. It really is great.

5,2018-11-12 14:58:43,"I love that I can have as few or as many sounds as I want and adjust the individual volumes for each. This allows me to adjust when I need a quick nap, sleep for the night, or something for the background when I’m in my office. Definitely worth the download!",So many options!
5,2018-11-09 05:46:30,"This app is wonderful. ImAnytime I'm in public and I'm feeling anxious, I simply put in headphones and listen to the melodies and it calms me so much.

(It does take a lot of data, though)",great app

5,2018-10-01 03:56:45,It’s helpful when you can’t sleep and I use this app every night it is just that more than half of the sounds you have to pay monthly to use but I guess I can expect that because they have to make money somehow Other than that I’ve never had a problem with this app 👍,Good app
5,2018-09-25 06:14:41,"This app is awesome for the creative nature lover. It’s so easy to make your own mix for what ever you need.

5,2018-09-06 06:00:23,We travel a lot and having this app at my fingertips makes falling asleep a breeze.

5,2018-07-29 01:40:22,"I've tried countless ""White Noise/Background Noise"" to help me sleep, focus, etc. and this far outweighs them all! I was recently traveling, was dreading the flight, after I was seated (and buckled) I opened the app and put one of my favorite relaxation melodies on (which works in Airplane Mode ✈️); I was asleep before the plane had even finished boarding! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",Amazing
4,2018-07-31 04:01:10,"Relax Melodies is a great app for making your own blend of relax sounds. The free portion gives you a surprising number of options. It’s become a regular part of my day, for meditation and also to help fall asleep.  I like that each sound you add has a volume control. Each sound can be as loud or soft as you like.

4,2018-07-12 01:52:41,"I love this app because it helps me fall asleep when anxiety keeps me up. I only wish that pro could come with a one time payment rather than a monthly payment because I’d much rather pay one time than monthly. Unless the payment becomes one time, I won’t be purchasing pro. Otherwise, this app is great. The non-pro features are amazing and plentiful. Lots of variety.",Great app!
4,2018-07-08 05:05:15,"This app has been great! I like that I can customize the sounds that are most relaxing to me. Also, another big reason I love this app is that I can put a timer on so it isn’t running all night.

4,2018-06-27 11:12:08,I have the worst insomnia! I’ve always slept with the tv because I need a distraction and it would take hours to fall asleep sometimes! This works almost instantly.

The alarm never went off in the morning. When I went to check the sleep tracking results, the app wouldn’t open. Tried to delete the app and redownload, it continued to crash.

1,2022-06-09 03:43:22,I first listened when it was called relax Melodies.  Today this app is bungled and botched by money grubbing. All I have have listened to to fall asleep is brown and pink noise.  As they kept adding more and more nonsense sounds I still listened trying to find those basic sounds they buried with nonsense noises. Today they locked the only basic sounds anyone wants to listen to.   Take a a look at the ridiculous sounds they confuse you with.  Who would listen to any of it?

Lots of wonderful sounds to help you relax, unwind, & fall asleep like nature sounds; rain, ocean waves, birdies tweeting softly, a fan blowing, leaves, windchimes, etc.  One of my faves is a crackling campfire, a kitty purring, crickets chirping, and a frog croaking.

4,2021-06-19 05:18:38,I really enjoy the sounds that they have for free in this app but I wish that y’all would put all the available free sounds together so that one does not have to scroll through a ton of sounds before finding one that is free. But I do recommend this app. And it truly is relaxing and peaceful.,Good but could be better
5,2021-06-08 02:43:24,"Tried them all- this is by far the best. They are very generous with the sound options in the regular free version, but the upgraded version is AMAZING. I use it to fall asleep at night - every single night.  Lately, my husband and I have tried the meditations together to fall asleep and our sleep quality improved after the very first one!! No joke. My nightmares and sleep talking have diminished significantly (says my husband- but don’t feel too bad for him. He snores ;) Ooo! Perhaps you can create a meditation that helps with snoring??!).

I have a couple I use for my young sons naps and quite a few I use for me time. The many categories never get old!",Great options for every mood
5,2018-01-24 04:39:50,"So many choices. I listened for free a few nights and then had to buy the pro package to see what I was missing. It is worth it. The sounds are so soothing, and I love how you can play with combining them. They haven’t failed to make sleep come easier and stay longer. And I haven’t even tried the aural bests yet.",Love this app
4,2018-01-26 02:38:32,"I’ve always had issues with falling right to sleep.  Not anymore with this app. Before, it would take me at least an hour to nod off. Now I’m asleep within a few minutes of turning the app on. My only gripe is that there isn’t an option to set it on timer to turn off at a certain time. That would make the app perfect.",My new sleep buddy!
5,2018-01-07 09:11:39,"This app has become a favorite of mine for relaxation before bedtime. It is quite versatile, and with all the choices, you can really customize what you listen to on any day. If you don't set the timer, it will play continuously until you actually turn it off. Certainly one of the best apps out there!",Relaxation!
5,2017-11-15 06:54:32,"downloaded a few weeks ago and was instantly amazed! Not just for the ease of use, but for the clear sounds! They have a large range of sounds and a neat way to mesh specific ones together. Within 5 minutes of putting this on, i'm knocked out. Works wonderfully with newborn babies as well!",Best Sleep App
4,2017-12-28 06:39:16,I was amazed at how realistic the rain sound was and I love that it is interactive as well. It is a bit confusing to use at first and also could be annoying to your partner if they are sleeping bc you have to play around with a bunch of different sounds before you get it right. Overall glad to have rain storm one click away,Not bad at all!
4,2017-12-21 09:37:07,"Very good sounds, best sleep aid app that I’ve used. Has a big selection of free sounds, and even more if paid. Only con I have is that the musical sounds loop too quickly, in other words after 20-30 secs it repeats and for me that’s a little distracting. If they were bumped up even to a minute or a little more it probably wouldn’t be noticeable. But other than that, I love it!",Exceptional
5,2017-11-12 13:41:55,I've always had a difficult time achieving deep restful sleep. Waking up every 30 minutes or so all night long. The sounds on this app when mixed help out me in a trance like state. Allowing me to get several hours of uninterrupted sleep. I still haven't gone a full 8 hours yet but this app is great.,Really helps with deep sleep
5,2017-10-28 02:18:22,I have tried apps like this before but found the sounds very generic and not that relaxing. Relaxing melodies has a very large range of options and you can create thousands yourself. There are so many unique sounds that you can find truly relaxing. I recommend it... it’s wonderful,Wonderful and relaxing
5,2017-10-23 03:43:31,"this has been my FAVORITE sleep app for years! i'm so glad they added more sounds, the price is well worth it. the combinations are endless. i even have a calming playlist for when i'm doing homework or just trying to read and relax! i love it so much it's the only app on my lower iphone icon bar! :)",the best sleep app there is!
5,2017-10-11 12:45:44,"There are a lot of sound apps out there but this one is by far my favorite.

I suffer from insomnia and it really helps to put me to bed.. rain sounds in general, I like the rain mixed with the fireplace sounds.. I set the timer for 35 mins so it can turn off and not drain my battery and within 5 mins I’m asleep. Great, great app!",Puts me right to sleep!
5,2017-10-06 03:08:30,"I really struggle with shutting down at the end of the day. I only have the basic version but they still provide a wide selection of soothing sounds and background noises.

5,2017-10-02 03:17:52,"I was using this long before I was married, and that's been a couple years.  I used the White Noise one last night to help my son go to sleep & it worked great to help keep him calm & sleeping.

Thanks so much- you've helped me get some great nights' sleep abroad.,Soothing sounds!

5,2017-09-07 05:12:24,This app has helped me get back to my happy place honestly. I have trouble relaxing at night these days and this lovely app has fixed that like nothing else has.

Would definitely buy again.",Soothing Sounds
4,2017-07-11 03:44:24,"Great variety of sounds once purchased. I found the selections limited until then.

Overall happy with app and would suggest buying it if you want a few more options!",Good Selection of Sounds if Purchases
5,2017-06-19 10:48:24,"I love this app.  With so many individual sounds to choose from you can layer up an infinite amount of possibilities.  The sounds to choose from are really good and I like that you can save anything you come up with as a favorite.  Using it as a sleep machine, I especially like the timer function.",So many possibilities
5,2017-06-18 06:05:33,This app has a nice and varied selection of sounds to choose from. I like that you can combine several sounds as well as music. It's helpful for meditation and sleep. I always use it for when I can't go to sleep and I usually can within 20 minutes of listening to it.,Always puts me to sleep
5,2017-06-09 13:54:07,Fun and easy to combine different sounds and save your favorites. I don't use it all the time but it does what it says in a very polished way. Just found the bedside clock feature. I might try that to easily see what time it is if I wake up in the night.  Expertly created. I don't find the ads too annoying.,It's good!
5,2023-08-05 04:15:24,I would literally never survive without this app. I have been using it for over 5 years as a lifetime subscriber and have become basically dependent on this app to sleep. It has amazing sound mixing abilities with tons of ways to customize. Best sleep app out there!,Worth it!
5,2023-05-06 06:26:10,"I love that you can pick from a HUGE list of sounds and try different combinations, and that theres so many talented men and women voicing these stories/Meditations.

5,2023-02-16 04:33:42,Still on the free trial level and am considering upgrading. I like how you can isolate and remove (or increase) certain sounds on a soundscape. I’ve been using the brown noise for a few nights and find it very relaxing. Easy and beautiful interface.,Liking it so far
5,2023-02-13 16:43:45,"I had concerns I couldn’t listen to this app plus other music apps simultaneously, but it seems they’ve added a feature recently that allows this. Truly thankful for that. Their team followed up with my concerns with kindness even when I was cranky! Major kudos.",Lovely

4,2023-01-24 07:36:14,I have insomnia and everyone I listen to this app I fall sleep pretty fast. It’s so calming and relaxing.  The only thing I would really like Better Sleep to do is open up more of their selection to the people that don’t want to pay for the subscription. I’m not saying all of it but just a few more options.,Great app
4,2023-01-23 03:40:38,I have very loud neighbors and I have to go to bed early to get up early. This app has the perfect sounds and settings to allow me to drown out their noise and listen to peaceful sounds so I can sleep. The only reason I took off a star is because most of the sounds require the subscription.,Better than expected
5,2022-11-15 10:50:44,"I have narcolepsy, which means I don’t spend a lot of time in deep sleep…except for with this app!

4,2022-11-06 16:31:17,The sounds stop after 30 minutes for me? Or when it thinks I’m asleep and I have it listening to my sleep? I’m not sure what the deal is but I can’t use the sleep feature because the turning off of the sounds wake me up every time which is counter productive lol. But I’m do enjoy the sounds!,I like it but
5,2022-09-20 04:01:58,I am a new person after using this app regularly for over two years. By far the best part of my day is crawling into bed and listening one of the wonderful features of this app. It’s worth every penny to upgrade the app.,New person after
5,2021-12-19 03:21:00,"I have the limited version of this app so I can’t access the stories or meditations, but the background sounds are great for sleep.

So please allow people turn on the repeat story.",Amazing app but..
5,2021-11-11 23:01:11,"Yes it does cost a lot. However, if you need guided meditations, or, a simple way to unwind and relax. It is 100% worth your money. I, personally, have slept good ever since I downloaded the app and tried the trial.  Try out the trial first, see if it works for you, and if not, then, find another.",This app is amazing.

I feel so much more energized and rejuvenated in the morning! You guys should give it a try!,Definitely Recommend!!
4,2021-05-24 15:59:04,"I like that you can mix all kinds of sounds and make your own playlist (though there are quite a few locked ones) and there's no ads to deal with. My only complaint is the recordings loop every 30 seconds or so, like the rain for example. But for a free app, I can't really complain.",Pretty good
5,2020-10-14 19:07:38,I downloaded this app about a year ago just to hear rain sounds while I slept. But I got obsessed with it after I realized how quickly the stories made me fall asleep!

The built in sounds help block out any background noises and do help me to focus.  I don’t use this app for sleep although I don’t doubt that it would be very helpful.  I did find that one of the frequencies marked for use in focus, made me tense and gave me a headache so experiment and listen to your body.",Relax Melodies

4,2019-12-07 03:16:16,"I love this app and it helps me sleep. I just really miss how I could preset the timer to have the sound go off at a specific time, usually a few minutes before my alarm.

When I was charged, I went back and looked at the different prices for what was being offered. No where on the prices was a listing of $60 that I was charged.

The sounds are mostly good, with few exceptions, but I can’t give 5 stars to an app that keeps the best ones for money. If you’re a free app, don’t hoard the good stuff for subscription members.

5,2018-08-15 01:29:40,"This app is great! I love being able to customize my own sounds. Excellent for background noise when I’m writing, or peaceful noise when I’m drifting off to sleep. I love the sleep timer feature as well, helps me keep track of how long I’ve been writing and helps when drifting off to sleep.",Awesome App for Creative Thinkers
5,2018-08-01 19:41:21,This app has been a wonderful sleep tool. There are several different sounds to choose from and you can custom tune the volume level to your liking. There are so many different sounds to select you can truly have your own unique mix. Highly recommend. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,💤
5,2018-07-24 17:11:33,I am really enjoying this app. I love the ability to combine sounds easily. There are many different themes to choose from even if one does not pay for the pro version.

5,2018-07-20 14:24:37,"My family uses this app when we are traveling. I’m never going to sleep as well in a hotel as I do at home, but this helps a lot. I also like the timer feature — we set it for eight hours. Now, when I wake up in our darkened room, if the app is done running, I know it is time to get up!",Good timer
5,2018-07-14 04:22:54,"Really am surprised at how much free content there is - I may end up buying this one. Highly recommend even though I don’t use nightly.

5,2018-07-01 14:49:09,I sleep like a baby with this app and I don’t wake up until morning and I feel great. Whenever I’m down or stressed I use it and it calms me down and I feel relaxed.

5,2018-06-18 04:45:00,"I have always had trouble getting enough sleep, but I’ve always been skeptical about using soothing music to help.

1,2018-06-21 02:29:49,"I also used this app for years, had paid for the full version long ago, and recommended it more times than I can count. The updated version lost all of my saved mixes and can’t save any new. Not all of the sounds are included anymore and when I chose the option to download them, nothing happens. What I had assumed was bad programming bugs that would be fixed appears to be how they want things to work, so I am deleting and will not be recommending this app any longer.",Loved it for years but no longer
5,2018-06-17 23:26:37,"I'm so serious when I say I can't live with out the app! It's peace and sound mute with the touch of a button and it's free! I love the sound of the rain!

5,2018-06-06 15:18:49,"This was once the best but lately whenever I use it an annoying pop up opens my browser and stops this program. Sure, I could win $1000 if I’d just accept but I’d really rather sleep. I was thinking about going with the pro version but I’m not sure I trust them anymore. I do not trust their advertisers.",Not Good
5,2018-06-04 09:39:18,"Using this app is genuinely the only way I can get to sleep when insomnia strikes.

These relaxing sounds effectively replace the nerve wracking sounds of an airplane so I can actually fall asleep!  Love it!!!",Very soothing
5,2018-05-30 06:15:46,"I didn't think I'd like to sleep with headphones in. Living near a highway, that quickly became necessary. I bought the app and haven't regretted my decision once.

5,2018-05-12 04:22:18,"I love this app!  There are only a handful of apps I use daily...my calendar, bank, weather, and Relax Melodies.  It’s awesome that you can layer sounds.

5,2018-04-21 23:04:20,"I’ve had the premium version awhile.  I have a difficult time getting to sleep. This app is great. I found that listening to the same music night after night, after a while doesn’t do the trick. This give me a very large number of sounds to choose from.",Great sounds
5,2018-04-15 17:30:20,"Great app! Love the versatility and it doesn't use a lot of battery either. I love that it allows you to choose as many sounds as you want, and volume for each one too.

5,2018-04-10 07:51:46,This ap is user friendly with a ton of options and sounds that help to get you relaxed.

I recommend spending the extra money to get the additional meditations also!!,Great app
5,2018-04-04 04:54:00,I love the fact that you can mix your own sounds to get the perfect combination of sounds that work best for you. To add the meditation sessions are absolutely amazing!

5,2017-12-20 03:31:50,Been able to get into a deep sleep for longer since using this app. I am very great full for that.  I would love to have a timer for it that way it can shut off before I need to wake up.  Other then that it is fantastic. Lots of sounds so you can make a very good and unique bed time sound.,Sleep tight
4,2018-02-28 13:16:07,"It's fun to use and has all the bells and whistles you'd want in a relaxing sounds app: a sleep timer to fall asleep to waves or rain or whatever you like, a nightstand clock, and an alarm to wake to birdsong or zen flute or dozens of other choices. I just use the free version, as the ""pro"" sounds look to be mostly electronica which I personally don't find at all relaxing.",Intuitive interface
5,2017-12-03 15:43:46,Use this app for both myself and my baby now. It works like a charm in keeping him sleep during his naps and I night. I can get things done around the house without disturbing him now. I love it! Wish it didn’t have a monthly cost for the Pro. If it was a one time fee I would def buy it.,Bought it for my baby
5,2017-12-01 23:04:55,Love this. Especially the night sounds and thunder as well as the fact that you control the volume of each sound and can combine them. I set the timer for 30 minutes and I am asleep before it quits. Been having trouble sleeping...still awake in 2 or 3 hours. Love this app!!!,Best sounds app in the App Store!!!

5,2017-10-29 16:09:08,"Was about to get a sound machine which I really did not want but needed something to help drown out noises from neighbors who had a much earlier schedule than I.

5,2017-09-17 02:33:23,I downloaded this app while traveling because we are use to a loud fan at home. The hotel we stayed in was noisy and it made it difficult to rest.

5,2017-08-04 18:30:46,"I am relatively new to the app, but so far the wonderful array of sounds is my favorite part.

5,2023-08-08 08:21:11,This app is just wonderful for creating music and sounds to fall asleep and sleep to. I love also all the options for noise and other great stuff for meditation and relaxation. I have never been disappointed to renew my subscription for 2 years now.,Awesome sleep app!
3,2023-08-23 13:20:26,"This app has the best selection of high quality sounds, and the best sound mixing. But it is a pain to use. There are so many layers of features that it’s hard to navigate and inefficient. It’s also slow to load. I wish they had a lightweight version for people who just want the same 3 sounds every night.","Bloated app, complicated user interface"

I am falling asleep more quickly, sleeping better, and the brainwave frequency feature has helped me improve my focus on task I typically find difficult.",Really helpful
4,2023-08-03 12:29:42,Overall this app is really great. It has some cool features. But some of the sounds that are included with premium shouldn’t be in premium because they are basic sounds and it kinda frustrating that you can’t use them without paying for them.,Better sleep review
5,2023-07-27 13:11:12,I love this app and recommend  It to everyone. I use River for sound next to my bed. I do meditations and I also listen to the stories.

5,2023-03-10 04:38:34,"Love the option for sounds and it actually works! Interested to try more like how the military trains you to fall Asleep in 2 minutes, but right now I can say the focus variety and the fall asleep quickly track are spot on.",I was skeptical but…. Wow
5,2023-02-24 12:04:10,"I’m loving the mediation/hypnosis features!  Big improvements since I first used the app!  However, I am disappointed that meditation minutes are not pushed to Apple Health to track overall recovery better.",Wish it pushed meditation minutes to Apple Health
1,2023-02-27 07:05:15,"I used to love this. Used it every night. I noticed that the number of free sounds was going down, but it was okay. Nothing too bad. But tonight, I made the mistake of closing a sound, and when I went to turn it back on again, I noticed it was locked. I checked sounds I used to listen to, all locked. I found 3 sounds and no music that were free. I loved this app. Developers if you read this, please, don’t make us pay for our sleep.",This app is no longer what is used to be
5,2023-02-14 00:45:47,This app has great sounds and is easy to use. Plus there’s great customer service/support. They listened to their users and added a switch that can allow it to play in the background behind other apps. Great app!,Plays behind other Apps!

2,2022-03-10 04:50:50,"Almost everything is locked (didn’t use to be this way) unless you pay the 60$. Totally powered by greed at this point.

5,2018-11-19 04:57:08,"The app has a variety of sounds to choose from. I love that I can mix them together as well - if I want city ambience with rainfall, I can! Relaxing lullaby and gentle wind? You got it! I usually connect it to my Bluetooth speaker at night and sleep a blissful sleep uninterrupted by outside noises. I’ve been using it for years and love it!",Love this app!!
5,2018-10-28 16:55:05,"Many quality sounds are available for free to select and combine together to customize your own unique listening experience for sleep, relaxation or background noise. Also a wide range of sounds and music is available for small purchase. Great App!",Quality Sound App
5,2018-10-25 12:37:32,This app is easy to use and lets you mix and match sounds. I use it when I forget my white noise machine when I travel. I use other sounds I’m trying to study in public or at home and now I use it to help my son sleep when I’m going to be making noises. Simple. Free. A lot of choices. Can’t go wrong!,Easy
5,2018-10-11 20:33:58,"I tried the meditations and music provided throughout the night. I suffered from chronic insomnia from complex post traumatic stress and am unable to take medications due to sensitivities. I rely on natural means to help me rest. Prior to subscribing I used various meditations available free on you tube. However, this one has been the most effective.   Thank you!",Review
5,2018-09-26 00:15:02,"Besides having a ton of sounds you can blend you own favorites. I very much enjoy the meditation feature. I use it before sleep and on stressful days. I also use the timer. Sometimes I don’t fall asleep in 10 minutes, so I change the sound slightly.",More than I expected
3,2018-10-03 22:29:49,I love this app. I use it every night to help me sleep. The app itself is great and has lots to choose from. My issue is with the fact that they have turned a lot of the sounds I used and love into Pro sounds. If you want to create new sounds and make them pro that’s fine but don’t make already existing sounds Pro. It makes me very mad that I am expected to pay for things That used to be free.,Love it But Frustrated
5,2018-09-22 08:26:23,There are quite a few options of sounds to choose from. I love how you can pick your own mix and put different sounds together. I got the free version and it works great! If there were other sounds you wanted then you could always pay for it.,Very relaxing!
5,2018-09-07 06:04:49,This app has so many sounds! You can combine them and mix the volume for the multiple sounds you use at once. It is seriously incredible. I use it for my baby continually while out in public so she will sleep long and well. I love this app! I even use it for myself!,Incredible sound machine
5,2018-08-31 11:26:51,"This app was very helpful for my insomnia! Sometimes you just need your brain to focus on something simple, easy, and consistent rather than race with a million thoughts out of your control. The extensive library of sounds with this app offers you a way to focus and calm your brain to help you drift to sleep.",Sleep!
5,2018-08-28 05:31:40,I love love this app. Some nights I can just not fall asleep so that is when I break out this app with the calming sounds and meditation and I am out like a light. I have been looking for an app that helps me sleep and I have tried multiple different ones. This is by far my favorite.,Only thing that gets me to sleep!
5,2018-08-25 03:03:56,I love this app because it helps me fall asleep and it doesn’t make you pay for the majority of the sound and you can mix sounds there is a timer so your device isn’t going off all night and it is just awesome! I definitely recommend getting this app!,This is the best!
5,2018-08-19 11:10:19,"I got this for myself originally, and it was nice to listen to. However, since having a baby, it’s super helpful when the little one has trouble falling asleep! Features like the fan can make it sound like our normal sleeping area wherever we are. Highly recommend.",Very helpful for baby
5,2018-08-16 18:50:10,"I Love these melodies so much as they have been giving my children more peaceful sleep at night. As soon as I began playing the sounds, our favorites being “at sea” and “eternity” so far, they are off into deep sleep and works like a charm! Thank You for this wonderful app! We are resting better and awakening more restored.",My Children
5,2018-07-12 00:03:25,"Easy enough to use. Lots of choices. I like being able to mix and match different noises however I see fit. No noticeable drop off in noise when the track loops. I'm surprised this quality is free! UPDATE: seems to have developed a pause every once in a while, a little annoying.",Great noise app
3,2018-07-23 10:57:31,"I’ve had this app for over two years now, and absolutely love it. I like it so much, that I bought a monthly pass for the extra sounds, and I enjoyed them very much! I decided to buy the life long package, and sorry to say it bluntly, but I think $100 US is a VERY unnecessary price for some nice sounds on an app. I’ve bought the life term package, but for a lot of people I think that this is way too much of a stretch.",Too much money
5,2018-07-08 06:13:32,"I’ve been having a bit of insomnia recently so I downloaded the free version of this and created a few sound mixes. They’re helping me get my sleep back! I can imagine that some of these nature sounds or white noise are great to have in the background while working, reading or meditating.",So nice as a sleep aid
5,2018-06-28 12:22:02,I use to have to stay up until I was so tired I could finally fall asleep. This app has such a variety of combinable high quality sounds that I now look forward to a regular (& earlier) bedtime. The meditations and trainings are more than a bonus to the sleep programs. It was worth the lifetime fee.,Works!
4,2018-07-03 21:08:54,"I am actually downloaded this some months ago, and I have to say since then they have made many improvements. I I am very impressed with the range of sounds and the ease with which they can be blended together to create a custom soundscape. The price is for a bit on the high side for my taste and I will have to decide whether the program is worth it.",Impressive
5,2018-06-25 05:29:49,I have anxiety and depression and have trouble falling asleep. This helps me get outside of my thoughts long enough to relax and fall asleep. I love the timer option because having it on all night would prevent me from staying asleep but 30 minutes is usually long enough for me to fall asleep,Very helpful for anxiety
5,2018-06-18 20:35:14,"This app has all bases covered. Whether I'm soothing my exhausted but worked up baby, or need to meditate for a few minutes myself, this app helps to create the ideal auditory environment.  Plus, being able to mix the individual sounds at varying volumes provides the solution needed for every situation.",Perfect for every situation
5,2018-06-10 03:31:11,"What i love about this app is your sound is customizable. It can be all nature sounds, musical, or a combination of both. I fall asleep with these sounds playing all the time. This is one of the few apps id actually spend money on to unlock the premium sounds too",Been using this app for years
5,2018-06-06 16:49:06,"This app is user friendly and has alot of different combinations that allow the user to create unique sounds unlike any other app i have used to fall asleep with. Its great to use to help you focus, or to meditate, or even sleep with. Definitely keeping this app on my phone and plan to use nightly 👍",Very soothing
5,2018-06-04 10:17:05,I have always had a really bad anxiety before going to sleep or even just throughout the day. Every time  time that happens I turn on Relax Melodies and I meditate and close my eyes and try to sleep. It has really helped me with my anxiety and helped me get my sleep to wake up for early mornings .Definitely five stars!,Relaxing melodies does its name !
5,2018-06-04 04:14:12,"This helps me fall asleep and stay asleep. The app is simple to use, yet there are great features. You can make your own custom melodies and save them. Adjust the sound on each sound you implement (love this). Set a timer or an alarm. So many cool features. This is a life saver and my family is happy I am getting sleep.",Love it
5,2018-05-29 10:59:44,"I use this app every night ! It helps me a lot to fall asleep. I tried a lot of different methods, and white noise is the best. This app in particular help me get a sound that works best for me :) much better than any pre-set music, where there is always things that bug me or doesn’t work for me.",Help me sleep !! The best white noise app
5,2018-05-29 00:37:28,"It's made my ""me time"" so relaxing and helps me fall asleep right away. I have been using it non-stop. I love that I can customize my own music and share it as well. I wish I could see others' creations more frequently. I couldn't resist the full version and glad to have spent that extra money.",My fav app!!
5,2018-05-23 07:38:32,"This app is awesome!  Whenever I use it, I get a great night’s sleep. This morning, I woke up early and couldn’t get back to sleep. I had turned the app off when I woke up, thinking I would have no trouble falling back to sleep. I finally turned the app back on and was asleep shortly after. Thank you!",My favorite sleep app!
5,2018-05-21 01:46:08,I use this to create a peaceful atmosphere for sleep. It is a lot of fun to create your own sound mixes. This app has a lot of variety within certain categories.. want heavy rain? Check. Rain with echoes in a cavern? Yes.   They also share combos by other members if you're not sure about creating your own.,Great relaxation tool
5,2018-05-20 07:18:10,"I love the diversity of sounds in the library to customize your experience. I think it’s what makes this app so beautiful. However, some of the sounds won’t even function. It’s like they’re unpressable.  I purchased the lifetime premium package thinking it might help but unfortunately it didn’t. I can’t play several sounds such as Heavy Rain, Storm, Underwater, Cat Purring, Fire Crackles, etc.  I wish I could give it 5 stars as I think it’s a wonderful app. Just fix these kinks.  EDIT: support reached out and it appears all sounds are working. Will update if something changes.",Versatility. However Some Sounds Won’t Play.
5,2018-05-19 06:19:12,I love listening to sound like the rain when falling asleep. I used a plug in sound machine for years. This app allows so many options for layering or individual sounds. I love the musical aspect also. Makes me feel like I am at a massage or in a spa!  I think I will upgrade and buy the entire version. It's been super!,Love it!!!
5,2018-05-16 04:49:47,"Practically limitless number of combinations, very high quality sounds, and even meditation now? Cool! Also used as my morning alarm which allows me to wake to different sounds. This app just does everything!! It's the best. Look no further. Already tried a lot! Love this app. Can't sleep without it.",Still the best.
5,2018-04-30 02:06:22,I was recommended this app from a friend because I told her I had very bad sleeping problems from waking up eight times a night for the bathroom runs or the horrible nightmares I’ve been getting. This app is the best because I literally fell asleep within the 30 minutes that I set the timer for!,im 23 weeks pregnant
5,2018-04-22 15:22:49,This app has made all the difference for me! We have two preschoolers who enjoy staying awake late. With the help of this app I can get them settled down and asleep in under fifteen minutes rather than the usual hour (ugh!). It’s also great for me when I need to take some self-care time away from it all. A+++ for awesome!!,Awesome App!!!
5,2018-04-22 04:33:27,Every time I have trouble going to bed I just put on this app and it puts me right to sleep. I suggest sometimes doing the meditation part if you have had a stress full day. Overall I really enjoy this app and if you have a hard time falling asleep or staying asleep you would really like this.,Works well
5,2018-04-16 08:51:42,"No other sleep app save for ones made by the same company have the features this one has. Main pluses is the ability to play in the background, playing multiple sounds of your choosing, and adjusting volumes for each sound.",Without a doubt the best
5,2018-01-26 02:57:11,I downloaded this app because my counsler recommended it for me.I have depression and find it hard to sleep I also have panic attacks and this has helped with both of my problems. This app has helped me calm back down after my attacks and also to sleep quicker. I hope they add more sound affects❤️,Relaxing 😆
5,2017-12-22 06:13:01,"This app has helped me to feel relaxed and fall asleep on nights that I’m having difficulty falling asleep. I typically can’t sleep with any noise(tv, music, etc) but for some reason this app isn’t a noise that keeps me up, its moreso a healing noise/sound(if that makes sense). I highly recommend this app!",Wish I found this app sooner!
4,2017-12-31 10:08:05,"Pros: many sounds to choose from and very customizable, timers to shut off and/or exit app, reasonably priced Cons: guided meditations are only okay... not outstanding... and somewhat inconsistent at times, would like more extended musical tones... long and flowing... that don’t repeat so quickly (can become irritating instead of soothing on such short loops)","Still happy with my purchase, even with quirks"
5,2017-12-03 00:51:12,"There are many great apps out there, but this one by far super cedes them all! This is absolutely great for meditation. They have these sounds that you can put together to create a great meditative and relaxing experience. This would be great for those with anxiety, those who are sleep deprived and people having trouble with concentrating.",Get The App
5,2017-08-26 01:25:26,"We love this app! The sounds can be blended to a specific mix, which is great when catering for different needs. Favorites mixes can be saved for use later on.

4,2017-10-12 22:03:04,"Loved this app so much! I used this connected to Bluetooth too help my baby nap, I loved it because it's a non stop commercial free sound and you can combine different sounds, but ever since rating it and updating it glitches, it either stops playing or keeps asking for another review to unlock a sound. I wish I never updated. :'(",Edit: WAS Perfect for baby!
5,2017-08-20 21:05:18,We downloaded this app for a long car ride with our twin four year olds. Little did we know it would become one of our most frequented apps for both our kids and ourselves. It has such a wide variety of great soothing sounds that are perfect for every age!,Kids and parents love this!!
5,2017-08-13 04:37:37,I enjoy this app quite a bit. I like the distinction between frogs and peepers. Anyone who has grown up in rural areas and slept with the windows open during the summers know there is a huge difference. Having the timer allows for now draining your phone battery all night. Overall good sound/sleep app!,Good app
5,2017-08-12 18:36:50,"I absolutely love this app! For years the last thing I do before I close my eyes is open the app to 'River'. It's a lovely calming water sound that acts as white noise, and puts me right to sleep. What's a great bonus is that as soon as he hears this sound, my darling -though sometimes hyper- dog knows it's time to mellow out and he puts himself to bed.:)",It even calms my dog!
5,2017-07-17 05:11:52,This app will ease your mind and allow you too sleep peacefully with all the white music and sounds.

And I recommend it to anyone who has trouble settling down and relaxing to fall asleep like me.,Omg
5,2017-07-08 05:54:08,Has proved to be really helpful with relaxing me. I also use it to put children to sleep. It has a mixing board; you can lower the volume on one sound and increase the volume of another sound to give you the right mix of sounds that happen to fit your preference that night.,Great app!
5,2017-07-01 09:34:46,The design of the app makes it extremely easy to use and all of the options available can be used to create the perfect environment for sleeping. I highly recommend this app to anyone that has problems with sleeping due to tinnitus or other issues.,Great App Really Helps With My Sleep Issues
5,2023-11-02 15:41:00,"Years ago I bought the lifetime membership, which have access to additional features over and above the free version. Why am I being prompted to renew?",Why am I being prompted to pay for another year of premium even I paid for life?
5,2023-10-28 14:25:38,I love this app. You can make up all kinds of sounds that please you for any situation you are in. I love the rain and thunder selections together and I fall asleep to them most every night. The purring cat is so real. The meditations are really great too. Definitely a great app to have. 5 Stars from me!,Relax Melodies
5,2023-09-15 02:41:24,I’ve been a user of this app for many years!! Haven’t missed a night using it since I downloaded the app. It genuinely helps me wind down at night and sets me into a deep slumber. It’s great for meditation as well. I will use this app for many many years to come.,Appreciation review
5,2023-08-27 04:20:21,"Love the app so much, only thing i’d prefer is for there to be a way to buy specific sounds, i want a few that are premium but i don’t need all the other ones and i’m not looking for another subscription. Would love to see it",Best app for rain noise
5,2023-08-12 09:16:49,"I have been using thls Better Sleep app for many years.  It makes me sleep deep and trained my brain to calm down so I can get quality rest and sleep.  It’s amazing you can mix sounds and customize it!  It’s user friendly, download it NOW!💙",This app will help you sleep!
5,2023-08-10 16:41:46,"I work the night and have difficulty sleeping during the day, so I need a dark room with sounds to muffle the outside noises to relax my mind.

5,2023-07-28 09:56:39,I am so happy to have found Better Sleep! The sleep stories are interesting enough to prevent my mind from dwelling on anxious thoughts and are told in such soothing ways that I am usually sound asleep within 15 minutes. I highly recommend.,Instant Sleep

5,2023-01-26 14:20:54,Bettersleep’s customizable mixes allowed me to create sounds that fit my moods and improved my focus. Their deep focus playlist combined with the focus Hz really did help me focus better! I had solid focus for 4 hours with minimal distractions by listening to it. Can’t say enough good things about it!,Amazing!
5,2022-11-26 04:57:15,Not expecting a whole lot but frankly surprised at the detail allowed to the user to custom create their own environments. Actually a great application for any smart phone. It definitely helps clear my mind so I can get some rest.,Better than expected
4,2023-01-11 03:45:24,I rated this a 4 because I love the sounds but on the sleep journal recordings you have to have premium to listen to it and I want to be able to listen to that to see what I was doing or saying in the middle of the night. But overall this is a really good sleep app and I love it and use it every night,Not to bad
5,2022-11-25 08:09:57,"I’ve been a troubled sleeper since I was a kid. Now, as an adult with chronic pain and continuing insomnia, sleep is hard to come by.

4,2022-11-12 02:32:21,"It was nice in 2017… but now I feel like this app should support Siri.  *EDIT(S)*  I still really like this app though. I found it on an old iPad and then in 2021 I tried to find it and I was so happy that I found it. Now there are a million updates and I feel like soon I won’t even know how to use it, no offense though.",I loved it back in 2017…
4,2022-10-30 06:45:15,I’ve had breathing problems mixed with sleep apnea at times. It helped me to hear a 30-minute recording of the sounds that I make while asleep. I needed to hear them to know my plans with my doctor are on track. I’m a wee bit stubborn but this app convinced me of what I need to take care of.,Learning about my breathing while asleep
4,2022-10-18 03:50:27,I originally gave it 5 stars but when I lock my phone this weird clapping sound occurs. If I leave my screen unlocked I don’t have this issue. Kinda inconvenient because I have to leave my phone open all night. Will change to 5 stars if the issue is fixed.,Could be 5 star
5,2022-10-12 03:39:50,"I struggle with insomnia. I haven’t used this app for long, but so far I feel like it’s working!

5,2022-10-06 22:43:58,Has a lot of great sounds that you can make your own mix with. Unfortunately a lot of them are only available through paid version but the ones that are free are very relaxing. It works well and I dozed off fairly easily,Great!
5,2022-09-26 04:32:49,My roommate uses this app and I admit at first I was skeptical and it took some adjustment.  There are plenty of ways to control just how much of each sound you hear and set a timer if you just want this to get you to sleep. 5 stars!,Best thing since bedtime stories!
5,2022-09-13 02:03:27,I love this app! It allows you to create a unique sleep soundtrack. It also enables you to not only mix the different sounds but also the levels of each sound and set a timer. I highly recommend everyone try this app!,Amazing App

5,2022-07-17 05:07:29,Love that in the app you can create your own sounds that include multiple layers + have adjustable volumes on each sound.  It makes it so incredibly enjoyable to use!  Also great that you even have access to Solfeggio frequencies to layer in your sounds.,Fantastic app
5,2022-06-09 00:33:06,I really liked this app because it gives so much music and effort and even poetry just to satisfy costumers. The only thing that frustrated me is that you can’t do much without the pass. But it’s a great app thanks to the BetterSleep team to make such a good app,Very well put together
5,2022-04-23 08:11:08,"I was having a stressful night and a very hard time sleeping- but I turned on this app after not using it for awhile and it helped me feel so much better and calmer, and it helped me sleep! Totally recommend",Great app! Totally recommend when your stressed

4,2022-04-19 04:36:21,"I like the app, I really do. My only problem is that they allow you to record what goes on while you’re sleeping, but they don’t let you listen to it unless you wanna pay for it🤔?

5,2021-06-21 09:46:55,It saves the day when I’m not sleeping at home and the fan is not an option. I also love the variety of free sounds and the ability to save your favorite mix. Just an all around good app to have if you have sleeping or relaxation issues.,A complete savior
5,2021-03-19 04:54:46,I love subtle noise when going to sleep. With this app you have the ability to combine multiple sounds (such as rain and thunder). You can create the perfect sound for the perfect sleep! I also love that the free options are still so plentiful without having to spend money on “good” sounds.,Best Sound App
3,2021-06-02 03:33:04,"The app is pretty good as far as choices of sounds, meditations, stories and music.  My biggest complaint is that the app glitches out during the night sometimes. It will stop playing, when you go to start it up the play list you listening to will be gone. So you got to open the app find the playlist and put it back on- at 3am.",Pretty okay
5,2021-02-08 15:38:45,"This app works, I didn’t expect to work for me personally because I have Insomnia and can never fall asleep when it’s time to go to bed. I’d recommend to use if you can’t wind down to go to sleep like you used to. This will definitely get you back on your sleeping schedule.",Back on A Sleeping Routine
5,2020-09-04 02:48:57,"I’ve used this app for years. Now I can’t use it because it shuts off after about 30 seconds of playing, every time. Still works on my 2018 iPad Pro fine but no longer on my iPhone X.",Broken after update
5,2020-05-28 10:33:23,"When I first purchased this app, I found there to be somewhat of a variety of voices. It seems like just about anything that is new has the same reader. Unfortunately, for me, her sound is not relaxing. Please include some additional voices for new content.",Would like a variety of voices for meditating
4,2020-09-03 03:35:12,I always fall asleep easily with this on but whenever I’m sleeping it cuts off randomly so I deleted the app and re-downloaded it again it didn’t do the same thing again until the next night. Can you please fix the app so I won’t have to restart my phone so many times?   Thank you,Great for sleep but it keeps cutting off
5,2020-04-22 21:53:08,Relax melodies has helped me fall asleep much quicker. The different combinations of sounds and music are wonderful. I enjoy being able to create my own mixes and save them. I also like the timer and alarm features. This application has so much more than just sleep sounds.,One of the best
5,2020-04-22 01:55:42,I think Relax Melodies is a great app and really helps me fall asleep.  The courses are very relaxing and soothing.  A lot of the courses were VIP and you had to buy.  But I enjoyed the non VIP ones very much.  I strongly recommend this app if you have trouble sleeping or if you just want to meditate or relax.,Strongly Recommend
3,2020-02-21 04:26:24,"The product has been great but gets less so with each new version .  The newer the version the less free sounds and then they move the alarm to where you can’t get to it from the main page, next came the splash logo with music which is the last thing I want at night especially if I’m trying to not wake my wife.",More changes = less user friendly
5,2019-11-18 05:33:50,"This app is exactly what I need. I live in a noisy house and have tried EVERYTHING to help fall asleep and stay asleep - rain noise, white noise, etc...but I am a really light sleeper and both are too harsh for me on their own.

5,2019-05-14 13:44:49,I was skeptical about sound helping me get to sleep. This app proved me wrong. The ability to choose a combination of sounds and mix the volumes of each is terrific.  I quickly found a surprisingly soothing mix and set a 20 minute timer. I was fast asleep long before the sounds ended. Great app!!,Love the Sound Mixer!
5,2019-05-03 01:24:20,"Not a night goes by that I don’t use this app. It has so many features that you can get for free its beyond worth downloading!

5,2019-04-30 04:10:54,I give this app 5 stars because i love how even though i have the free version there are still so many options to choose from. And that you are able to make your own combo's. This app definitly deserves 5 stars and you should definitly check it out if you havent already.,Its amazing
5,2019-04-25 02:18:38,I love this app because sometimes I am trying to go to sleep but can’t. I toss and turn all night. Then I pull up relax melodies and feel way better. I just put it under my pillow and listen to the soothing sounds. Had this app for 2 years now and I still love it. Get it and you will not regret it.,Great app
5,2018-12-11 03:25:01,"Amazing set of sounds! Being able to combine several to make a perfect, unique mix that puts you at ease for bed is wonderful.

They were...until the updates ( which are on a regular basis) took away things like my paid lifetime subscription. I paid for the full app and had to work to restore my subscription after each update. However, the most recent update wiped my payment history.  They also removed medications for sleep. Not worth the money now",Relaxation help for sleep
5,2018-12-04 02:22:08,"this is the BEST app to exist! but there DOES need a MAJOR improvement (but nonetheless it's fantastic)! the issue with this is that u have to pay for stuff, i kno that u guys r trying to make young moolah, but if u want people to ADORE this app (and want people to NOT be restless) u shouldn't make people pay!

4,2018-12-06 09:48:20,"I use this app daily to help get myself to sleep. It usually works!

Since I haven’t paid, there's a limited amount of sounds I can use but regardless I highly recommend this app for sleeping!","Helpful,but could use more variety"
5,2018-11-28 14:55:57,The app is great. It has many sound options that can be layered with separate volume settings as well. Works great for going to sleep with setting the timer to shut off the app once the time is up. All while your phone is in rest mode!,Highly recommend
4,2018-12-02 10:36:52,"I love this ap because it is versatile. It has the meditation guidance as well as the relaxing sounds. My favorite are thunderstorm, rain on roof and distant train. I play them together and go right to sleep. I used to listen to talk radio but the news definitely did not help me sleep. Relax melodies does the trick. Now I find I've been using it during the day as well, just to help me relax.",Relax Melodies
5,2018-11-23 06:21:28,I LOVE all of the rain and thunder sounds.  I sleep with them every night; when I wake up in the middle of the night they lull me right back to sound slumber. This is the best non-prescriptive sleep aid I have found.  I really like how you can layer the sounds — so soothing and personal.  It’s my nightly go-to routine now.,I can finally sleep
5,2018-11-02 00:30:14,This app is amazing. You customize the sounds to your own personal preferences. The possibilities are endless. Each sound I create is related to a different feeling or situation. So when I’m in one of those moods then I play that particular sound. So far I’ve been very happy with this app.,I love the different soundscapes!
5,2018-10-30 15:11:58,Sleeping thru the night now. I was waking up every couple of hours and having a hard time getting back to sleep. Feeing tired and yawning all day at work. I love being able to customize the different sounds to create my own blend of music to get me to sleep faster. Thank you!,Thanks! Love this app!
1,2018-10-30 22:45:24,"Initially, l liked this app so much that l spent $20 on 4/9/18 for an 'annual' upgrade to the PRO level. It was great, until 3 or 4 weeks ago, when l was suddenly and mysteriously downgraded and no longer had access to the PRO meditations, despite the fact that l had paid for them! So l paid for a year of PRO, but only received 5-6 months of it. I am very disappointed that l did not receive what was promised at the time of the upgrade. Do not waste your money, unless you don't mind flushing your hard-earned cash down the toilet!!!",Don't upgrade to Pro
5,2018-10-26 10:56:17,Helps me go to sleep every night. Even has a timer to play for as long as you want. Mine is set for 30 min and I have only been awake by the end once in 9 months. I previously frequently took over an hour to fall asleep. I definitely recommend this to everyone!,Sleep Sensei

5,2018-10-18 14:01:28,This app is by far the best on the market! You can do so so much with this app. I play it through Bluetooth at work and have it as background noise.

5,2018-10-14 14:47:06,This app makes you so relaxed. I use the icy snow with the thunderstorm since you can mix sounds together. It really relaxes me so I can fall asleep. You can also add a timer so that it will stop once you are asleep. I even use this app when I’m not sleeping so I can always here the sound of rain! It makes me happy!,Great relaxed app
1,2018-10-15 04:29:33,"This was my go-to app for years, both for sleep sounds, and for ease- in pre-alarm sounds. I've had to stop using it since the latest update because it's now sucking 61% of my battery, and the morning sounds don't work anymore. I just paid for my year's subscription, but I'm thinking about just cancelling it, since I can't find a fix myself and can't get the owner to answer my help questions.

4,2018-09-21 10:00:41,"There are lots of different sound  options such as: urban rain, peepers, waterfall, campfire, etc.  There is a timer you can set when it exits out of the app so you don't kill your battery life.

5,2017-11-02 05:24:35,"Just had white noise apps recommended to me and have played with a few.  This is my very favorite!!  Lots of free sounds and music options, plus upgrade capability, with the ability to set the volume for each sound when making a mix.  Love it!",Exactly what I didn’t know I wanted
2,2017-11-11 07:49:05,"It’s okay when it’s working, but it keeps having issues. Some nights it crashes repeatedly to the point where it is unusable! I paid $20 for the premium account. A complete waste of money if it’s not working! Get it together already! Hire some real developers please! The high school computer science club that volunteered to develop this app had a great start, but at some point you need to pay professionals to have a product worth paying for...",Keeps crashing!
5,2017-09-20 22:38:00,Enough variety without duplicating things. Enough customization that it's easy to understand options. I've enjoyed this app for a few iterations. I was only going to give it a 4 because of the pro price but for what you get with the basic I had to give it 5.,Just right...
5,2017-07-11 04:46:30,"I often have trouble falling asleep and even when I finally sleep I frequently wake tired and grumpy. No longer, first time I used the app was for a nap I used the 30 min timer and laid down next thing I know I'm waking up feeling like I slept all night but it was only the thirty minutes. Absolutely incredible!!!",Best Ever
5,2017-06-29 11:12:48,"This app offers a variety of peaceful sounds to fall asleep to. App also offers the option to automatically exit after 30 minutes. The only thing I wish is that the premium wasted so expensive, but other than that, the free version is great.",Relaxing!
4,2017-06-20 04:22:53,So far this app is great. I've fallen asleep to a few of the ocean and rain sounds as well as the night sounds ones (that's my favorite). I usually have a hard time falling asleep so this is nice. Plus when I wake up in the middle of the night it doesn't go off on its own so I can still hear the soothing sounds I fell asleep to and they put me back to sleep!,Love so far
4,2017-06-18 05:10:40,"It's a well designed app with high quality sounds and a wide variety of sounds, but $10 a month or $20-30 for a full version is completely insane. By all means download it and enjoy the rather large amount of free stuff, but competing apps like Rain Rain are a far better deal ($2-5) for a very similar product.","Good app, bad pricing, good sound selection"
5,2017-06-15 02:10:24,"So many sounds and the ability to create your own melody by using several different sounds, truly wonderful. I love how you can take one sound and only have it faint in the background and then another sound almost takeover! I just wish there was a snoring sound!",Perfect
5,2017-06-10 11:34:21,Very impressed with this app. The sounds are high quality and make for the perfect relaxing background. What really makes this app stand out though is the ability to layer the sounds. And being able to save your own personal blends is the cream on top.,Perfect background sounds
5,2023-10-26 06:06:51,I've been using this app for quite a while now. I have experienced very few problems. I'm also happy to see that they've never charged me for anything I did not want. I'll keep using this app for a long time.,Enjoyable & Accountable
3,2023-11-04 03:24:05,"My kids and I truly love the app and the stores. We have been using it for 13 months. However, it only works 60% of the time. We are big internet household with games and lots of apps and this is the only one I have issues with. When we try to use it and it only works 60% of the time, that’s a problem. If it works for you, it’s worth it!",Love app
5,2023-09-09 15:07:38,"It’s a must have for anyone who needs their mind to slow down to sleep. No other noise app, especially the oscillating fan, rain, and thunder noises, compares.  I’ve had this app over 5 years now and never sleep without it.",Can’t sleep without it
4,2023-10-15 16:46:06,"The app works well, but since yesterday, when I pressed the lightning bolt symbol for the smart mix, all sounds just went quiet. Please fix this because I really enjoyed this function and I think it’s essential for a lot of my mixes. I have already reached out to the in app support.",Problem with the smart mix
5,2023-09-02 01:54:19,Absolutely amazing. I think this is the only app that can make me fall asleep in under 30 minutes. I usually fall asleep around 45-50 minutes and this app has really changed it. Thank you so much for creating it 😭❤️,Literally the best app ever
5,2023-08-18 03:14:46,"For what they give for free is great and has good reminders because I surely lose track of time at night! Love it. I start a meditation and before I know, it’s the next day after a few deep breaths. This is truly an amazing app if you deal with anxiety and insomnia.",Great App! Definitely worth it!
2,2023-09-01 14:09:04,"This app has been great and I use it almost every night. I have a one year subscription premium subscription and just last night everything got locked. I’m not sure how to fix it, but I do know I probably won’t pay more money. It’s been nice, but in this economy I’m not paying a penny more to get all my mix’s unlocked. It’s been nice, but I can sleep without it if they are going to charge me more",I liked it until
5,2023-07-21 14:41:57,"I struggle with anxiety, depression and insomnia, and this is really help me sleep. unlike other apps that help me pay this one is different because some people can’t afford it so thank you you’ve helped me in so many ways so I’ll give you five stars.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🤩                        - Love unknown💜💙💚💛🧡❤️",👏👏👏 applause⭐️
3,2023-07-31 11:19:14,I love how I was given a free three day trial for premium and ive been sleeping so good with it the only problem is I can’t afford to pay for the full premium subscription so sadly I’ll only be able to listen to my favorite autumn music sound for two more days :( Other than that the app is great and has lots of free sounds that are also pretty relaxing,Premium benefits
5,2023-06-09 20:24:22,"This app has something for everyone.  The sounds are so authentic and soothing for whatever your mood.  Can’t sleep, set up your favorite playlist.  Great for when you are traveling and need a familiar sound.  I would not be without!",Amazing App
4,2023-06-21 03:43:27,"This app has been a go to app at night for sleep machine noises, though in the last week I can’t even get the app to open. The app is up to date, I’ve restarted my phone, tried at different times on different days, and still nothing. Hoping this gets fixed soon!",Bugs
5,2023-05-08 08:15:53,"This app is worth EVERY penny! That is if you decide to subscribe. I use it in my career as an esthetician during facials. I use it too fall asleep and leave it on all night! I even use it when I have anxiety! There are so many helpful stories, music, and sounds! Best app!!!",Best sound app ever!
4,2023-05-19 02:33:44,I would like to first say this app is good and I’ve been using it for some days now. But I don’t understand why I have to pay to be relaxed . The sounds that are free are really good for sleep . I want to be able to play something peaceful without paying for it. That’s all I have to say . It’s still a get app tho.,Good… But !
5,2023-02-15 18:15:57,I find that if I can’t stop thinking of what went on during the day and just can’t close my eyes I turn on the sleep app. and it always helps me shut it off relax close my eyes and go to sleep.,Find it hard to shut it off.
4,2023-02-24 07:00:33,The name of this app really isn’t that wrong. Since I’ve started using this app I’ve actually woken up feeling more refreshed than when I’d fall asleep with some Lo-fi playing. A few of the things are more distracting than calming (like the dream frequency that it has) but the other sounds are really nice,Better sleep
5,2023-01-25 05:42:35,Love the free options and I can purchase some of the others.  It was exactly what I needed.  I found some favorites and use it every night.  It especially helps when traveling with my pup.  It drowns out the noises of the hotel at night.  Works great!,Perfect!
1,2023-02-04 13:08:11,It started out pretty good. Now it does show the night just completed. Data is no longer saved or shown. For $40 which they charged me twice I have a crappy app which won’t do anything. Rereviewed  Now works not at all. I turn it on and it sets up as if it’s working then nothing. Every morning it restarts as if nothing happened the night before. I paid for a full year for this crap load of nothing. No one to contact no recourse. Don’t buy it.,Started out pretty good
5,2023-01-18 10:44:24,i was pretty skeptical bc i’ve tried a lot to improve my sleep & could never be successful with guided meditations nor did sound therapy seem to have an impact. app changed my life within my first time opening it. just try it,Actually works
5,2023-01-15 06:55:14,"Really calming, plays when you’re phone is off and it’s easy to use. I like that you don’t have to pay for the whole app to play the sounds, and you can do as many as you want at the same time. Def recommend 😁",Amazing!!
5,2022-12-31 10:11:20,This app has a great variety of sounds - even in the free version! It is so calming and helpful and has so many other options that I am seriously considering the paid version/subscription. Keep up the great work!,Love it! Even the free version is helpful
5,2022-12-29 14:48:01,Had a problem right off. Contacted support and they were fantastic. Problem got solved quickly. Lots of customizations to tailor it to my tastes. Highly recommend it.,Try it. You won’t be disappointed if you have problems sleeping.
5,2022-12-05 06:10:32,I have a hard time getting my brain to go to sleep. I have all these thoughts bouncing around in my head and they just won’t be quiet or go away. The Better Sleep app helps by helping to block the busy brain. I sleep much better now.,Very Soothing
5,2022-11-17 04:41:33,"This has been my favorite app so far. There are so many options you won’t get bored with any and I especially like that you can combine different sounds. I use this while studying, sleeping, and working. No ads or poor connection.",Love!
5,2022-10-18 03:11:10,Won’t open. Crashes immediately. Deleted and reinstalled. No help. Loved it until this happened.   Update fixed problem. Back to using every night.,Please test updates on actual phones
4,2022-10-18 08:03:51,App issues resolved quickly. Now I can get a good nights sleep again. I wish they offered more free sounds but it’s a great app and a good nights sleep is rough without it. Thanks.   App Instantly crashing. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but keeps crashing instantly upon opening.,Fixed Very Quickly
5,2022-07-11 20:50:53,"This is by far the best for sleep sounds and focus app. High quality recordings, you can create mixes across a variety of sounds, and there is some very background good music as well. The tones and binaural beats you can layer in also really help with relaxation and focus.",Great Sound App
4,2022-09-11 02:43:24,At least once a week I have to restore purchase to get my app fully functioning again. It wouldn’t be so annoying if it wasn’t 10:30 pm as I’m trying to get ready for sleep. I don’t know why it has been happening so often but I wish it would stop.,Great except resets to basic
5,2022-07-09 16:20:48,"Out of all of the sleep and focus sound apps, this is the best. Would like to see more mediation and focus type sounds with a more uplifting ambience than Zen and Astral, but that being said everything else is great. I love the tones and binaural beats that you can mix in.",Best Sleep Sound App Yet
5,2022-05-05 05:48:56,"I have had trouble sleeping for years, a lot of the reasoning being due to anxiety, and overthinking. Using this app has changed my mindset while falling asleep completely. I love the rain, and I love a little white noise, so having the rain and a calm asmr together has been so peaceful!",Love this app!
3,2022-05-06 01:21:25,I like the recorder but what I don’t like is that  the volume it’s either to loud or to low and mostly everything that I like is premium and I feel like it costs to much money just to listen to sounds I get that it helps you sleep but I still don’t think it should cost that much I can understand $1.10 or $2.00 but 3 not so much,My opinion about the app
5,2022-04-15 03:43:47,"The three features that I love about this app: 1: I can create, adjust individual sound levels and save my own mix. 2: I can set an app off timer. 3: It’s very easy to use and well thought out. I’m super impressed. Thank you!",Great app! I fall asleep so much faster.
5,2022-04-13 03:39:24,"Whenever I get a new phone this is the first app I download. I have always had trouble sleeping ever since I was little, and with all the stress and anxiety I go through in just one day, this is like a reset button that makes everything better.",Sweet peace!
5,2022-01-24 03:17:27,"This app is REALLY useful in my life! It helps me with my life, stress, mindset, therapy, sleep, focus, work, mediation, thoughts, mental health and so much more! As an influencer, gamer, blogger, and a person to the world, I deal with a lot of things in life. For me mental health is a big thing I focus on in my life! So, I DEFINITELY recommend this app!! 😌💖",Helpful and relaxing!!
5,2021-12-19 21:37:21,I’ve been using this software/application for 8 years already!!! I’m a big especially when I was suffering teen anxieties and insomnia back then! Also planning to buy the permanent version waiting for the offer etc.,The best and the most Awesome application
5,2021-09-30 06:32:43,I love this app! I particularly love the variety of sounds (as not all rain noise is created equal) and the addition of wonderful ASMR. I have a couple of favorite sound mixes depending on my needs. The meditations are wonderful and I just love everything about it,Love it! Use it every night to sleep to
5,2021-05-26 07:22:14,We’ve been using this app to help my husband sleep.  It’s rare he is able to sleep through the night. It’s been only two night so far and he has slept both nights all the way through!   Let’s hope it continues,So far so good
5,2021-04-18 10:18:10,Right now I just I have the free app but I definitely I am going to try out the full up soon. Even with the free version those mini options and meditations to listen to and ways to store them so you don’t have to fish through every time.,I love it
1,2021-01-21 15:28:59,"I loved this app even though you had to pay to unlock things but then, if you accidentally even touch the free trial button it IMMEDIATELY signs you up without asking for a conformation or your password or anything. Then you get charged when you didn’t know you even singed up. DO NOT let your kids have this cause you will end up paying money. I don’t even know how to cancel this subscription! TERRIBLE. I also wish someone would read this and tell me how to cancel!",PLEASE READ THIS
5,2021-01-04 06:04:46,"My aunt recommended me this app and i’ve been using it to sleep ever since. you can make ur OWN sleeping music, LIKE WHAT. the flute is my favorite option, with the rain and thunder. and you don’t even have to pay. however, premium is an option. They have music, meditation AND bedtime stories. THE best sleeping app.",i love this app so much
5,2020-06-27 21:37:50,Just got the 7 day free trial For the premium version. I was already a fan of the standard app but I must say the premium upgrade has some really cool features as well as access to some really cool extras. I definitely recommend it. Might as well go ahead and stick with the one year subscription.,What a great app!
1,2020-11-19 04:45:57,"I have used this app exclusively to fall asleep for well over a year. The recent update is trash and really disappointing. The navigation is awful. It looks as though there are no free individual sounds to choose anymore to make your own mix. My thunder sleep sound that I always listened to is nowhere to be found and any similar mixes are now for premium subscribers only, and the price is ridiculous. Such a shame you trashed the app and iced out long term users in an attempt to make more $$$.",Ruined by the latest update
5,2020-05-03 02:32:11,"I’ve been using a combination of sleep sounds with the meditations for deep sleep and oh my goodness, it has changed my life! My fiancé and I are sleeping like angels in less than 3 minutes and are staying asleep the entire night which is rare for us. I highly recommend this app!",Sleep has never been so sweet!
5,2020-03-05 03:07:44,Relax Melodies is great for background sounds during meditation. I like the amount of free options and the way I can combine them and put them on a timer so there is not a jarring alarm to tell me I need to finish up. This app was also really helpful at a time when I was having chronic and severe insomnia.,Flexible and useful
1,2020-04-05 01:55:42,"I used to LOVE this app. But recently I’ve noticed that certain sounds don’t play, as well as certain meditations. I finally uninstalled and then reinstalled and my meditations came back BUT I still don’t have certain sounds. And I’ve had to do that more than once. What is worse is that I paid the premium price and at that price there shouldn’t be any issues. If I could get my money back I would.  I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone ESPECIALLY at the price you pay for it. 👎🏻",To many issues for the price of the app
5,2019-11-20 03:44:34,"I have been getting amazing sleep with this app!!! I really enjoy it. I just really want there to be more free meditations and stories!!!

4,2019-07-09 06:42:47,"This is a great app to help those who can’t sleep very well at night the only reason why I gave it a four star review is because you have to pay to unlock a lot of the items but other than that it is completely worth it to get!!

5,2019-03-16 07:37:39,"I live and work in NYC so it’s always crazy, nothing I like better than falling asleep to custom sounds, and one of the only apps that won’t nag you to pay to use it.

5,2018-11-10 05:15:19,Love this app especially when I'm traveling and it is too quiet for me to sleep. I'm used to a fan or other white noise in the background.

4,2018-10-22 06:26:05,"It of course doesn’t cure my insomnia but it helps relax my mind where i can actually close my eyes and meditate. I have the free version so i don’t have all the sounds but the free version has a VERY decent amount of sounds for free! I’m impressed, you can set timers and alarms and mix and match the sounds too. Good app overall i might upgrade. I think it’s worth it.",Helps my insomnia

5,2018-08-24 05:09:03,Usually I sleep with a fan on but I’m on vacation this week so I needed some background noise while trying to fall asleep. It’s surprising how relaxing the sounds are.

5,2018-06-08 09:46:44,"Sounds are great, good variety and you can layer the sounds yourself or chose from other’s favorites.  They’re not the type of sounds where you tend to start listening for the repetition instead of the actual sound either.  Glad to have downloaded this one.",Great
5,2018-06-07 06:00:48,I have a hard time falling asleep but in this app they have meditation that helps you focus on your breathing and you can customize your melody and fall asleep peacefully.

4,2017-07-26 15:31:46,This app has come a long way from early days of just nature/music sounds.

5,2022-01-02 05:41:48,"Love the ability to mix and blend sounds together each with varying volume levels, would be excellent to also be able to slow down or speed up these sounds as well.",Great
4,2022-02-27 08:39:20,"This is the only app I have found that allows me to play various sleep sounds together. And the smart mix is my favorite…truly sounds like I’m outdoors listening to wind, rain, thunder and wind chimes,no annoying loop plays.

4,2022-02-02 04:54:30,"The BetterSleep app saves me on trips when I’ve forgotten my sound machine.  If I could figure out a mix of sounds that would mimic my sound machine, I would rate higher. It’s a great app to use in a pinch. I’ve only used for sleep so far but should remember to use it for relaxation as well.",Not quite as good as my sound machine
5,2021-12-10 02:19:36,"This app always helps me fall asleep, with its many choices of mixes. Personally, I like the white noise, and the piano mix because it just gives me haunted house vibes.

4,2021-12-15 14:31:16,I’ve been using this app for YEARS. And I love it. The only thing is with the new sleep tracker update. The questionnaire doesn’t cater to nightshift workers. I’d love to use it to track my sleep and find out the chronotype I am. But it doesn’t have the options. :( other than that. Love the app :),Use it every day. Would rate 4.5 if I could
5,2021-11-20 03:30:46,I’ve always had problems falling asleep. I would be up until 4am watching tv because I couldn’t sleep. I decided to try this app and I have been falling asleep earlier and I feel rested when I wake up.,I fall asleep faster and wake up very rested

5,2021-07-15 04:32:22,I’ve had this app ever since it came out on the iPod touch. For years it has helped me de-stress and fall asleep with ease. The team keeps on making the app better and better! Glad to have stuck with it and been around for the ride for so long,Best App Ever!!

5,2020-10-14 02:21:19,"I’ve been using this app off and on for about 10 years. I’m never consistent with routines, but a constant insomniac, and out of all the nature sounds/devices, this is my favorite because it has some meditation with it. Keep the quality coming.",Quality for years
5,2020-03-31 08:54:52,Wish you could get premium on a monthly basis rather than paying for a whole year. Otherwise the basic version has some very good options to choose from.,Good but premium is very expensive
5,2019-11-19 01:26:57,I’ve been having the worst time with relaxing and trying to sleep at night but this app has truly helped. I can put it on and be out like a light within a few minutes of having it on. I even use it just to relax my mind during the day!,I love it
5,2019-10-05 14:41:18,A friend recommended this app when I was having issues blocking the noise in the office. I really enjoy being able to put a little white noise through my headphones. This app allows me that and to mix in other types of sound.,One of my go to apps to get my mind right.

3,2019-03-29 17:18:00,I love this app and recommend it to my patients all the time BUT if I do not close the app then in the middle of the night it starts making a horrendous beeping sound that becomes progressively louder. Ironically then disrupting my sleep! There is clearly a bug in this app that needs to be fixed! Otherwise I love this app and so do my patients! Don’t forget to close the app when you go to sleep!,Beeps in the middle of the night
5,2019-03-27 02:08:10,I love this app so much! But the only thing I would change is making more things available to the people who don’t pay for the in app purchases.

5,2018-12-08 04:48:55,"Handy when sleeping at a hotel and you have loud neighbors next door, or spectacular while trying to drown out your teenager’s rock music.  In app purchases however I have always been satisfied with the sounds that come with download.",Use it more often than I expected!
3,2018-12-10 05:17:19,"I have Tinnitus and I will sometimes use this app to help me fall asleep or even get through work. Some of the sounds are not useful as you can perceive the loop. Also, I wish you could preview the sounds that require payment as I would gladly pay for good background noise. I gave three stars because there are many free sounds where I don’t notice the loop and I like the timer feature.",Useful
5,2018-12-04 07:20:12,I never believed this stuff actually helped but with this app you can combine sounds and adjust the volume for each sound to create your own unique melody. I literally fall asleep like a baby with this and wake up feeling like a $100 bill fresh off the press,Try it out

5,2018-10-13 03:52:48,This app helped me out a lot . The melodies are nice but I downloaded it for the meditations. Anyone that has a problem sleeping should try it. I wanna pay for the whole version but every time I pay for a full version of something it turns out worst then the free one .,I recommend to everyone.
5,2018-09-14 08:10:34,Customizable app with a lot of options without additional purchases. Sound combinations with each part having adjustable volume helps you create just the right mix for sleeping - and you can save it for later or share it.,Really works

You still have lots of sound but, the process of deep sleep cost money and so do many other things also cost money!

I do understand that you need to make money but still.",So relaxing but...
4,2018-08-03 06:32:12,"Never written a review before, but was asked to do so in exchange for 2 new sounds and it was totally worth it.

5,2017-06-18 02:25:23,I really like this app especially in the middle of the night when I'm having an anxiety attack. I put on my favorite mixture of nature sounds and it helps me focus on something else and relax. I am reminded of camping trips in the woods and the night sounds out on country in the home I grew up in.,Sleeping better now

However, you lack almost every single feature to where you would have to buy the subscription to get any use out of the app. I would, at the very least, like to see my stats.",Good app but lacks features for non-subscription people.
3,2023-08-24 11:39:55,"I decided to try this app because it had a 7 day free trial to see if it would help. The sounds are ok but just not right I can’t put my finger on it but they just aren’t realistic enough for me.  My biggest problem is I cancelled this before the 7 days, the next day in fact and they still charged me for a whole year. So there really is no free trial.",Sounds ok
5,2023-08-19 01:19:33,I’ve been using this app for over a year. I love it. I have the free version and love the sounds available and that you can blend them together to meet sleep needs. I also like that you can save the created sounds and set a timer.,Love it
5,2023-08-09 17:18:00,I’ve had issues going to sleep since I left Iraq.  After I started using this product my sleeping issue is reduced significantly.  Being about to mediate has helped me a ton also.  Highly recommend.,Can’t sleep without it

5,2023-07-21 10:01:14,"Since getting Better Sleep, I rarely listen to the podcasts I used to use for sleep. The stories work well and I love that the low level music/sounds continue indefinitely (if you want). Just beautifully effective at lulling me to sleep.",Love it
4,2023-07-21 10:59:46,The developers have been adding new content and changed somethings around and I like it! Yea now I have to pay for some sounds I used to get free but there is so much available that I can bake do without them. I have a subscription so that’s nice but I wonder what now means for me with the new changes.,They listened!
2,2023-07-13 06:04:19,I’ve been using this app for well over a decade every night. Just in the last few weeks there has been a problem with it killing the battery on my phone.

Can you please remove what ever the feature you added that is causing this issue?,Killing battery

That is where I found your app in the first place. It continues to ask for me to upgrade even though I’ve paid for a year and cannot get a refund. Also navigation is very difficult and inconsistent.

There isn’t an option to get that money back and change the subscription either. This app is cool but not worth $60 in my opinion.",Charged yearly subscription wanted monthly
5,2023-01-09 07:31:26,Love the options and sound control. Really helps outplay my guy’s log sawing competition he has with himself every night.

1,2022-11-22 12:45:04,"Every night for two weeks straight this app restarts and nothing is recorded. I wake up every day to see that nothing was recorded, the app was the biggest waste of money. I don’t understand how it has such a high rating. But if you look at the reviews, they’re all bogus.   It just doesn’t work, there’s always an update with no description of what they’re improving.

I’ve listened to ASMR and relaxation music/sounds before but something about this made me anxious and toss and turn and actually start having chest tightness; I gave it a shot for about 45 minutes.

4,2018-08-07 07:43:02,"It’s very relaxing, and you don’t have to purchase anything in-app to save your favorite combinations.

5,2018-07-30 01:43:53,"I KNOW that this app is AMAZING and helps me fall asleep, but when I am also stressed in the middle of the day and maybe even when I wake-up I just sometimes feel stressed and then I play the Relaxing Melodies app and then *POOF* all the stress was gone and I just felt RELAXED!!!!

5,2018-07-15 07:52:41,I have anxiety and it’s hard for me to fall asleep at night (especially in the quiet). This app has helped me fall asleep and RELAX all at once. It gives you many options to chose from and be able to save your sounds as well to suit your mood that night.,Helps me sleep!
5,2018-07-13 02:18:57,New feature that allows play over other apps is a new favorite of mine. Timer feature also a plus. Allows me to listen to my bible and relax before bed.  Also allows me to block out distractions when I need to read for work. Easy to use.,Love the new timer and app overlay

5,2018-07-05 07:14:37,I love the sound of rain and I can make my own rain pattern thing just for me and it is really relaxing. There are so many options to choose from. And you can adjust the volume of each individual sound you choose which is really great. :),This app is great
5,2018-07-01 02:21:15,"So my son has been used to white noise since he was a baby. Now that he's almost 5 he gets to choose which sounds he wants on this app. I love how interactive it is.

5,2018-06-07 03:16:54,"Excellent app to relax and/or fall asleep. I love that I can set a timer so the sound will eventually go away after I’ve fallen asleep.

3,2018-05-18 03:19:32,"Idk what happened but after I downloaded the newest version, no matter how many times I save “my mix” it never says fully saves once I close out of the app. Even the timers and alarms don’t save once the app is closed. It’s very annoying. Can you please fix this? Other than that I’ve been using this app for over a yr and it helps me fall asleep, it’s great! But please, please fix this bug 🤞🏼",I did love it
5,2018-05-17 10:08:06,I have switched and upgraded devices many times. I know I’ve had this app on them all for over 5 years. Helped me through some tough times and pregnancy sleep issues. Works great for nap time and bed time for my toddler. Love all the options and features.,Had it for yours
5,2018-05-17 02:16:31,"I've been searching for several years now for the perfect ambient noise app.. You wouldn't think it would be so hard to do, but I was beginning to think it was impossible until i got this app!!",The layering of sounds is what really makes a difference
5,2018-05-14 10:46:48,"I have tried so many sleep apps and none compare to Relax Melodies. After a while the other apps charge per month and even per yr, not this one.

5,2018-05-14 07:24:06,"You can create your own music, depending what you want. I put it for baby’s, keys even for me when I have to sleep. Really good app!

5,2018-05-13 20:32:34,If wherever I'm trying to sleep is too quiet I just put on whatever it is I want to hear and go right to sleep.

5,2018-05-11 04:23:02,"Love this app, I’ve been using it for years. I listen every night and love that you can make your own sounds, and control the volume of each aspect in addition to overall aspect. Timer function is amazing, and this is def. an app I can’t live (sleep!) without 👌🏼",Favorite sleep app!
5,2018-05-09 01:49:49,I absolutely love Relax Melodies!! It helps me fall asleep every night and I am sure a lot of other people feel the same way! It is also really cool that you are able to mix sounds to your liking because most apps like this one you can only pick one sound. I rely on Relax Melodies each and every day!!😌💜,I LOVE RELAX MELODIES!!💕
3,2018-05-10 20:20:55,"I love the app, it’s simple and efficient, but the purchase option is definitely a downside. No one wants to pay month on a sleep app. They may still pay but I guarantee they would rather pay 10 to buy the extra stuff. And it would more than profit the company. It goes up to 100 for lifetime, ridiculous. If it was reduced to even 30 I’d consider it","Great, but should not be subscription"
5,2018-02-22 04:18:05,"Have used for 3 days now. I’m still learning app options and I haven’t noticed improvement with sleep but this app is enjoyable with its multiple soothing sounds. As a free option, there are no complaints from me. Thanks for making this available:)","Fun, facilitative and functional."
4,2018-03-06 03:13:07,"I've had the app 48 hours, it does offer a lot of sounds and real ones at that. Other apps have computer sounds. Peepers are my favorite and they're on this app. After a very stressful day yesterday, I turned on this app and was asleep within 20 mins and that is not normal for me. I'll give 5 stars when I've used it more than once lol",So far so good
5,2018-02-13 05:54:09,"I don’t usually review apps, but this is one of my favorite apps. There are so many options, countless combinations, and multiple volumes for personalized layering of sounds. The timer option allows me to fall asleep without having to worry about turning off the app myself.",Extremely adjustable
5,2018-02-10 15:43:40,"I love this app!! The sounds are so relaxing, and I love how you can create your own combinations.

5,2018-02-10 13:49:35,I absolutely love this app. I’ve used it every single night for weeks and couldn’t be happier. I love that you can choose multiple sounds and adjust the volume for each. You can create the perfect sounds you’re looking for. Absolutely recommend this!,Fabulous!

5,2018-01-15 05:15:16,"This app helps me get to sleep, and stay sleeping all night.  I’m now getting the best nights sleep I’ve had in a very long time!  I highly recommend this app.  The free version is great, but I ended up paying for the premium... I love it, and hubby loves it because I don’t keep him up all night anymore! 👍🛏 💤 💤 😴",Wonderful App
5,2018-01-02 06:38:35,"I think this an amazing app! Playing with the idea of $20 for it for the full tool and all the effort and time put in it, but I see where it is worth it! Mix and utilize your own mix of sounds is a perfect touch, then adding in meditation guidance and preset options?? Found my app!!","Amazing tool, but subscription??"
5,2017-10-24 05:23:24,As most would like to have a night sleep this is the app for this because it will follow your frequency as you’re falling asleep to help you fall sleep fast then it will allow you to maintain asleep you can choose the amount of sounds individually with a volume.,Relaxing to Melody

I love love love that I can use these relaxing melodies as an alarm!! It's awesome to wake up to these tunes instead of the buzzer. I have yet to use the melodies for concentration when I am working but I plan on it soon!,Thank you!
5,2017-07-28 06:56:26,"I downloaded quite a few of these sleep sound apps and this is the one I have kept coming back to. Some of the others sounds a bit too harsh, fake or digital sounding. This one sounds nice and natural. Very organic sounding and soothing.",I like the app better than most sleep sounds apps
5,2017-07-25 11:51:18,"It's an amazing app! Many sounds you can splice together to get the perfect relaxing melody for you, and set the timer to turn it off after any amount of time you want! Great app. Has lots of sounds restricted for the pro version but by no means are those necessary.",Perfect for relaxing before bed time
5,2017-07-23 20:14:54,"This is a great app! The sounds you choose to play, plays ALL night (unless you turn the sounds off).

Love it!",Helps on restless nights!
5,2017-06-21 15:24:20,"One of the best apps of it's kind. Tons of great sounds (free) for super customized combos with individual volume adjustments, and more to buy if you want! There's no annoying noticeable looping to the sounds. Great for a massage or to work to or just relaxing background music. Also has binaural beats for added health benefits. Two thumbs up!","Great combos, no obvious looping"
5,2017-06-16 14:15:28,"I personally love this app. I use it to relax before going to sleep, car rides, etc.  I love the different combinations of sounds/music. However, I do not use this to fall and stay asleep because the music distracts me from sleeping and will wake me up, but for relaxation and meditation purposes, this app is really useful.",Very Useful
5,2017-06-10 03:59:33,"I'm using the free version of this app would consider a purchase.  You get so many sounds and the ability to mix them is great.

3,2023-07-27 20:26:22,"I use this app everyday and mostly enjoy it. However, there is ALWAYS an annoying pop-up window that I have to exit before I can use the app. The pop-up is asking if I want to upgrade. NO! I don’t! If I did, I would have upgraded 2 years ago when I first started using this app. When are you going to leave me alone?!?!?",Pop-up annoyance
4,2023-07-25 07:45:49,This app has helped me tremendously- sleep quality has improved so much. My only complaint is that you cannot set the sound to go all night- the limit is 3 hours . Wish there was an option to play the sounds at night longer than 3 hours!,Great app

Now several months later, the green noise is locked and it’s another $39 to subscribe for that. I’m not mad exactly, but I’m pretty disappointed. Just seems a bit scammy.",Charging Extra for the Things I thought I bought to begin with
5,2023-03-26 03:20:01,I am using the free version of this app which is still very useful. I might even upgrade if I continue to use this. I really like how you can make your own custom tracks and adjust each sound independently.,So far so good!
3,2023-04-06 11:26:48,Doesn’t accurately record sleep. Said I was awake all night for 7 hrs straight. Zero indication of any other level of sleep. Said I was sneezing and snoring when the recording does not reflect that. Too easy to “end sleep recording” and no way to go back. Have to start a whole new session. Mediations are mediocre. Only positive is the sound of the alarm.,Disappointing
5,2023-03-13 20:33:34,I really enjoy all the soothing sounds this app has to offer. I use it at bedtime and during meditation & prayer. I even use it to help my 6 month old granddaughter fall asleep faster when I babysit. She loves the sound of rain!,So many relaxing sounds

1,2023-02-23 10:45:17,This app used to at least let you test out some good features like beginning sleep hypnosis and now all those are locked unless you do a free trial that signs you up if you forget to cancel.  The app just wastes space if you don’t buy into it. So disappointed that I can’t even recommend the app to a new user like before because I can’t explain the possible benefits without a good sample trial.  Sad and had to delete.,Every feature is locked 🔒🫤

I used to be able to create my own mixes but now I can barely find the mixes that I made a long time ago.  And now I have absolutely no idea how to create a new mix at all. Too frustrating so I’m going to delete this app. You are trying to make your app with so much information but in the process you made it harder to use. Deleting!,Bad
5,2021-10-07 02:24:17,It helps me sleep a lot better. It’s really the best app to download if you need help to sleep at nights you get to listen to something to calm yourself down and just listen to something that just talks to you when you need help sleeping,Relax melodies

5,2021-03-16 03:34:06,I absolutely love this app!! It used to take me hours to fall asleep but now I am sleeping within minutes of hearing such calming stories or doing comfortable meditations even being able to put together many soothing sounds together to make it to my preference!!!,Thank you so much!!
5,2021-02-23 07:15:00,"I'm impressed, after more than a year of horrible sleepless nights, I finally found peace and sleep with the Relax Melody App. Somehow my body, mind, and spirit just surrendered and stopped fighting thanks to an all night seranade of gentley crashing waves and the soft cries of distant night birds. Apparently I needed to return to nature and the app provided the RX I so desperately needed. T.J. M.",Relax Melody
5,2021-02-01 08:41:46,Love being able to make my own mixes depending on my mood and mindset. All unnecessary thoughts drift away and I sleep straight through the night. I’ve also been dreaming more which is interesting. I highly recommend trying it out.,A lot of fun and works extraordinarily well
5,2021-02-01 04:35:03,"This is one of the few apps that actually lets you try a good deal before purchasing anything at all, and it doesn’t even trick you into a subscription at first. Recommend!",They have so many free things that it’s definitely worth a try
5,2020-12-29 10:16:42,I just purchased this app and I am really impressed by the choices on the app as well as the options I have to make up my own sound combinations. New things are added almost daily so far to every section! I’m so glad I decided to try it. Thank you!,Superb Choices!
5,2020-08-18 06:44:59,I use this app to help me go to sleep. Before I couldn’t sleep unless my tv was on. With this I made my own sound that helps me fall asleep in less than 5 minutes of turning it on! Now I can sleep without the brightness of my tv waking me up when I roll over in my sleep,Love it
4,2020-09-18 05:19:19,"Did this for two free sounds tbh. Bought an annual subscription 4 years ago and can’t seem to get it permanently canceled(good luck if you try canceling that subscription), but I’m glad it never did. The sounds are cool and so are all of the meditations and stories. There is a lot to go through which is nice.  Wish it was a little cheaper annually.",Pretty decent
2,2020-09-17 05:08:11,"We pay for a premium membership and we all use this in our household. The brainwave nosies is one is the main reasons I keep this app and they no longer work. It keeps saying that some of the sounds are not download on your device and gives an option to download, says it’s successful and still doesn’t work. I’m highly disappointed as this is actually used as part of sound therapy for us.",Loved it but now flaws
5,2020-08-16 05:22:35,"Awesome app, you can compose your own song with the different resources they offer you. One can even time for how long you want the song playing. Have gotten awesome nights to sleep since i started using the app. Must have if you want a relaxing night.",Really gets me sleeping
4,2020-08-18 03:09:22,"I love this, just wish I had more options that weren't locked but it’s alright. But this helps because I have nice sounds to focus on. And I love being able to mix them and higher or lower each of their volumes. I also adore the nice dark background. Very good for nighttime and just gives off a pleasant, friendly feeling.",It’s pretty good!
5,2020-08-13 02:15:31,Really good app to get you out of our racing mind. Even the free portions work great (I used only the free version). The body scan helps me fall asleep so much easier. I’m someone who often finds it very difficult to fall asleep even if I’m totally exhausted because my mind races like a son of a gun.,Excellent app
5,2020-06-13 20:45:56,"I have used relaxed melodies for a longtime and had some issues with a new device and my subscription and the support team was very patient with helping me to restore my purchases.

5,2020-06-06 21:48:22,"As someone who lately has had some challenges sleeping, this app has really helped. The building your own sounds feature is awesome.

5,2020-04-14 02:16:09,"Great app to use for falling asleep (rain, thunder, ocean waves are my favorites), if you live in the city this is a good app to help block out other noises. I’ve tried other similar apps, but enjoy this one. I got the free version, so I don’t know how the other locked features are, but for what I can access, it’s good.",Great app
4,2020-04-19 08:13:12,"I love this app it helps me sleep and lower my anxiety, I have trouble sleeping due to anxiety and I don’t want to take medication for it any longer relax melodies has helped, I like the meditations too I listen to the present moment a lot.

4,2019-12-27 06:10:08,"Great app, I think it has awesome potential. But the cost for premium being so much YEARLY??  I don’t think so. I really want the full features but I am not paying that every year for a sleep app. There should be ways to unlock certain things for certain prices instead. I’d actually do that.  I’m fine being limited for now.",Premium????
1,2019-11-11 06:55:12,"They offered a “7 day free trial”. I was charged $63 the next day. I immediately unsubscribed and When I went to report an issue and ask for refund they decided that wasn’t a good enough reason for a refund and denied me instantly. I literally needed that app for ONE night, and it cost me $62 and It didn’t even help me sleep or relax. Please don’t fall for this, or send to your friends for a “free 30 day trial”. I used this app in the past, and it was good, it wasn’t $60 a year good, but it was good, now it just appears they are con artists.",Thieves
5,2019-10-01 04:32:52,"RelaxMelodies is the perfect app for relaxing, studying, zen, or falling asleep music and sounds.

5,2019-09-24 12:36:37,Have used this app for several years and really like all the features. Mostly use for white noise at night and it works very well for that. Appreciate being able to create a sound that is soothing and comforting.,Sound asleep
5,2019-09-14 00:36:14,I like it and I might get the premium. I liked how they let you have some of the sounds so that you can see how it works for you. I fall asleep right away so it is really good for me. If you are looking for a relaxing app and a app to give you a goods night sleep then this is the app.,Works Good
5,2019-06-17 18:55:41,"There are so many sounds that you don’t have to go for the Pro levels that cost $$, but if one goes on to the paid levels it opens up a complete experience of meditations and sounds, worth the extras, but still fun without spending any real cash.",All round sounds
5,2019-05-03 20:47:47,"I really like Relax Melodies (sorry if I spelled it wrong), because, unlike most apps, the tune I pick keeps going until I stop it. I’ve gotten a lot better sleep ever since I downloaded this app.   And the best part: NO ADDS! That just earned this app five stars.  Plus, I can turn on the “humming” tune and annoy my brother.",Good App

5,2018-11-20 06:24:03,"This is a great app!   Use it often, from meditating to just using it for background noise when trying to fall asleep.  Great variety of sounds and the ability to layer them and adjust the volume of individual sounds within the medley is really helpful.",Love this app
3,2019-03-15 02:27:51,"I use and enjoy this app- I would be entirely willing to pay $2 or $3 dollars a month for this, but to shell out almost $40 at one time?? I understand that it’s for a whole year’s access, but I just don’t understand why a more accessible payment option isn’t available. I feel like you guys would get so many more purchases if your pricing system wasn’t so steep.","Great app, dumb pricing."
5,2018-11-19 04:20:12,"This app was exactly what I needed!! The sounds were beautiful, and it stays playing even when the app is closed if you want it too. Some things were locked and you needed to lay but I understand you need to make SOME money on a free app!","Perfect, but some things are locked"
5,2018-11-16 00:39:37,I remember when this app came out after the second generation of iPhone. It was helpful then and is still going strong and has somehow improved over the years. This app is the one thing that can define perfection getting better.,Just perfect.
5,2018-11-06 03:30:23,This is the best relaxing sound app I have found! I needed something for when I was traveling to block out noises in the hotel.

5,2018-10-18 06:11:27,"Randomly discovered this app, and I am now obsessed! I like going to sleep with the tv or music on, but this is so much better. I tried the meditation option last night and found myself so relaxes within the first 5mins. Highly recommend this app.",What a find!
5,2018-10-16 03:11:01,"I use this particular app to eliminate extra weight in my suitcase when traveling, by not having to carry a separate sound machine. I love the variety of sounds, and having the ability to adjust the volume of each individual sound.",Very soothing
5,2018-10-01 17:10:52,I’ve tried a number of these types of apps but I find this one to be the best. The selections of sounds and music are wide enough that I think almost anyone would be able to put together something that they’d find would fit their needs.,Good vibes
3,2018-10-13 04:03:10,I love this app but have had some frustrations.  Started using the app on my fire tablet and upgraded to Lifetime Pro...for some reason it stopped giving me access to pro on the tablet so I asked for it to be moved to my iPhone it worked until I upgraded to a newer iPhone and now I can’t access the pro.  Very frustrating because I used the meditations every night.,Kinda good but frustrating

5,2018-01-29 03:16:29,"I found this app by accident. I’m so glad I did. I love how you are great a custom collection of sounds that you can control the volume on. Definitely helps me sleep better, perfect replacement for ‘white noise’ (which, ironically, is one sound you can get). Trust me, this is a very useful app and will help.",Love this app!
5,2018-01-20 01:52:15,"I simply love this app. It just makes my day a whole lot better, and for my studies is amazing. I definitely recommend that everyone should have this on their phone. I know it’s a cliche, but it really does help on every day stress, and it is great when listening to it in the car.",💆🏻‍♀️💆🏻‍♀️💆🏻‍♀️
4,2018-01-26 07:44:41,"I usually sleep with a fan at night, until my husband made a comment about how he was going to record a fan and I can just listen to it to help fall asleep but not run all night. I got to thinking, there must be an app for that! I program the white noise and wind sound to play for 20 min and it easily helps me fall asleep at night.",Silent Nights
5,2018-01-17 16:24:16,I love this app! I have used a few different ones and this is by far my favorite! It plays as long as you want it to and you can make your own mixes and there are A LOT of different sounds! Download it! I use this app every single night! My husband and I both love it!,Great!
5,2017-12-07 12:49:32,"It’s getting cold in New England and, as an alternative to my trusty (yet breezy) fan for white noise, I decided to try this app. Great sound quality, no obvious “loop” in the rain/ storm sounds that I’ve noticed thus far, and very relaxing meditations. Awesome as a free app, even better with the subscription!! Definitely recommended!!",Great relaxation & meditation app!
4,2018-01-17 03:30:03,"Love this app! I have been using it to fall asleep to and it’s great in the AM while I’m getting up. It’s super customizable.   I do think the tracks need to be longer. “Eternity”, for example, is a short track where you can tell when it is starting at the beginning again. It is distracting and feel ringtone-like.",Great app for sleep and waking up!
5,2017-11-12 04:47:43,My quality of sleep and time frame I fall asleep as improved. I don’t fight to fall asleep anymore. I like the timer feature where the sound will turn off after a certain amount of time so your phone isn’t running all night.,Helpful!
4,2017-11-25 05:18:09,"This app is at least as good as my other noise apps - the number of options is higher, though. I really appreciate the ability to change the volume of individual sounds. It does sometimes crash when other sounds on the phone (such as the alarm) start, however.",Great app
5,2017-11-04 19:14:29,"I really enjoy this app. It helps me relax & offers an extensive array of sounds. I particular like that there's a timer to exit the app while you mediate or relax, for those who need to keep track of time. The interface & design of this is excellent, the creators paid great attention to detail.",Great app with lovely details!
5,2017-10-13 15:27:46,"I've downloaded many sound apps and after narrowing it down this is the only one left and I love it. You put your own sounds together to create something of your own thats uniquely made for you to help you sleep, relax, meditate, ect.",The only sound app I recommend!
5,2017-10-08 07:01:01,"A friend introduced me to Relax Melodies. I didn't know what to think it but the more I use the app, the more I fall in love with it. There are so many peaceful sounds and helpful meditations you can hear and follow. I actually fell asleep listening to a mediation just a few days ago. It was so calming. Definitely recommend.",Awesome!
5,2017-09-20 06:52:02,"Was thinking about buying a sound machine until a friend told me about this. Nice sound quality & lots of options! Drowns out apartment sounds (loud tv next door, cats outside) without adding another item to the nightstand! Helps my dog too, he gets scared with fireworks & this helps a lot.",Pretty great sound app!
5,2017-09-11 09:27:17,I have serious issues falling asleep at times this app helps a lot. It even has a timer for it to go off after a certain amout of time.  The mediation is surprisingly helpful in getting you to focus calm down and start drifting to sleep. Great app would recommend,Very helpful
5,2017-08-18 05:03:28,Absolutely perfect for those nights where I find it difficult to fall asleep. Love that he app provides a clock and timer. Although I think it's fun to leave the sounds playing and let my dreams incorporate with them. 10/10 would recommend.,Take me away
5,2017-08-10 01:39:31,I've been using this app for years. I love the individual sounds along with the way one can do combinations. I can listen to the rain and the wind or change it up to the sound of the ocean. The guided meditations are a great option for novices. Definitely recommend this app to my friends.,Best meditation App
5,2017-07-11 03:07:40,Love this app. Lots of options and countless Sounds combinations. Even has a timer that allows you to set the number of hours for Sounds to play. Have recommended to many friends who rave about it. Highly recommend if you need an extra dose of relaxation to help you sleep soundly.,5 Stars
5,2017-07-07 17:52:28,This goes beyond just a great place to mashup sounds. The interface allows me to custom design 12 sounds to fit my whim of the moment. I can save favorite mashups to quickly choose one for either the mood I am in or the mood I want to get to.   The graphical representation of my sounds is brilliant and elegant.   I feel that visual appeal is sometimes lost on app designers. I say bravo to the creative geniuses who put the thought into an app which brings value at every level. Swinging icons of sound choices on strings is a refreshing approach.   I wish I had done it.,All apps should be this elegant.
5,2017-07-06 06:06:09,When ever my sleep schedule gets off or u start having nightmares I listen to my favorite combinations. This app also helps with sleeping at a friend's house or a hotel. Really recommend it. So far I've come across no bugs and don't think I will!!!! Love it!! ❤️💛💚💙💜,Helps me get to sleep and get rid of nightmares!! 🎼🎧
5,2017-06-30 02:35:07,"This app is wonderful for helping me relax at night and sleep better. I have tried many relax sound apps but this is the only one I keep coming back to. It is the only app I have found that lets me customize my own mix of sounds exactly as I want, and I absolutely love that!",Love this App
5,2017-06-29 11:55:46,I wasn't able to fall asleep for a while until I got this app. It has an amazing quality and has never froze up on me. The only catch is there are so many sounds that aren't available but if you are looking for the classic sounds this is a great app,Very nice but...
5,2017-06-19 03:07:20,"Great app! I like this much more than a regular sound machine because it has so many choices, obviously travels with me, and has a timer to go off after I've fallen asleep! Bonus is that it helps my husband sleep better and somehow magically reduced his snoring. I highly recommend this app.",Sleep saver
5,2017-06-16 20:41:42,"I'm using the free version just for now, but I really like this app. It's fun- you can get lost in it for hours (at least I do)- but being able to create melodies that fit your particular mood anytime you need to is great. Very relaxing sounds. I just downloaded it, but I'm definitely upgrading!",Good app
5,2017-06-10 18:35:30,So many free sounds and additional ones for an extra charge. We use this when we are out of town for our son so we don't have to bring his sound machine. It works perfectly! I love that you can combine multiple sounds at the same time too!,Great app!
5,2023-10-25 04:11:01,"I have been a terrible sleeper my entire life and my husbands snoring could wake the dead. This app - especially the guided meditations, isochronic tones and binaural beeps - are working miracles. Sleep is so important for our body and this is really starting to allow me to reset. I love it.",Life changing.
5,2023-10-08 16:34:32,The first night I tried this app and I fell asleep so fast and I had one of the best sleeping sessions in a long time it has been just three days or two and I am in love I definitely recommend this app especially if you have sleeping troubles,This app is AMAZING
4,2023-10-25 01:39:08,"Whenever I exit the app and then come back in to the chat box it always says my internet connection is bad, even when I have three bars. I have to log out completely and log back in, however by then all my previous chats have been deleted.",Chats
5,2023-10-06 21:37:15,No doubt this is the best app around. I’ve tried many and this app has more of  a selection and also offers mix your own From a variety of options. There’s no comparison this app is the best!’,The absolute best among all others.
5,2023-09-17 18:00:10,"Perfect for light sleepers that wake up at every little noise. I’ve been using and suggesting Better Sleep for probably a decade or more. I even use and recommend Better Sleep while teaching nursing groups about mindfulness, meditation and sleep hygiene.",Nightly use
5,2023-09-06 13:20:35,I've been using this app with my crazy combination of sounds for over a year now. I depend on it! Works much better with an iPhone than it did on my galaxy though. Bit this is the only sound app I'll use.,Love it
5,2023-08-28 02:26:42,"I used the free portion of the app and fell in love. I upgraded and use different sounds and meditations every night. I can’t sleep with out it. I bought for my daughter too, and she is hooked. Creates a great space to meditate, or help fall asleep.",Super helpful to prepare your for sleep or meditation
5,2023-07-24 14:52:29,"I’ve been using this app since 2016, when it was formally known as Relax Melodies. It helps me relax and go to sleep every night. This app provides the most realistic sounds and it’s a plus that you can mix them up into your perfect combo.",❤️❤️❤️
4,2023-08-04 12:02:58,"I love the sleep meditations, hypnosis, and stories. Tons of options in terms of night sounds as well, and the timer works great. The morning meditations are cool too. I signed up for the lifetime membership and it was well worth it as I’ve been using it for years. Life changing in terms of helping with sleep and nighttime worries!",Great app!
3,2023-07-26 10:04:42,So the timers don’t work but now when I play meditations or sleep stories the play fine for a while but ten minutes in it just starts all over again. But the other one doesn’t stop so it just talks over itself. Back to calm until some bugs are worked out. It’s sure not relaxing anymore 😟,What is going on??
5,2023-07-21 20:02:47,Perfect for meditation and even better to fall asleep. I love this app and you will too. I use it every night! From background noises to sleep stories and everything in between.,The only app I use every night!
4,2023-07-15 03:32:02,"Works great! Just wish they didn’t think it was worth the price they charge. Maybe come down on the price. I paid for the lifetime membership about 8 years ago, and then they changed things and I never got it again. That's why they get the 4 stars not 5.",Love it!
5,2023-02-11 06:42:04,"I have had trouble sleeping and decided to try better sleep. On nights when I don’t use the app versus when I do, I can definitely feel a difference in the quality sleep I get. I am liking the app so far.",Sleeping peacefully
4,2023-06-10 02:33:47,"I love this app! The sounds are so relaxing! I just wish the Green noise was free… I was really excited and interested in trying it out, but you have to pay for premium to use it. You also have to pay for most other sleeping/relaxing/meditation noises, which is a big bummer. All in all, it’s a great app",Great app!!
2,2023-05-14 03:32:32,"Have used and loved this app for YEARS.  Just updated and it repeatedly crashed when I tried to open it.  Finally uninstalled it and reinstalled it, and when I opened it NONE of the sounds were available for free as they had been in the past.  The entire app is useless unless you pay.  This was not the case previously.  Not paying.  Uninstalling now.",Disappointing update
4,2023-03-30 02:45:05,"After only 1 night of use, I enjoyed listening to the sounds I made when I was sleeping. A bit disappointed that I didn’t hear much snoring or sleep talking. I guess that’s good but I was hoping for some comedy.  I also don’t know if it’s worth $40 a year for this. It should be much cheaper imo.",Pretty cool
4,2023-03-14 03:52:44,There are a lot of good and unique sounds that are very relaxing. I would give it 5 stars except the mixes don’t always save and it is confusing to find them on the Home Screen. Overall a good relaxing sleep app with a wide variety of relaxing sounds.,Wide variety of relaxing sounds
4,2023-02-16 11:50:33,"I love the sounds to drown out the household noises, and when I awaken in the middle of the night and I can’t turn off my racing thoughts, focusing on my breathing through guided meditation helps me get back to sleep. I like that I can do a mix of sounds, making it feel personalized.  I mix water and wind, finding itt very calming.",Calming
5,2023-02-03 08:01:11,Have used the app for a few nights and it’s awesome! I barely make it to the end of a guided imagery track and I’m out for the night. Highly recommend! Will continue to explore the app and its many useful features.,Great so far!
5,2023-01-27 17:32:57,"I’m enjoying the app so far. It has one of the best selections for sounds and beats. I haven’t even explored some of the other options yet, because there is so much to choose from but that’s just another sign this app is great.",Liking it
5,2023-01-20 05:09:33,"So grateful I came upon this sleep app. It is just right for my needs in providing an relaxing, peaceful sound with the water waves setting. I was able to focus on the wave sounds and drift myself to sleep and setting the timer was perfect— thank you!!",Peaceful

5,2022-11-29 05:18:33,Just started using it with my sleep mask/ speakers to help me sleep without bothering anyone. Fixing to try the brainwaves and see what the fuss is about. All the sounds are crystal clear and I love how you can mix them to pick your playlist for your mood.,Awesome app!

5,2022-07-14 04:54:13,Helps me fall asleep super quickly !! I used to watch TV to fall asleep but I made the perfect mix of sounds and it’s even better than TV + I’m obsessed with the sleep tracking feature😴                         ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,Use this app every night !!
5,2021-12-22 19:22:58,"When I switched to IPhone I was worried I would not find this app again. I looked, but they’d changed names. Thankfully the aesthetic of the app is the same and I was able to find it!  My favorite app for sleeping, studying and all around drowning out unwanted  noise!",THE best!!!
4,2022-03-28 12:12:22,"I love the ability to make my own “mixes” of sleep sounds. I would love more, and the subscription cost isn’t super high, but I wish there were more free samples of some of the other features, so I could decide if I’m willing to pay the full price. Otherwise I really like this app.","So far, so good"
4,2022-02-15 04:45:21,"After trying a few different white noise apps, I fallen for Better Sleep. I love being able to layer different sounds, and all of them are super clear and realistic. I have one set up that simulates sleeping by a campfire in the woods on a crisp fall night. Puts me to sleep in minutes!",Best white noise app I’ve used
5,2021-11-24 16:07:37,Really helps me relieve my thoughts and fall into a deep sleep. I use to struggle with my mind racing at night and with Relax Melodies I created my own mix and set a 20 min timer. I always fall asleep before the timer is up.,Download if you have trouble going to sleep!
4,2021-12-09 17:15:59,I’ve been using this app for years. I’m not even sure when I found it and began using it almost every night. My only complaint I have about the app is losing your mixes when it’s updated. Very small complaint but today it moved me enough to write a review.,Love this app
5,2021-11-16 03:50:39,"I love this app. I actually don’t have the full version… but I’m very particular about the “sounds” that relax me or help me fall asleep and I love that you can customize a mix.

5,2021-06-24 12:38:01,I used the app for the first time last night and I fell to sleep listening to a story about a dream weaver. The soothing background music continued after the story ended and helped me fall back asleep when I woke during the night.,I loved the story!

5,2021-05-23 02:03:25,"This is a really good app. I never rate things, so you can take my word.  Nice simple app, no intrusive ads.  Some stuff is locked unless you have a premium subscription, but you can still do a lot with what is unlocked.  Easy to use, and good quality.  I made a water playlist and listen to it as I fall asleep. You can set a timer so that it’s not going all night, and it’s very easy to do. Sometimes having it “stop sound” doesn’t always work, but that could just be my phone.  Overall wonderful app.",Good app.
5,2021-05-17 06:15:55,"This is great, because I have insomnia which is hard when I’m a student and a teacher at the same time so I already don’t get a lot of sleep and this has helped me every night no matter where I am or how awake I am. Thank you.",5 star

I have retired from the noisy plant life. But still se your wonderful app every day. My grand children use it also. Both when with me and when they go home.

Peace, Love, & Light  Yvonne Browning.",After a 12 hour night shift it's so peaceful
5,2021-05-01 04:50:49,"There are several options to choose from. Sounds, music, meditation and stories. The premium version obviously gives you access to lots more but I love how many free options there are. It’s very customizable.",Great sleep app

5,2021-01-19 11:49:12,"I combine 7 sounds for the perfect background noise during sleeping. Their basic, free sleep time meditations have been good for me too.

5,2020-08-21 05:59:40,I’ve been using this app for almost two years now. I can’t sleep with out it. I love that you can have multiple sounds at once and adjust the volume of each sound. There is no better sound machine app!,Best sound machine app available for free!

1,2020-08-20 18:08:33,"Their unnecessary UI upgrades have really made it difficult to find the basics that I use this app for (alarm clock, my melodies).  In addition, the alarm no longer goes off.  I open the app and it says “dismiss” or “snooze”, but the audio never changes from what’s playing.  This has been an issue for about two weeks now, and if it isn’t fixed, I feel I will seek out another app that performs the same or a similar function.","Owned the app for years, since before it was a subscription service"

4,2020-03-07 13:08:58,"This is a great app I love being able to create sounds to help me sleep and listen to stories to fall asleep.

When I turned on the app, I’m Listening to the melodies and nature sounds and it’s so beautiful it made me tear up.

4,2018-02-20 17:03:06,This is the app I used most frequently because it would play even when the app was in the background. I loved this app and recommended it to many people. Now it won't play when the app is in the background. It kind of becomes useless at that point. What gives?,Why the change?

5,2017-12-12 05:38:41,"This app is amazing I use it every night! I do wish there was a way for people to listen to your sound without the app, if like it was a video recording were it stops after a while.

5,2022-04-05 03:31:45,I love that you can set a timer on the sounds and that you can have the sounds fade slowly out. I also like that you can add more than one sound and customize the volume of each,Favorite sound app
4,2022-05-02 02:26:41,"I really like this app. It gives you a lot of freedom to personalize your sleep soundscape. I love that you can pair sounds with meditations for the an optimal experience.

5,2022-03-25 16:28:35,I had some issues retrieving my lifetime membership I had back when the app was “Relax Melodies” but it was resolved by customer support. The app is excellent. I’ve been using it for several years and highly recommend it.,Great app

4,2022-03-02 03:22:40,"I think that Bettersleep really helps me. I have a lot of trouble sleeping at night and this app makes it so much better. The only thing I don’t like about it, is that we have to pay to get certain sounds and meditations. I don’t think we should have to pay to get healthy and good sleep.",SO NICE👍
5,2022-01-27 03:15:32,"This is a great app to use for relaxation and getting ready for sleep, falling and staying asleep. The sounds available to mix as well as canned mixes are by far the  best and most extensive of any sleep app I’ve seen. Definitely worth a try.",Great sleep and meditation app
5,2022-01-10 04:17:33,"We were looking for a ""white noise"" type app for our infant daughter who loves music and finds comforting in having music/sounds playing while she sleeps. The combinations I can put together are so perfect for that and much more.","Calming, Relaxing, best sound app ever!"
5,2021-12-06 02:56:01,I love this app because it does help me go to sleep better than any other sound app. But i wish i can broadcast to my speaker or google home to stop it from killing my phone battery. Besides that it’s perfect,Love but needs work
4,2021-12-31 05:07:23,"I’ve purchased this app by the yearly subscription for 3 years now and it’s helped me in meditations, naps, random moments of whatever your mind, body or soul may need at times.

5,2021-10-14 03:36:51,I don’t get sleep well at night and I was stressed before I got this app. I downloaded it and tried it and I am happy to say this app really works. The music helps me sleep which I need and calms me down. Best free sleeping app their is!! Def recommend!!!,Definitely recommend

I have used previously a sound machine that had recorded/generic sounds; however, Relax Melodies allows me to mix sounds, kinda like overlaying tracks in a meditative sounds recording studio. My sleep had improved in depth and duration, and I am grateful for an overall enhanced well being!",Good for sleep/anxiety
4,2020-04-09 08:39:25,"Tried this out for a week and i've never slept better. I would add some things to make sleep more fun yet still relaxing though.

4,2019-10-04 15:26:30,Great concept. Hear the sounds you want and get rid of the rest. Want a flute playing in riverside cave with water dropping echoing from the cave? Cool. Want to lose the flute? Cool. Just wish there were more sounds and the flute music could be a little less repetitive if you listen a long time but i know thats challenging.,"Love this app, wish for more sounds"
5,2019-04-28 05:18:50,"I have trouble falling & staying asleep. Relax Melodies helps me wind down & relax so I fall asleep within the hour. That’s GOOD for ME! Normally I’m awake 2-3 hours before I fall asleep. I like that I can pick a sound and music together, or either/or. One of my favorites are River & Zen or Ocean & Zen. I love the water sounds! Very relaxing!",Helps get to sleep.
5,2018-12-06 23:47:03,"I use this App when studying. I’m the kind of person that needs that background noise and I’ve learned that TV is not the best option.

I am purely amazed!",Pure Amazement
5,2018-11-03 05:42:20,"I use this app for so many things.

I have trouble focusing anyway and this helps keep me free from distractions. I am so much more productive with this app.",Love it! So versatile!
5,2018-10-21 01:07:23,Our fourth baby was a very fussy newborn. She hated the car. She had a hard time falling asleep for naps and at bedtime.

Otherwise I would sit up an additional 2 to 3 hours reading a book or watching silly shows on TV",Helping me achieve a peaceful sleep
4,2018-10-12 09:36:38,"Although I had only tried one or two others, this app is awesome! The only reason I didn’t give a 5, is that it takes some playing to get everything the way you want. But SO many choices! I’m not using it to its potential (I’ve only saved 1 two-sound combo), but the ability to do that is so cool!",Great app!
5,2018-10-05 03:34:08,"I travel a lot for work and often had trouble sleeping at the hotel. However, I started using the meditations and can now consistently get to sleep by the end of the session. I also use it on planes for the same function.  It has been quite useful.",Great App

2,2018-09-08 15:04:42,I have enjoyed using this app for a long while and I am not denying the fact that this is a great app. Years ago I invested in the Premium offer of Relax Melodies which gave you unlimited access to all that was offered. Apparently that no longer applies now that they have shifted to the practice of PRO memberships. Unfortunately I will no longer be supporting this developer as I feel I can no longer trust that my investment will live up to their promise.,How can one Relax

I really love the rain sound and it helps me to fall in sleep quickly. ——————————————————— The comment above is what I wrote 1 yr ago after I spent $20 to by a “Lifetime Sleep Plan” on this app. Recently, when I reopen this app, the system is upgraded and they ask me to buy the pro plan again. Excuse me? That means I waste $20 for trusting your promise for “lifetime”. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING ON THIS APP BECAUSE THEY CAN FREQUENTLY “UPGRADE” THEIR SYSTEM AND ERASE YOUR PREVIOUS HISTORY PAYMENT RECORDS.",Shame on this App.
5,2018-08-20 03:48:15,Haven’t even tried any of the other features but I highly recommend the app for all the sound options and mixers that let you control each sound individually to get the perfect blend of relaxation. Zzzzzz,Very relaxing sounds to fall asleep to!

My problem is that I downloaded the app and only THEN found out it costs money.  That information should be on the advertising in the App Store. I feel like this is just a bit deceptive.

I love the slow waves with birds and sea waves.",Nice mix but costly for more

If I try to verify me email, the program just freezes on the email sent screen and doesn’t even send the email.

So sad what happened to a great app.",Used to be good.

I LOVE the app and recommend to all my family and friends.,Daily Use
4,2018-05-15 08:19:55,"Has better fan sound than other apps I have tried. I don't like that you have to turn each sound off manually after turning it on (causing combined sounds), makes it annoying when trying one sound after another quickly.",Works for me

There also appears to be some meditation segments but I haven’t tried that portion as yet.  It’s quite nice and the price is not as hefty as other meditation apps out there.  I appreciate the fact that you can listen to other “liked” melodies and not have to create your own all the time.  It does appear as though if you really want to experience the app in its true depth, you’ll need to make time to really make soothing beats since you can already stream soothing music from many other sources.",Soothing

2,2023-05-09 08:21:53,"Honestly the app seems like a great app, but literally everything is locked. Some warning would have been helpful that the app included payment to be used at all bc I can only listen to one thing and get there are millions of things on the app. It would at least be helpful to make more things free instead of 1 thing of of so many options sorry",Sorry but…
5,2023-03-25 22:18:36,"I started using this app and I was able to create a mix of sounds ( Green noise, anxiety healer) . I can definitely feel that I had a deep sleep and more relaxed. I felt a sense of relief and will explore more sounds. I highly recommend this app.. thank you",Healing powers
4,2023-04-02 10:28:34,It's okay it's really frustrating to have things locked behind a pay wall essentially especially if I really needed them I can't afford premium but don't know where to find my sleep recordings but it's a good app I guess at least it will record my sleep,It's alright
5,2023-03-21 05:35:30,This app is fantastic. Pretty much any noise you can think of to fall asleep too. It’s incredibly relaxing and even using the brainwaves you can really feel yourself drifting off and it’s amazing. You won’t be disappointed,I Love It
4,2023-03-24 04:11:56,"I like the app, there is a decent amount of free sounds to mix and match. I don’t like how pushy it is though, constantly popping up and trying to force you to subscribe. The pop ups make it seem like you have no choice but to pay, and come up constantly.",Good but too pushy
5,2023-03-09 03:51:38,I have really bad insomnia and would get now sleep at all. I thought this app was gonna be cheesy but it actually helps a lot. Would recommend.👍🏼👍🏼 pretty decent variety of sound minus the one you have to pay for.,Love this app
5,2023-02-18 23:33:49,We’ve been using another sleep app for the past year. When our subscription ended we wanted to try something new. I’m really liking Better Sleep so far! I love how customizable it is.,I really like it
3,2023-03-02 18:03:02,"All the sounds and meditations are great but the actual sleep tracker only allows the sounds to be played for 3 hours. It always wakes me up when the sounds stop so I never use the tracker but I would really like to. For this reason, I ended my subscription but still use it for sounds at night to drown out my loud roommates and neighbors.",Great but
5,2023-02-14 04:26:28,I downloaded this app while away from home on business travel when I wasn’t able to fall asleep. Game changer. I was asleep within 10 minutes. It’s been my go-to ever since!,Ultimate relaxation

5,2022-12-04 18:37:26,"I should not have to pay to unlock sounds, and bed time stories. Even though it’s not that much money we should not pay for the most simple of things. Other than that I love this app!",Love it but…
3,2022-12-24 01:24:27,There was some update after I subscribed for the recording and suddenly now if I want to record sounds while sleeping there is an automatic 3-hour shutoff of my sound machine. SO I WAKE UP BECAUSE THE SOUND STOPPED! Why?! Why would you do that. I kept hoping with each update it would revert back but it is still the same.,Used to be much better!
5,2022-11-29 07:14:24,Great app with nice variety of sounds to clear your mind and calm your brain… less thoughts per minute! Always puts me to sleep at those times when I’m thinking too much. Very helpful with it’s built in timer! Well done! 🥱😴🫶🏼,Bedtime soundscapes!

4,2022-11-13 17:05:20,After only three nights of using this app I am sleeping better than I have in months! My only complaint is that the free version is a bit clunky; I’m hoping that navigation is improved while trying out the premium version.,Impressed
5,2022-11-02 05:22:17,I have been struggling with sleep over the past year and tried many frequency sounds and this app does it - and fast for me. I like picking my own mix and I seem to zonk out quicker and sleep longer.,Working!
5,2022-08-21 10:44:24,I have downloaded a ton of sleep-tracking and meditation apps. This one has had the most benefits out of many years of trial and error. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.,I just started
2,2022-10-06 03:48:29,I wanted to like this app but there is a very annoying bug in the app. When you open it and it has the picks for you on the main page the card plays no matter if it’s muted. It will also play when you go into any other material the river of hypnosis selection will play in the background of whatever else you’re playing.,Pretty annoying bug
4,2022-10-05 05:16:27,I am falling asleep so much faster and my sleep is such a better quality. Didn’t think something so simple would make such a huge difference. Only wish it weren’t so darn expensive. That’s a barrier that is standing between the fourth and fifth star.,Peaceful rest for sure
2,2022-10-04 15:03:53,It saves the data for one week only so is very hard to check your progress over time. Unless you take a screen shot to compare but come on… I would like to have at least one month of data if I m paying for an app.  Also not very accurate. Some nights I had a very good sleep and marked a 60ish and viceversa for nights I didn’t have a good sleep marked a 90ish.,Not very accurate.
4,2022-08-22 07:13:59,"So far I’m enjoying the app, but not having a basic free option to explore before having to subscribe is kind of a bummer. Feels a little strong armed, but the experience is quality. I’ll likely try the paid version for a month or so and reevaluate 😊",Pretty great so far
5,2022-08-17 10:16:22,"I love this app and find that I am falling asleep faster at night. I love the white noise soundscapes and recently tried the bedtime stories, which are also great to fall asleep to. This app was for sure money well spent!",Getting a much better sleep!

4,2021-10-06 01:25:23,It’s a good app and provides good sounds and things. Though for the people and myself  who can’t or don’t want to buy the premium. Can not get all of the things that others get.  I would hope to get more things unlocked.   Sincerely rat.,"Good, but needs more thing unlocked"
5,2021-09-04 03:32:37,I am a really light sleeper and also have trouble falling asleep at times. Playing this next to my bed helps block out any random noises from my kids. It makes a huge difference at night.,Really helps me sleep
5,2021-09-02 04:56:41,"My girlfriend uses this app every night before we go to bed and we fall asleep to it. I used to make fun of her, but now I can’t sleep without the app either! So many good sounds to choose from to help relax and go to sleep",Great sleep!
5,2021-08-06 01:58:59,Used for a week and the thunder and rain knocks me out and keeps me asleep. Plus there are so many sounds it’s crazy one would sleep with a train horn blowing sounds but whatever.  I’m sure this app has your sound,Works for me
3,2021-08-22 03:18:57,"At first I thought the outside sounds were great, but after letting the free trial kick into paying for a full year I can hardly tolerate it. It sounds like an AI interpretation of what might help a person relax or sleep. It just creeps me out now however I have kept trying the past few nights Incase I change my mind. I haven’t.",Just can’t hang with it
5,2021-05-06 10:59:37,Not worth the price because after you subscribe they lock almost all the content.,"I liked it at first, but then they locked almost all the content so I couldn’t access it."
4,2021-05-21 05:17:34,"This app has a lot of great features, from sleep sounds to guided meditation. They have made it challenging to edit / add sounds to previously created or found mixes, which is my only criticism, though this might be user error.",Great app though controls could be better

4,2021-01-12 00:38:33,I love this app to the ends of the Earth but it won’t stop crashing when I lock my phone. It takes me several tries to get it to play through an entire meditation.   I hope that gets fixed soon so I can go back and listen to these amazing meditations and sound mixes!,Current problems
5,2020-05-10 08:03:36,"Sleep with it every night. Over a year now and it never gets old. Soothing and calming sounds of rain, river, thunder, night, and distant train are my combo.

5,2020-04-20 02:38:26,"I’ve only tried the free version and it’s a solid app, with well thought out features. Don’t know if it would be worth $60 a year but hey, worth a try. Really does help you fall asleep, not so much to stay asleep, however.",Allows you to make a custom mix of sounds.
5,2019-12-14 23:37:19,I used this app for years and I always come back to it. Not much to say other than the sounds are very creative and aid for mindful and relaxing sleep - so glad some of these things are people to the public. Much appreciated ❤️,There’s White Noise Coming from the TV 👵🏾👨🏼‍🦳
4,2020-02-23 13:18:37,"I have several apps like this and this is my favorite The downside is that I only have the free version because it’s quite expensive in my book and there is only one sleep story. The one free story they have is very good, but I would like to be able to switch it up.  Even just 2 free stories would be nice.",Helps!
5,2019-06-26 02:45:46,"My first time writing a review in the App Store. First of all thank you so much for having it free, many free sounds and few meditation courses that come with it.

1,2019-07-19 23:18:48,"Just over a week ago, I downloaded this app hoping to find some peace of mind at bed time.  Nothing was wrong with the app.  I found a different app that offered free selections of white noise I like.    So, I cancelled my subscription then deleted the app.  That should have been enough to alert this company not to charge my card.  Today, over $60 had been withdrawn.  That is flaw enough to alert others of this potential problem.",Cancelled Before End of Trial; Was Still Charged for Subscription

5,2018-06-20 08:15:08,"I work nights and need something to drown outside noises while I sleep. This is perfect. When I don’t want to actually use my fan to drown out noises I can simply use this app! Worth a try, lots of options to listen to and even has a timer which comes in handy.",Great sleep aid
5,2018-06-19 05:41:39,The different sounds to pick from are amazing. Also being able to save your sounds and set bedtime reminders is really cool. Although I think an app like this should have more sounds to choose from without any fees.,My brain likes this
5,2018-06-19 02:39:54,Relax melodies has truly transformed how I sleep! Each night I set my music or favorite sounds and within minutes I'm relaxed and sleeping better than before! Can't wait for more updates that add to the already great collection of sounds! Keep up the great work🙌🏽🙌🏽,The Best
5,2018-06-13 07:51:24,"It actually really helps to clear your head and get to sleep. Also, there is a bunch of ways to customize your own themes that work with you, so it isn’t a limiting app. If you like white noise, rain, or something else, they’ll have it.",It really helps
5,2018-06-07 04:41:35,I have been using this app since I was really little (maybe 5 or 6). Just from telling you that Ive been using it that long already says that I love this app and that it’s easy to use and has so many different options. This really is a great app.,It’s a really great app
5,2018-06-05 03:31:46,"We listen to this every night, now, and it really does seem to help us both get to -  and, stay - asleep. It masks the sounds of the /early/ morning trash pick-up, too! The added alarm feature works conveniently with it; everything in one place.  Very cool tool!",Nice Nanny!
5,2018-06-01 04:25:18,"This app allows you to create your own tunes. Add different sounds and music and also lower the sound on one and increase on another. It’s great and so far no annoying ads and pop ups. It’s great for anytime to relax, meditation and helps me get to sleep. Nightie night",Variety is the best
4,2018-06-02 08:10:12,"I really like this app because of its diversity of effective sounds and music. The meditation audios are also useful. I am not sure if the Binaural sounds are really helpful or not, at least not yet. The drawback is that it is too expensive! Well it offers a lot of sounds and music but $20 ?! That's a lot!",Mostly helpful but has some drawbacks..
4,2018-06-01 05:34:51,"My husband and I use this app all the time when we are staying out of town... We typically use a white noise machine that sounds like a fan, so we love the fan sound. It's not quite as ""deep"" of a sound as we love, but it's super helpful for drowning out other noises and you can make it as loud or soft as you prefer. We love this app and use it often!",Awesome!
5,2018-05-25 14:46:54,I needed an app for ambient sounds. I work graveyard shifts and sleep very lightly accompanied with insomnia and anxiety. The variety of sounds to pick from have enabled me to find the right sounds that are just the right fit for me to block out most distractions enough to get some rest.,Works
5,2018-05-24 05:50:52,I love that you can adjust the volume for each sound. It’s helpful to have multiple sounds playing at once like campfire and river and you can adjust the volume to hear one sound stronger than the other. The timers are great too!,Very relaxing
5,2018-05-21 00:15:25,I have been using this for a while now  for relaxation and I love the options.  You are easily able to make your own mixes and I particularly like that I can mix music sounds and nature sound effects.  My 6 year old now loves it as well.,Excellent sound app
5,2018-05-19 10:54:51,Love how you can completely customize to suit your own needs/wants. You can combine different sounds and make each individual ones louder or softer. Also love the timer mode so I don’t wake up in the middle of the night with it still on.,Such a great app.
5,2018-05-18 01:59:15,I downloaded this app when I landed half way across the world from home (literally) and needed to switch my body and brain’s sense of night and day. The rain sounds were especially fantastic in helping me fall asleep and stay asleep!,Great sounds to help you fall asleep!
4,2018-05-19 03:28:01,I was so surprised when I downloaded this app- I was expecting the usual options like different frequencies of white noise and maybe some ocean waves.

Great app that makes for great sleep!,Soothing Sounds
5,2018-05-17 06:53:55,I use this almost every night. It surprised me how helpful it is to fall asleep.  I like that you can make your own mixes of sleep sounds and there is even a timer.  Some of them could be better but there are a lot to choose from.,Pretty Good Sleep Aid
5,2018-05-16 05:00:13,"We use it at night or for naps. Great for when u forget the sound machine for the new baby. U can open other apps with it on. I have had this app for over 8 years and I use it for studying, doing yoga, cleaning, etc. I haven’t needed to make any in app purchases either. Great app",Love it
5,2018-05-16 03:32:11,I’ve had this app for over 6 months and I love that it shuts off by itself. The difference sounds let you make a sound you like and the meditations are really relaxing... now if it could rub my back it would get 10 Stars,Best if bought
5,2018-05-16 02:37:25,My daughter is days old and wouldn’t sleep in her bassinet in the quiet room. She’s use to sound all the time with older siblings and this on my phone is perfect and relaxing. Highly recommend this you can have the app going and still use your phone.,Mom of a newborn
5,2018-05-13 07:17:22,This app really helps me sleep at night. I needed something to disrupt the worries of life that keep spinning around in my head thus causing me to lose sleep. I also stopped smoking marijuana; which helped me sleep. I like how you can choose your own combination of sounds. Highly recommended.,Great App
5,2018-05-12 13:43:04,This app is super easy to use. There are many sound tiles to choose from and I like being able to adjust each of them independently for loudness. I have several favorite combinations of tiles saved and I use them to feel calm.,Great for Getting to Sleep!
5,2018-05-12 02:37:53,I listen to this every night. You can pick from so many melodies and combine them which is awesome!! As well as the feature of the app turning the melodies off after a set amount of time of your choice. 10/10 would recommend!,Love it
5,2018-05-09 02:22:45,Great app. I highly recommend it. Since downloading I have slept better then ever. Love the fact that you can choose different mediations. Enjoyed the free version so much that I paid for the full version. You will not be disappointed.,You will not be disappointed!
5,2018-05-09 01:21:20,"I’ve always love this app. It helps my toddler son sleep at night, and helped calm him when he was an infant and nothing else worked. I would have given it only 4 stars, but since the update, I can now access ALL of the sounds. That helped it earn the final star. Thanks Relax Melodies!!",Love it!
5,2018-05-08 04:54:55,"My house is on a popular bar crawl in Center City Philadelphia.   Without some background noise, my kids and I couldn’t sleep on the weekends.

5,2018-04-15 04:08:42,My husband and I listen to this as we go to bed and we love it! It helps me calm down from a long night at work. I also turn it on when I’m trying to get my one year old son down for a nap or for the night. I highly recommend using this!,Sleep
4,2018-04-15 16:51:01,This app is great for distracting my rescue dog from storms and noises that scare her. The sounds of nature except for the wind & storm related make for great backgrounds while you can adjust the loudness to bring some to the front and fade others. The only thing making it better would be to add things with this in mind. (Also could be marketed for that purpose),Soothing a fearful pet
5,2018-04-06 04:23:12,Let’s just i got really sick.. i ended up in the hospital with the influenza virus and as i was laying in the room i put this app on to soothe me and it helped me out ALOT.

4,2018-04-07 13:08:20,"I’m a hardcore light sleeper and often insomniac. This has helped me stay deeply asleep. I actually bought the pro version because I did like it so. I wish it had more meditations and that they were longer. Instead, I use the sleep timer on an audible book along with this app to fall asleep.",Helping my sleep tremendously
5,2018-03-19 06:17:48,Everything about this app is perfect from the navigation to the use ability to the overall design. I mean the selection and availability and the diversity within is so intoxicatingly succulent. I truly do love it beyond all else.,Everything about this app is perfect
5,2018-03-17 19:02:15,"I love this app and recommend it to everyone - it’s so customizable and lets you create your perfect relaxation sounds each time, independently adjusting the volume of each sound and mixing up to 12 sounds. The selection of sounds is extensive and fun.",One of my favorites!
5,2018-03-16 04:01:48,"Great app, many different sounds, the only app that has helped me put my restless 3 year old to bed within minutes. Had some questions about PRO upgrade and they were prompt to reply to my email and answered my questions.",Love the customer service
5,2018-03-04 15:11:16,"Relax is one of my favorite apps! I use it during my morning devotions, or anytime I want to calm down.

5,2018-02-11 04:11:24,"I have difficulty sleeping without background noise.  This app fixes that with array of sounds ready to be listened to.  I sleep best in thunderstorms and horribly inclement weather, now I don’t have to wait for thunderstorms and ice rain to knock me out.  I just go to the app and I’m out like a light.",Highly recommend
5,2018-01-24 02:32:50,"I really love the variety of sounds this app offers. I have two other apps very similar, but this one has the most variety in sounds and it allows you to build on each other (customizable). Definitely worth it!!!",Very relaxing!
5,2018-01-23 07:04:31,"As someone who struggles with anxiety and sleeplessness as a result, the sounds have helped me so much in relaxing and taking my mind away from the thoughts that keep me anxious. Coupled with the meditation portion, this app has helped me fall asleep and actually stay asleep. I love it. I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to use it. Lol",Amazing
5,2018-01-20 09:55:35,The best authentic sounds to listen and relax to. This app is definitely worth it. I think it features the most unique sounds and noises for relaxation. I love this app and the sound selection it provides. There is so much to explore within this app and I recommend it to all.,This So Relaxing!
5,2018-01-09 04:21:57,"I wasn’t sleeping well ... at all actually. I also don’t normally sleep with music, but someone told me to try this app and so I did on a whim. Wow. I don’t know how it’s helping so much, but it truly helps me sleep... and it doesn’t bother my husband who can’t sleep with music. So I’m so thankful for it.",Amazing and so needed
4,2018-01-11 06:08:52,"The pay wall is quite steep. Yes, it is good content and the ability to mix and match sounds is really helpful, but how much you have to pay is a little ridiculous. Doing a price per sound or maybe a bundle pack of sounds would make more sense to me. A subscription shouldn’t be necessary.",Perfect besides one big flaw
5,2018-01-08 03:30:57,"I just started using this app, and I am finally able to get to sleep within 10-15 minutes instead of the couple hours I would lay around trying to fall asleep. Very clean and user friendly interface.",Excellent for Insomnia

5,2017-12-29 23:03:13,"I very much appreciate this app. The sounds are very relaxing for me, particularly the sounds of nature. It’s nice that you can combine sounds, determining which you’d like loudest. The variety of sounds in the free version is tremendous. If you need white noise, a muffler for outside sounds, or just something to overcome silence, this is it.",Relaxing
5,2017-12-16 05:26:21,"I have tried so many sleep/meditation apps it’s not funny but I have finally found everything I have been missing right here. I can design my own music ,my own back ground noise ,my own timer ,my own alarms! You must try this app, I am very thankful I found it!",Best sleep app ever!
5,2017-11-24 22:11:05,Amazing “white noise” app. Lots of free noise options to choose from and a few that have to be paid for. Easy to use. One of the best for sound quality I only use relax melodies and rain rain for my toddler. Helps to block out the neighbors dog next door waking everyone up.,Amazing
5,2017-10-22 00:46:12,"I use this app when I've had a stressful day and need to unwind. I work graveyard shift, so my body naturally wants to stay awake with the sun, so I love it most for my “nap” time. And the way you can set it to wake you slowly and softly, it’s perfect! No anxiety, jumping out of bed anymore. Oh!! And it’s awesome for meditation! I love it!!!",Excellent for relaxation

5,2017-10-04 05:46:06,I’ve had this app for years and they have managed to keep it relevant and updated and NOT BUGGY. I love all the options available; there are so many to choose from! It’s got an easy-to-use and appealing interface! I use it to fall asleep and the sounds relax me so much 😍,I Love it
5,2017-10-03 22:30:58,"This is an amazing app! So often apps that use sounds don't get them quite right, but this one is spot on. The sounds are incredibly relaxing and I have already noticed an improvement in my sleep patterns. The meditations are also very effective!",Relaxing and effective app
5,2017-09-21 04:10:16,Definitely like the variety of sounds - and the ability to control sound levels of each individual component. Would be useful to have some sounds clustered together for ease of use.,Easy to use - Lots of combinations!
5,2017-09-05 06:12:55,"This app is great for relaxing before or in bed. It has a huge selection even without the full version, although that adds even more sounds. I have found no problem with the app so far and use it every night.",Relaxing

5,2017-08-28 02:43:13,Love love love this! Use it every night to sleep. So many different sounds. I don't have all the sounds and I wonder if the pay is worth it. The way you have to pay is kind of confusing but other than that amazing app!,Great but could be better?
5,2017-08-25 02:45:35,"You go to exotic places to get away from the noise of the the city. Or so I thought, but my recent trip brought to a place where bullfrogs literally bark all night. This app saved my sanity and my vacation and I can peacefully drift to sleep with multiple options",Saved me on vacation
1,2017-08-27 19:31:20,"I paid for lifetime access and cannot download pro sounds that should come with the paid version. App gets stuck on ""Loading"" and then never downloads the sounds. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed ASAP.   Website ""Help"" link is also broken and does not direct to a real webpage for help or support.   In summary, I paid for access to pro sounds and cannot download them and when I try to get support there is no support provided. TERRIBLE experience.",Terrible! Sounds not downloading
5,2017-08-22 07:52:59,"Very nice wide selection of sounds and the volume for each can be controlled individually. So if you want a lot of camp fire, crank it up, with just a touch of pan flute in the background it's covered. Mix and match tons of themes and tones based on whatever you're feeling at the moment!   Very well done app!",Relax
5,2017-08-12 11:09:13,"Each of the selections is a good one, but I love that I can strip down to just melody or just white noise to meet my needs.

5,2017-07-27 08:20:06,"I love this app! I can customize my sounds and volume levels to my liking and if want to change it later, I can and it's easy! If you're looking for an app that offers sounds for relaxation/sleeping this is for you too!!",Just what the Doctor ordered
4,2017-08-03 04:29:13,This app has a great selection of sounds and it's fun to mix them up for different effects. I just wish you didn't have to pay a bunch of money to be able to use the isochronic tones and binaural beats in lower frequencies (for sleep and deep relaxation). Seems like they're capitalizing on those who need help.,Great except for price for more
5,2017-07-22 04:29:25,"This app gave me the power to choose my own sounds, which is an ability I rarely see in sound apps such as this. On top of that there is so much quality sounds to choose from. It is such a great app.",I feel in control of my relaxation
5,2017-07-17 17:22:15,I downloaded the free version of this app and was so impressed that I added a lifetime subscription right away. Countless sleep sound mixes with full control over each layer that is added. The guided meditation is a wonderful bonus that I plan to enjoy as well. Very pleased!,Relax Melodies has it all
5,2017-07-17 16:06:57,I first started using this app for my daughter when she was a baby and then grew to love it and started using it for myself as well. I love that it gives you the ability to layer multiple sounds on top of each other to create a unique sound.,Love it!

5,2017-06-24 03:40:59,This is definitely a good choice for calming noises and is easy to customize according to what is most calming for you. I don't really have any issues. There are many other sleep noise apps out there though so if u don't like this one just try another.,Good app. Worth the download.
5,2017-06-15 04:39:13,I have always had problems sleeping. However after downloading this app it has really helped me a lot. There are so many different sounds and melodies to choose from. You can listen to sounds alone or pair them up with others.,The Best!!!

3,2023-11-08 03:59:49,When I was younger my mother would play this for me to sleep and I wanted to revisit childhood so I got the app after learning it was still on the App Store but I was quickly disappointed when I had to pay to get most sounds wish they could make all sounds free and make a vip app for like $5.00 I don’t know just wishing I guess -RKJ,Good app one issue
5,2023-07-16 02:19:58,This app let me take a quiz on my chrono type and I tried the times and I got way better sleep so I was way happier .          The down side is all the storie u have to get a subscription to heard and read .        Another up side is that when to the sounds the most used sounds are free but the rest are locked but every day u unlock 2 new sounds .   To make a long story short it’s a great app and I think the free options are amazing and it truly helped me switch to a healthier sleep schedule.,😍😘😇the best sleeping app

5,2023-03-27 10:59:59,"I may have only used this once, but I put on a sound for 5 minutes to help get to sleep and i don’t remember it shutting off. That is helpful. Hopefully as I keep using the app, I can be getting better sleep.",Yes!
3,2023-04-03 02:22:17,I just started using this app and like the green and brown noise. They have a wide variety of sounds to choose from. Some of the sleep stories are a little creepy and not for me or my 7 year old and I don’t find the voices as calming as I’d hoped. The sounds are very plentiful and good though so it’s worth the free trial to see if it’s for you.  H,Worth the free trial to see if you like it.
5,2023-03-19 04:47:55,"Good for just background noise and there are a variety. The single clock face it comes with now is unreadable at night. Was a five star app. Now, I have to use a second app to display the time. Update: paired with Musicozys at night.",Needs more clock faces

5,2023-01-25 04:52:53,So far I’m enjoying what I’m getting onthe free version. Being able to mix sounds are incredibly cool. I mixed a dreamy piano with isochronic ? sound. My other apps do not have this option. Something unique!,Trying the free aspects of this app

1,2022-10-20 01:30:25,I had high hopes for this app. The design is nice throughout and the concepts are good in theory. But they skimped bigtime on the two most important aspects of an app like this: VO and content. If you don’t like either of the two voices this app won’t help you at all. After my free trial ended nothing was accessible. They are counting on people forgetting to end their membership and sinking an outrageous rate in an app that I would consider bottom rung compared to the competition.,"Minimum viable product, literally"

5,2018-06-06 02:31:47,I love the fact that this app not only lets you pick your own combination of noise it also has a timer that will shut the app off after a set time. I set it for 20 minutes and 9 time out of 10 I’ll fall asleep before it shuts off.,Good sleep

4,2018-01-15 15:40:04,I like many of the sound effects as well as the meditation sessions. This app was worth paying for. I use it often at home and at work.

5,2018-01-10 03:41:24,"I have always had trouble falling asleep, but since I got this app it has helped so much.

5,2017-12-30 11:28:36,I have insomnia and most apps that have white noise sound like an awful forced fan that is not relaxing at all. This one is perfect.

4,2021-03-10 03:12:32,Okay so On the melody Eternity I hear footsteps in the background and I wanna know if that’s just me or if they put it in the melody.

Thanks for reading if your still here.,Please Read this Review!!

The only problem is, is that a lot of the sounds are locked and you have to pay to get them.",Very Good
5,2020-01-07 14:24:26,The story’s end before the ending and I was curious what was the ending. The first night I used it I thought i fell asleep but the second night it did not keep on going. I hope this problem doesn’t happen to me again.,Good job but one little thing

2,2019-09-22 05:08:32,I will use this app with no issues then one night it will tell me the sound I want (that I used fine the night before) is no longer on my phone. Very frustrating because I have to be connected to the internet to download the sounds again and often I’m not. Very frustrating. Especially when I have the paid version. I’ve had this issue multiple times.,Buggy
5,2019-04-30 02:27:34,This app helps me with my anxiety! I can change the sounds to find a new happy place whenever I need it! I fall asleep to it every night with the timer! Highly recommended if you ever want to just take a step back and relax and unwind! ❤️,Improved life!

5,2019-03-22 06:42:55,"It is a very nice app that has some nice options to choose from.  I wish that the music option and some of the others could have played a little longer before recycling, and add length to  tones/sounds that can be mixed together.",Relax App
5,2019-02-28 12:23:54,"This is the best sleeping sounds app I’ve found. And I’ve downloaded so many.   With this app you can layer noises, adjust their volumes, save your preferences/mix, and create a bedtime routine.   The sounds range from storms, white noise, lullaby sounds, my favorite is the night noises (peepers, frogs, and crickets.) I used to live in the country as a child and did a lot of camping and these sounds are nostalgic and soothing.   It has helped me to fall asleep faster and drown out the noises that would normally wake me (I’m a light sleeper... and have rambunctious kitty cats.)  Highly recommend.",Love the custom ability
5,2019-01-25 04:32:14,Long story short my uncle died in front of me when I was young and I could never enjoy my sleep because it would wander. This app allowed me to design my own sound set that put me into deep peace and kept me there till I was in deep sleep. This app was a Godsend in my opinion.,Perfect for my ptsd and anxiety.

Thanks for helping me!",Great app!
5,2018-12-12 17:38:08,"This app is wonderful. As someone who studies and knows the power of the mind, and its connection to everything else, this app helps place me where I’d like to be in situations that I’d rather not be in.

5,2018-12-10 07:56:02,"I had this years ago and paid for it, but had to pay again a year later in a big update. It's a good app but pricy. Still helps me fall asleep and has an option for dreamless sleep which has been so important for me and helps stop nightmares!",Good App
5,2018-12-06 07:49:16,"I love it, it's just so relaxing.

In fact our whole family loves it!",The best!
4,2018-11-26 03:19:26,"The sounds are high enough quality (the cat purring sounds very robotic, though). There are many sounds based on water or rain that all sound alike. Same with wind and white-noise types like oscillating fan. Would just like some more options of relaxing sounds, i.e. meditative tones (not music)","Nice sounds, needs more selection"
5,2018-11-17 06:26:05,"I owe them a 5 star review, and I should probably buy the pro version too.  The free version is all I need, but I owe my ability to sleep easily to this app.  It's a lifesaver for those of us who can't stand silence in the dark.",Used every night for probably 4 years now
3,2018-11-18 06:38:55,I use this app usually every night and I’ve had it for a long time. Now you need to get a premium membership to get all of these fancy things that I would like to try but thirty dollars at one time is way too much. I would undoubtedly pay a $2.99 monthly membership.

4,2018-09-13 17:31:12,"I like that you can combine relaxation sounds and set the volume for each sound separately.   When I first used it it there was rain in the forecast.

4,2018-07-19 03:00:06,I love this app!! The only reason why I don’t give it 5 stars is because I only wish some of the sounds were not pro!

5,2018-05-18 07:02:11,I’ve been enjoying using this app to get to sleep by for about a month. I combine the “birds” sound and the “nighttime” sounds. It’s so soothing & peaceful. I’ve tried other sounds but they were to stimulating especially when they had a noticeable pattern that repeated. I love the app!,Great bedtime sounds
5,2018-05-14 04:23:27,I listen at work or when reading all the time. Tons of sounds to choose from. You can play multiple sounds at the same time and independently control the volume of each one. Highly recommended.,Great white noise app

5,2018-05-09 02:40:45,...that I'd get into using an app to aid sleep but it's been over a year now. My wife used one all the time before we married and introduced the idea. I'm a convert. Use it home and away. Love the ability to layer sounds for a custom mix.,Never would have thought...

5,2018-03-16 08:14:26,My husband snores. Finding something to block the noise has been a bit of a journey. I’m currently using this app with white noise or rain or combination plus some wireless in-ear buds and it seems to be doing the trick. Mostly. It’s not the app’s fault that it falls slightly short. It’s the loudness of my hubby’s snoring. {sigh},So far so good

5,2017-11-30 00:34:04,The app is easy to use and has a ton of sounds at your disposal. Other apps don’t have the variety this one does and is multipurpose with modes for meditation and sleep.

4,2017-07-14 05:35:40,I love this app! It's unlike any other sound machine app! So many different sounds to combine! I absolutely love it!! Only downside is that there is still some stuff you have to buy so that's the only reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars for me. But I am very pleased with the free version!! So it's really like a 4.8 or 4.9!  :)  it's DEFINITELY worth the download!,Very pleased
5,2017-06-30 11:09:42,I bought this app hoping to FINALLY be able to sleep while experiencing some annoying pregnancy insomnia. I'm happy to say that not only am I able to fall asleep HOURS earlier but I'm also finding that the quality of my sleep has greatly improved!,Great app!

5,2018-02-20 09:05:32,"Even if you don’t pay for anything, it still includes build your own sounds, lots of good pre-mades available as well. Shut-off timer, fade-in alarms, and go-to-bed reminders all also built in. Really robust app for sleep support.",Even the free version is great

5,2018-01-09 02:52:02,I cannot express enough how amazing this app is!  I have had more trouble putting my son with severe ADHD to bed and keep him in bed over the last 5 years and BOOM... here you are. He sleeps through the night and thank goodness so do I. This is soooo good for his little brain. Thank You!,Thank You Relaxing melodies
5,2017-12-27 02:34:28,Using the noises as background noise helps me get to sleep quickly and comfortably. Plus you have many options and combinations to choose from.   Also helps with meditation and giving a relaxing atmosphere for personal yoga sessions.   Absolutely love so far!!,Super Helpful!!
5,2017-12-10 06:03:45,"I love the choice of sounds, ability to layer sounds, control each effect’s volume separately, and add a sleep timer. One thing I would love to see is more unpaid content. There are lots of free choices already, but some more would be great",Tons of great sounds/choices

5,2017-11-24 08:25:46,I listen to this app to help relax my mind as I fall asleep. I used to spend anywhere from 30 minutes - 3 hours tossing and turning as I ran through my next-day's to-do list in my head. Not anymore! This app helps me fall asleep within minutes.,So Therapeutic!
5,2017-11-15 22:30:20,iOS 11.1.1  App crashed immediately upon pressing “play”. Has become completely useless. Was a reliable app for years. Get it together.  UPDATE: I uninstalled and reinstalled and the app is back to its former glory!,Loved this app; now it crashes immediately when I attempt to play

5,2017-11-02 11:52:59,Super relaxing sounds with a dude range of customization. They also have really cool timer features that exit the app after a certain amount of time if you were trying to fall asleep to these relaxing sounds. Don’t hesitate to download! Worth it!!,Awesome app!
5,2017-10-25 14:52:50,"I just love the music it works! I fall asleep every time. It was a great idea to let people choose there melodies, it might just make people more calm when they know what there listening to. But again the price is a bit too high, I rate this app helpful!!!",I love this!!!!

Highly recommend!!!!",Severe Insomnia
4,2017-09-28 04:53:23,"Still seems a bit steep in price to unlock the full version. There should be three in app purchases. One purchase unlocking all the sleep sounds, and the other unlocking all the meditation. The third should be a package price for both. $20 USD is a lot for a few different sounds of rain and the likes.",Great app
5,2017-09-20 10:48:18,"I love this app because I often have trouble sleeping. It's a problem sometimes and people get frustrated with me for it.

5,2017-07-11 06:12:14,"It's so great. I love how you can mix and match things, and the guided meditations.

4,2023-02-12 04:46:02,"Pros: • Very realizing sounds and music • It will record your sleep, which sounds kinda weird at 1st, but it’s handy. It’s really accurate too. • It’s easy to navigate the app • Basically ad-free!!  Cons: My biggest, and only, problem with this app is that you have to pay for ALMOST EVERYTHING!!  And it’s really not that expensive, kind of, but I feel like what they make accessible without the premium is close to nothing.   I’m going to try out the premium sometime soon and see if it’s worth it!!  Overall, great app! Relaxing and it helps me focus too",Great App!

2,2023-01-31 12:22:50,"Be careful. I downloaded this app to try it under the impression that I would get a one week free trial. I was dismayed to see that my account was immediately charged for a year long subscription.

I wish I could get my money back.",Tricky

Helps me fall asleep so fast
2,2023-01-17 05:06:09,I would like to add that on top of putting me on an auto plan of a year for $60. There is a choice of a plan for 6 months for $20. I know I may not be great at math but why would I choose 1 year for $60 when I could choose 6 months twice for $40?? I feel that while I did like this app I would not recommend it. I’m sure there are others as good if not better!,Math?
3,2023-01-09 04:56:34,I tried this sleep app because it offered a verity of white noise options that my Calm app didn’t.

5,2018-01-11 15:07:16,I have a hard time falling asleep and this app has helped immensely.  My husband likes it too so I no longer have to wear earbuds at night.  That has been good because I kept breaking them (turning in my sleep).  Now we both listen to nature sounds.,Great app
4,2018-01-16 03:28:34,Love the choices and options plus the ability to turn the volume up and down on different sounds to create the right mix to sleep or work by. Plus the sleep timer is a blessing! Only thing missing is an option to add and make your own sounds.,Nice app

4,2017-10-19 03:04:25,The sounds sound mostly good and seem pretty HD. Could be a little easier to control the mixing as the volume slider disappears after a couple seconds. Good range and selection of sounds - the pro upgrade (I have not done it) seems pretty expensive though. I think it really actually improves sleep.,Good
5,2017-10-05 06:59:01,I use different combinations of sounds each night as a sleep aid. This has a large selection of sounds and they sound almost too real. I recommend at least trying this.,Really useful.

4,2017-08-12 01:00:44,"Very nice app that works well but with a few small qwerks.   1: They need to fix the ""restore subscription"" option to make it easier to restore your subscription. 2: Increase track lengths on sounds in which the loops become obviously and uncomfortably repetitive such as ""Eternity"" and ""Flute"" to name a couple. Otherwise, great app!!!",Good App

The second thing is it locks up and you can’t turn the sounds off unless you close the app. Then you have to reopen it and hit the sound that is now accessible by touch, even though the sound is now off on restart, it is still highlighted like it is on.","After update, it’s crap."
5,2019-09-18 03:47:17,Minutes after writing a bad review that nothing was free anymore I closed the app and reopened it and had most of my sounds for free again!  Whether it was coincidence or not I’m glad I have my app back! 😊 hope it stays this way,Thanks for fixing

2,2019-07-13 06:52:34,I’m a 10 year old girl and it takes me awhile to fall asleep and then I saw Relax Melodies and I thought that it would help me fall asleep. So I tried it out and it did which made me happy. But then they started having more sounds on the app but you have to pay and become a pro to use any other sounds but otherwise it’s very helpful and if you have trouble falling asleep I advise you to get this app!👍,Happy with the app
2,2019-06-04 06:37:09,"So I just bought a new phone and redownloaded the app and I paid a one time fee that opened multiple sounds, one that help with my night terrors and I’m having issues sleeping again so I was trying to use the app and now I’m having a hard time relogging in so I made a new account and now I see its turn into a subscription thing.

4,2018-12-08 08:02:41,I use it mostly for sound canceling because I sleep through the day when everyone else is having a life. It works best on some type of Bluetooth speaker or headphones (if you can sleep with headphones in.) the free version offers enough of the basic sounds to get by. Not bad.,Nightshifter
5,2018-12-02 23:30:20,"I recommend this app to people often. It is wonderful for a baby who is sleeping, re-creating familiar sounds when you’re in a new place, or adding an element of relaxing sound to any space.",Would download again

5,2018-10-15 04:26:43,It is very nice and gives nonmembers a large selection of sounds. Works every time! But it would be nice to preview a member sound so I can get a feel for it. But it should only play for like... 20 seconds just to know what your paying for.,Nice

1,2021-09-02 15:08:24,Been using for years with zero issues until a couple months ago when they started pushing a 7 day trial to the paid app section. Anytime I open I have to quick hit X or other sounds go over my rain noise. I cannot even use the app because I’m bombarded by this constant pop up. Very sad that I have to delete after using for well over 4 years,Was good until they push 7 day trial
5,2021-07-30 03:21:47,I have several sound apps but this is my favorite. I like the layout; there is a good variety of sounds; you can add sounds each month and BEST OF ALL you can layer sounds to create your own mix!,Love it!

5,2019-11-05 04:56:03,I love relaxing Melodies because it helps me sleep and stay calm during school like when my crush talks to me and when I have to talk up in front of my class. It helps me relax and it has a ton of melodies for me to listen to! I think it’s earned it’s name!,Relaxing Melodies
5,2019-09-18 01:09:03,Still a VERY good app though. Just had trouble with my lifetime subscription but the ipnos team was super helpful! If you used to have lifetime and no longer do just go to settings in the app and tap: Restore Subscriptions!,Had its ups and downs with subscriptions!

1,2019-06-13 20:01:22,I downloaded and tried one time and was charged an annual fee for something I’ll never use again. And Apple won’t refund it. Read all details before you try any apps on here. I immediately caught the error once promoted that my account would be charged.  It would be amazing if Apple would send a reminder of a subscription trial ending so you aren't stuck paying $60 for something you’ll never use nor see the value in.,Be VERY careful what you download
5,2019-03-19 19:46:54,I like experimenting with all the sounds and melodies. There are so many versions of rain it must be a universal lullaby.   This app is also good for outside of the bedroom like when you’re mind won’t stop whirling and twirling and you need to focus.   This is meditation for me.,Perfect
2,2019-04-09 15:16:15,"I’ve loved this app for years and use the white noise to fall asleep and stay asleep.... but over the past month it keeps quitting after only a couple of hours... jolting me awake.

1,2018-11-30 04:55:14,"I do not appreciate that they locked two of the sounds I’ve already paid for to force a review. Otherwise I’d give the app 4 stars.  Here’s my old review: I have found this app to be very useful in helping me fall asleep faster. I bought the lifetime access in desperation at 3 am a while ago and both the meditations and the sounds are good for distracting my mind while trying to fall asleep. The timer is an especially nice feature - rather than clock watching I can set it to turn off after a set amount of time and if I'm not asleep by then I can get up for a bit before trying again.  The updated version introduces a filter for the sounds, which makes it easier to use and is a nice change.",Helpful app but odd organization

5,2018-11-17 03:16:24,"Using this for several years and kept putting off rating it.  AMAZING.  If I want to fall asleep, it never fails.  You will not be disappointed.  UPDATE if you have headphones you can give binaural beats, but they have a similar differential sound that is mono, cool",I love this app

4,2017-09-13 06:17:15,I would say it is a pretty good white noise app. It does give a bit of variety and you can also put a timer on it. For those of us who use to fall asleep that is very useful so it does not drain the phone battery. I look forward to more sounds in the future.,White noise
5,2017-09-11 11:50:09,This app is just wonderful. It has many different sounds that help me fall asleep or relax after a stressful day. I love the timer feature that closes the app after a period of time. Highly recommend for unwinding.,Absolutely love this app
5,2017-09-06 05:32:26,"While you can buy the full version of this app and get all of their sounds, there are plenty available for free. Nice to be able to mix and match your own sounds to make the perfect white noise generator.",Great white noise generator!

5,2017-06-14 01:17:09,Wonderfully made and so streamline. I love that going to another combination with the same sounds doesn't restart the sounds. Rather it continues as if you never changed and makes it so much more enjoyable and smooth,Absolutely love it
1,2017-07-06 02:07:22,"I wrote a review a while back praising this app so much. Well.... I take it back. I have used to oscillating fan sound for as long as I can remember to go to sleep. It's the only one I can sleep to. Well, I did the update and now it has to be downloaded and it won't load... I'm guessing I would have to pay for it. I've deleted the app and found another that has something similar. Not a way to keep people downloading your app. So sad and disappointed.",UPDATE as of 7/5/17
4,2017-06-18 16:22:53,"This app is good for studying, especially if you're a naturally anxious person and/or easily distracted. I also use it when I feel any sort if anxiety attack coming on.

1,2023-09-04 07:53:31,I don’t like how expensive it is you have to pay so much money for it. Trust me I can find little kid apps with a monthly prescription what is way more cheaper than this and there’s hardly any free things which is very unfair for those who don’t have the kind of money so maybe there could be more free things? And probably also a search bar. If you can’t find what you’re looking for!,It’s so expensive

4,2022-12-02 18:11:09,This app has helped me wind down and actually get rest at night. I currently only have the free version and am highly considering upgrading because of how much I love this app. Four star rating is only due to limited content for free accounts.,Great App
4,2022-11-23 06:54:28,I have use this app for one day. Try it out two of the meditations. Very soothing. One was a meditation and one was a sleep hypnotic program. Listen to the music and the sounds. Very adaptable to one’s needs as far as background music and sounds.,One day

3,2022-10-31 07:05:37,"I really like this app but I wish there was a few stories and meditations I could try out before I commit to paying for anything.

4,2022-10-19 04:52:38,"I wish there was more available without paying, it’s hard to know if you love an app when so much is restricted, but so far what there is free I have enjoyed. It is easy to use and there’s a variety of things",Good product

1,2022-10-16 05:28:35,"WOW. This app has become complete trash. So disappointing. I have been using this for about 7 years and have never had an issue until the switch from Relax to ‘BetterSleep.’ Now it requires an insanely overpriced subscription to access basic features, constant required updates, & the app crashes nearly every day and won’t open. In the process of searching for its replacement. Bye Relax :(",Don’t bother
5,2022-09-25 00:03:29,"This app has a huge variety of frequencies, sound effects, and music. I was instantly relaxed when I used the green noise. I slept through the night for the first time in a while.",So peaceful

1,2022-09-12 09:18:03,"I loved the app during the free trial. Once I paid for it, it stops working within 15-30 minutes. I have it set to loop background noise all night and it never plays more than 30 minutes after I set it up so I get almost to sleep and then it cuts off.  Not worth it especially when it makes you pay for the full year at a time.",Great until you pay for it

4,2022-04-14 00:56:42,Wonderful sounds but too many are locked before being able to try them out to know if you actually want to spend the money or not.,Wonderful sounds
5,2022-04-01 04:02:49,So my phone was at 70 percent and I left the sound that helps me sleep on all night and it only drained 23 % of my battery and I love the stories on this and I would totally recommend,Amazing
5,2022-03-12 01:32:06,The sounds are soothing and work well for my baby.  And it’s a plus that it plays in the background instead of having to be in the app.,Good stuff

3,2022-02-28 18:11:47,I do not like when I open the app it tells me I need to upgrade when I’ve paid for a full year. It’s not cool to open the app and you’re locked out of certain sounds that you shouldn’t be considering a year of service has already been paid.,Fix bugs
5,2022-02-11 06:17:44,I have a history of insomnia compounded by a husband who snores. I bought a comfortable Bluetooth speakers headband and subscribed to this app. The soothing music puts me to sleep and the fact that it’s blocking outside noise helps me to stay asleep.,It’s working!

3,2022-01-04 02:09:57,This app is great. Little confusing to use but not bad. The biggest issue I find is the trial is only 7 day long and you can’t listen to anything unless you sign up for the trial. The other problem with the app is that is it’s pricey and it is not Family Share enable.,Not Family Share enable

2,2018-10-14 23:45:57,"The free version had helped me sleep well for a very long time. However, not long after I opted to pay for it, the sound I’ve been using most often just says “downloading” forever, does nothing, and prevents me from selecting another sound. I’ve had the paid version less than a month. I tried contacting them via the app and didn’t hear anything back.",Love it BUT...
5,2018-10-09 04:25:56,This is hands down the best sleep noises app I have found. The ability to customize the multiple sounds and volume levels is the best. This app helps me and my child. I may try the paid service soon.,Best sleep noises app

5,2018-10-02 20:24:52,I liked this app because you could put sounds and music together to make a harmony but I didn’t like how most of the sounds you couldn’t use unless you payed for them so overall this app is pretty good,Pretty good

4,2018-09-11 04:37:52,I use this app to fall asleep often. Its great and has a large variety of sounds but recently (past 2 weeks) the urban rain sound will pause for a millisecond as if restarting. It totally throws me off when im trying to sleep. Please fix the bug,Pause in middle of sound
5,2018-08-31 02:14:49,"We’ve been using this app for years! We love it! Whenever we’re on vacation, we have a sound machine right at our fingertips for us and our two little kids! Better than a white noise machine!!",Love it!

5,2018-08-24 01:42:09,I have a hard time studying in silence but I also can’t focus if regular music with words is playing because then I’m unconsciously focusing on the lyrics while trying to read my textbooks...this app gives a perfect solution!,Great!

5,2018-08-18 03:03:32,"The noise is incredibly relaxing and I really like being able to combine sounds. I sleep better and fall asleep easier. I also thought noise machines and white noise was to help babies sleep, but I need sleep too.",I sleep better
5,2018-08-13 13:00:02,I used this at night for both my Daughter and I. She requests it. It has all types of sounds and the fact that you can create your own sounds and save them for later use is awesome feature.,Best Sleeper Machine

5,2018-07-30 06:32:35,I love the sounds on here and the interface is super cool.  Some of these sounds are amazing when you add a scent to the room like a lavender from an oil infuser.  We also have a baby coming so we'll see if these baby sounds help.,"So far, its been great!"

4,2018-07-28 05:11:53,"Nice sounds! I wish that the pricing for premium was a bit cheaper however, or there’s a way to watch an ad to get a premium sound free, even if just for a week.

5,2018-07-25 19:20:35,Love that it is customizable and that there are so many options. Isochronic tones are a life saver when you have a fussy sleepy baby that is having a difficult time getting to sleep. Works almost instantly.,Best sleepy time tunes for everyone
4,2018-07-27 05:02:36,The sounds are very well recorded and easy to fall asleep to (for Me at least). I espeshially like the timer ability that will turn off The sounds and the phone after 30 minutes. It’s also very easy to get into a routine with the sounds. A good app,Relaxing

3,2018-06-25 05:29:28,I like the fact you can mix and match the sounds and enjoy using the timer so it doesn’t play all night.

5,2018-05-29 05:38:15,Tried a few others but this one I love. It's perfect because each added sound can be adjusted for volume to create the perfect combination. Only improvement would be more meditations focused on different themes,Best one

5,2018-05-22 00:48:29,My house is noisy so when you need some time for personal meditation or study this app is amazing! I combine birds with the binaural beat ‘concentration’. I think the app even boosts my mood somewhat because it allows me to “check out” for just a moment. 😌,So helpful!
5,2018-05-21 05:57:49,I have used other apps but this is one is by far the best. It has so many guided meditations and sounds that I find myself using it through the day and not only at night for sleep. Highly recommend it!,Great app!

4,2018-04-30 06:13:05,There’s so many options which is awesome! But only giving it 4 starts because I wish some of the sounds had a longer variation. It’s like listening to the same thing that last for 5 seconds over and over.,Lots of options

4,2018-02-15 03:54:04,Firts of all there aren't such good sounds witch is really frustrating and half  (more than half) of the sounds you have to get a app for and then pay for it and then you never  end up opening up the app so it uses up a lot of battery otherwise the app is greet,Not a great app🙁
5,2017-12-12 20:31:36,Love the fact you can pick more than 2 items and there are so many options... not only nature. Rain + Eternity is my favorite mix right now. But my husband also made a mix and we could save that.,Very nice mix

4,2017-08-24 04:27:23,You have to try this app! I have insomnia which makes it hard to fall asleep and this has helped me so much. The only issue I've ran into is it keeps trying to make me redownload sounds and it takes a while because I have no space on my phone.,Amazing!

5,2017-07-25 02:05:53,"This app is SO AWESOME!!! You can create your own custom sounds to suite your preferences, or use ones that others have all ready made.

5,2017-07-11 17:04:26,Working in a open cube environment or trying to get work done on the plane with that crying baby behind you....  This is great.  The variety of sounds lets me block out the world and get stuff done!,"At work, at home, or traveling, this app is invaluable."
5,2017-07-03 14:57:09,Love this app. I use it both for relaxing noises at night and with headphones during the day at work to block out office noise. The sounds are soothing and it's nice to be able to layer a few together by adjusting the volume of each.,Great App for Relaxing
5,2017-06-28 05:33:07,"I'm only writing this review because they're giving me two free sounds... but I guess that must mean I actually do like it, if I'm going out of my way like this. 5 Stars for putting me to sleep pretty fast and no ads.",Would recommend
5,2017-06-26 22:43:09,Free version has a good variety of sounds. I like that you can mix multiple sounds. I mostly use this app while writing or reading in a noisy place. It drowns out the noise without being a distraction of its own.,For more than sleeping.
5,2017-06-19 21:23:25,"On a recent trip to Europe I found this app incredibly useful when trying to sleep through the night in unfamiliar places. It even helped out my husband's snores, so I might have to continue the use when I get home!",Best Sleep Ever

4,2023-10-05 03:40:57,"Love better sleep app! It’s truly amazing! Only thing I would change is that a few of the items that would be helpful are premium, I would give samples or something more to intrigue me to buy them. Overall good app!",BetterSleep
4,2023-09-17 02:27:58,"I really enjoy this ap but you can’t do much without premium, and to afford that you have to be a billionaire. I wish you could do a bit more without premium. And I do understand an app needing premium btw",Good but some stuff weighs it down
5,2023-04-04 04:15:44,"The first night I used this was amazing. I usually take over an hour to fall asleep, last night it was about 20 minutes!",Love the sounds!
2,2023-08-15 03:44:14,I fall asleep to various mixes every night. I went through a few different sound apps and this is my favorite. UNTIL  this last update. It crashes almost every night. The sudden stop wakes me abruptly. I’ve tried closing and reopening and I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling. Still happens. It’s very aggravating.,Great sound app but
3,2023-07-20 02:24:33,It looks like it has the potential to be a great app but those of us such as kids or financially struggling people need to be able to have more free content that allows us to wind down without having to worry about a subscription. Just a suggestion to a more free content.,My review
1,2023-04-11 06:16:09,Annual paying member for years even when it was under a different name. Stories now are flooded with Aster who voices Starship. Have some variety! Every story I click on now is her narrating. I do not think I will renew again. This app used to be awesome.  ******Updated review due to the response of ‘Nat’ ….. definitely will not renew now. That’s the only way I can listen to someone else is using the filter! Thanks for the dumb response.,Long time member
5,2023-02-28 03:29:20,Easy to navigate and there are plenty of sounds and stories to choose from! I love playing back the recordings from my sleep too lol I say the weirdest things in my sleep 😭,Love
4,2023-02-21 13:42:39,"Customization is the major draw here. You can choose from anything from colored noise to ASMR to soundscapes, or blend elements of each together!   Recommendation: Explore the app and its options BEFORE bedtime... or you're losing that night's sleep. Consider yourself warned.",Interesting and Layered
5,2023-01-25 08:51:15,"Can’t turn off the noise in your head and it’s making it difficult to enjoy a good nights sleep? Well, you’ve found your app! PLUS, you can customize the sounds 🤩",AMAZING app!!
4,2023-02-14 17:02:08,I like all the features but the app can be pretty unintuitive.  I wish there was more separation between stories and music and sounds.  I also wish the interface for adding sounds was more straightforward.,Okay app
5,2023-01-21 04:21:20,Loving this app. While I use a traditional white noise machine with a fan. Lately I’ve been playing a mix of sounds with a 30 min timer on this app too. I fall asleep quickly. Love it.,Love the free sleep sounds

4,2023-01-18 16:35:30,"I like that there are unlocked options, but a little sad I can’t get to the other options that are locked. The quality of this app is really good, very clear sounds and no lags. I’m happy I can use this app freely.",I really enjoy this app
5,2022-11-13 19:07:59,I suffer with Tinnitus. I recommend this software to those who have insomnia . Listening to the peaceful music that distracts me from the high pitch sound from the Tinnitus allows me to drift off to sleep. Keep up the good work.,Great Sleep
4,2022-11-26 21:38:31,"I really enjoy mixing my own soothing sounds to make just the right relaxing mood. I’m not currently paying, so I’m limited, but even so, I’ve found I’m using this app a lot. Still learning how to save and work things, but I’m liking it. Storms are the best!",So relaxing

3,2022-11-06 03:56:41,Just started using this app on an apple phone.  It’s nice but it seems like everything that was free on my Samsung costs money on my apple. I downloaded this app to listen to the different “color” noises but they all cost money.  The free options are really nice and look forward to exploring them all,So far so good
5,2022-10-23 01:09:50,"I love how customizable things are. The story can run a certain time, background music can be turned on or off etc. Perfect for my family",Customizable
5,2022-10-01 19:23:33,It helps me to know how much sleep I get every night despite going to bed thinking that I’ll get “this amount” of sleep and actually I’m getting less than that,Good
1,2022-10-17 09:23:58,"I love this app and have used it for years. It really helps with my anxiety and being able to fall and stay asleep. Even my kids enjoy it. However, ever since the new update from last week, the app automatically crashes and I cannot open it. It’s completely useless. I hope they find a solution soon… my sleep has not been the same without it. :(",App Crashes

2,2022-06-26 04:06:41,Supposedly the app says it’s recording but never mentions anything after that. I know my dog makes noises so it should at least pick that up. There is nothing in the help section about recording. Almost at the end of my free trial and I’m not seeing a reason to continue with the subscription. So frustrating.,Come figure out the record function
5,2022-03-24 03:50:24,"For years, it’s taken me HOURS to fall asleep. It hasn’t taken more than 5 minutes since I started using this app. Seriously, no joke. Over the moon about this one.",Unbelievable

4,2022-02-24 05:19:40,I’ve been having trouble sleeping for the last 2 years or so. This definitely helps calm my brain for sleep and I’ve been sleeping through the night! It’s only been 2 nights thus far but I have high hopes!,Working so far
5,2022-01-20 06:52:39,Very nice collection of soothing sounds to help you fall asleep or study. Enjoyed creating my own sound mixes for different purposes. Highly recommend.,Influence your state of mind with sound

5,2021-06-15 03:49:13,"The thing I like best about any of the sounds I play, I can’t pick up a pattern. It makes it a lot easier to go to sleep when you’re not waiting for the pattern to fall in place.",Awesome!

1,2019-10-05 22:36:38,When I opened up the app to cancel my free trial of the subscription it seemed as if the app had already canceled it. I assumed that maybe unlike other apps the free trial didn’t become an automatic full subscription. Boy was I wrong. Today I found a charge for the full year sub despite the app STILL showing no subscription. I forced a profile reset and there the sub was. I canceled it but Apple won’t let me get my money back.,Showed no subscription so was unable to cancel
1,2019-09-11 16:20:45,"So I had this app a few years ago and it has been amazingly helpful for my anxiety. But instead of adding dozens of new sounds to entice people to make a purchase, they have instead removed dozens of sounds. It used to come with over 100 free sounds. On top of that they want you to pay them $60 a year just for access to dozens of new sounds? This is a cheap and greedy tactic and this is a terrible company.",Developers took sounds away

I don’t know if he’ll give me the sounds or not but it doesn’t matter because I rather be honest.

However, there are many more apps out there that you don’t have to pay monthly.",Good for sleep

I use mostly the sounds I had gotten for free with the unpaid version.",For $20 I was expecting more
5,2018-05-17 00:28:45,I use this app every night when I travel for work & stay at hotels. I created the perfect combination of sounds from a myriad of choices that makes me feel like I’m back at home and lulls me to sleep in no time.,Just what I need!
5,2018-05-16 03:38:35,I love how this app allows me to experiment with sounds to find what’s best for me. The ability to turn some sounds down to background levels while focusing on other sounds is innovative. Great app!,Great variety and control
5,2018-05-14 22:53:54,"I sleep with this app just about every night and I absolutely love it!!! I use a combination of the rain options and it’s just great, puts me right to sleep. This app is very user friendly and has not given me any problems so far.",Love it!!!
5,2018-05-12 21:46:42,"I like the flexibility of layering the sounds.  Highly recommend for those who need to drown out general noise.  I get up at 3am, which means that I sleep when the world is still playing.  These sounds help drown the din.","Many sounds, so little time"
1,2018-05-14 13:36:40,"Unfortunately I been using this app for years, but the new update has wayyyy too many bugs. For example the pre loaded mixes you save, DON’T save at all. Or better yet you can’t create your own mixes because the app doesn’t allow you anymore. Or the time out alarms, oh yea can’t save those either ! You can get creative with the rest. Crazy thing was before you could do all and more!! Do better guys, Do better!",The New Update is Horrible
5,2018-05-12 03:38:28,"This is a very good background noise app, having quite a collection of choices. I particularly enjoy the feature of being able to overlay as many of them as I wish.",Quality app

5,2018-05-10 06:00:24,"I really like this app. It has a lot of great different sounds and it has timers and alarms that actually work unlike the other apps. And if you don’t get the premium part, you are really not missing out on much.",👍👍
4,2018-05-10 20:14:13,It’s a great app!!  I wish there were more noises available for free and I wish it was a little more organized but I definitely like how you get to pick the sounds and it has so many different aspects than just better sleep. It includes meditation for stress too !,Great app!

4,2018-05-09 03:51:54,I originally used this app to get my grandson to sleep now I use it to get myself to sleep.

Can't beat it for the price FREE!!!,Love the meditation
5,2018-04-06 14:35:49,Great app. I have used others and this one beats them all in my opinion. The sounds are awesome coming from my home pod too. Spend the money and get the lifetime subscription if it’s still available. Well worth it,Loving to relax
4,2018-04-21 03:29:37,"Better selection of sounds than any other app I’ve tried. Easy to mix and match, and to save. This has helped me fall asleep on business trips, when my mind is jogging around, and when I already feel relaxed. Recommended!","Great UI, lots of options"

5,2018-03-11 14:41:39,Whenever I sleep away from home I have a hard time staying asleep. I also always need noise. Since getting this app I use the Fan noise and I sleep through the night!,Better Sleep Away From Home

5,2018-02-07 04:54:00,I have a hard time falling back asleep especially after waking up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The sounds help relax me and stop me from thinking about the next day. They work every time.,Great sleep aid
5,2018-02-01 05:12:58,I enjoy nature sounds and this app lets me hear them even during the winter months where nothing really makes much noise outside. It’s so easy to just set a group of sounds and drift off to sleep or just to relax your mind,So Relaxing!
5,2018-01-26 13:01:27,"I’ve tried out a number of noise machine style apps (white noise generators, peaceful sounds, etc), and this is my favorite. The interface makes it easy to combine sounds, and both the quality and variety suit me.",Best Sound Machine App
5,2018-01-18 23:35:43,This is a wonderful way to add a serene background and drown out distractions. I use it at work to drown out office chatter. It’s also great when you’d like to read at home but the spouse insists on watching the evening news at sounds levels rivaling a Metallica concert.,Very useful app!
5,2018-01-15 15:08:55,"I use this primarily at work where.  I have obnoxious office neighbors who constantly play loud and disruptive music, through a set of party-grade speaks with subwoofer on a shared wall.  Not only does it help relax me, it’s customizable to suit any mood or environment.",Relaxing; great for people suffering from Misophonia
5,2018-01-11 08:39:17,"Once you find the right combo of sounds for you, it's incredibly lulling. Works quite well.  One of the few things I've found that really helps me calm my mind down at night.",Finding it very helpful for my insomnia.
5,2018-01-09 03:28:23,I love this app.  I just wish the meditations were organized in a different way.  Maybe they should  be collapsible by category?  I takes too long to fish through them the way they are now.,Great!
5,2017-12-16 22:09:48,"Many apps have sounds that have a short distinguishable pattern,  other than the music, this one does not,  the crickets and thunder sounds real and more restful!  My mind can actually relax instead of counting beats!",Great sounds without the repeat!
4,2017-12-22 04:10:59,"Of the nine sleep related apps I've sampled, RelaxM. is my preferred leader of the pack. The look, style & sound of the various creative sample selections were sleek as well as most effective above the rest. I appreciate the detail in length plus arrangement of each sound choice- which were cleverly looped for those insomniacs who tend to take a little more time to finally get the mental picture. I hope the company will continue to improve by expanding on all their positive attributes already mentioned and thereby succeed to the highest levels possible. Another grateful recipient, The Zound~Sleeper 😴 😉",RelaxM. Rating

3,2017-11-09 09:35:53,I love the sound selection and the way you can mix your own sounds. Only thing I don't like about it is that the settings buttons are very hard to click on and often end up hitting the ads. I know it’s probably designed that way so that you will hit the ads but still disappointing.,Good sounds

5,2017-07-25 03:35:33,"Mainly use this app to help me fall and stay asleep. I live in NYC, and there's not a lot of ambient soothing sounds to help me relax. This app certainly does the trick.

2,2018-06-18 19:40:39,"The sounds are a bit jarring and bulky for “relaxation sounds”. Works for intended use, as some of the melodies are softer than the others. Just hope they are the ones you NEED as opposed to the ones that happen to work. Sidebar: the app will offer you “new sounds”, but only if you give them a GOOD review. Pretty low and cheap. I’d be willing to bet that’s how they got so many five star reviews.",Good for general use
5,2018-06-11 05:56:33,"I love being in control of what I listen to, especially when going to sleep- and I love the lack of audio commercials, so my sleep isn’t disturbed! I’ll be upgrading to pro for the full version experience soon.",Great app!

5,2023-03-14 17:50:21,I literally can fall asleep by saying “I have no where else I need to be but asleep.”  I repeat that in my head and that’s the last thing I remember. I wish I could have all the  better sleep sounds without having to pay the money. It’s just not in my budget.   Thank you for helping me sleep. I’m actually about to take a nap now and my little cousin and I are listening to binaural beats with baby humming.   Sleep tight. 🥰,Thank you for hypnotizing me
5,2023-03-02 14:33:30,This app has some of the best rain noises out of everything I’ve tried. The extensive sound collection caters to my hyper specific city rain noise aesthetic. I absolutely love it.,Knock me out every night

4,2023-01-26 10:04:35,"i love this app and being able to put together multiple sounds to be able to fall asleep to is great. there’s also an option to track your sleep cycle and listen to audio recordings the next day. the only reason i didn’t give 5 stars is because i feel like there should be an option to have my sounds playing for longer than 3 hours because i almost always wake up when it stops playing. otherwise, great app",this app slaps
5,2022-11-27 04:12:19,"There are so many unexpected options and features with this app, I couldn’t be more pleased. It’s therapeutic just navigating the endless combinations of sound, mediations, and grounding techniques. Worth the investment!",Endless Possibilities

5,2022-11-16 08:04:28,"Makes it soooo much easier to fall asleep, stay asleep, and get back to sleep, if I wake up in the middle of the night!",Truly makes my sleep better
5,2022-10-29 05:47:37,I’m thoroughly enjoying this app. It’s a nice change from standard white noise or soundscapes as you can customize and layer sounds on top of one another. I’ve been sleeping like a baby.,Great sleep!
5,2022-10-16 07:08:37,If it’s not working.  Restarted my phone multiple times and it still won’t work. Updated as well…,Not paying for it…

5,2022-06-02 03:12:16,"Many uses but my favorite is to use it to fall asleep . Slow waves is relaxing , takes me back to the beach. I feel the warmth of the sun, and the crash of the waves puts me in a good frame of mind",Great app!

4,2022-05-23 18:20:29,I’ve used this app for a while and like it. However since the change to “Better Sleep” it seems you do have to pay for more sounds as there’s a lot of locked objects. Seems excessive.,Good App
5,2022-05-01 04:25:15,I’ve used this app for 3 days and my sleep has been better. My mood has improved. I recommended this app to my friend because it had really changed my energy,SO GOOD

4,2022-04-01 03:50:23,"Good selection of free sounds, wish there was a more broad selection because some of them can be a bit harsh for sleeping rather than background noise, but otherwise this works really well!",Good selection
5,2022-03-06 05:41:34,I always sleep with a fan on at home. When I travel I always use this app to have just the right level if white noise. Thanks!,My fan away from home
5,2022-01-01 19:50:53,For many decades I used to have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. This app has fixed all of that. It is wonderful to wake up in the morning and realize I slept all night!,Goodbye insomnia
1,2022-02-11 05:52:11,I got this app as a paid app before it was a yearly subscription. Have been a user for years. and now they want more money from already paying customers. there are sounds missing that I was able to use before. App has become a challenge to use because of all the “premium” sounds. In an app I already bought. Will not recommend.,Pay twice.
2,2022-02-11 00:43:16,"We have been using this app for years and the update today has made it crash every time I open it. I deleted, reinstalled, restarted my ipad, everything I know to do and it still crashes the moment I open it. Any ideas? We use this app everyday for naps and bedtime. It’s a life saver and I need it back please!",What happened?!
3,2022-02-05 09:35:11,"I am new and still experimenting on if this app has value. Do I want to pay more if it doesn’t work for me ? No. My feedback would be to wait before sending out a survey request. Give us more time to use the app, so that we can give an accurate rating.",Value
5,2021-12-02 06:37:23,Really enjoying this app. I love the stories. I listen to them to help me fall asleep . It also offers a wide variety of options. I’ve recommended to my friends,Fall asleep faster
5,2021-11-20 14:21:31,This app is not your ordinary noise maker app. It has all the sounds you would expect but it has mediations and adult bedtime stories that helps me relax before bedtime. The app experience is very pleasant.,Not your ordinary noise maker
5,2021-10-07 13:48:18,So I was looking for an app to calm my anxiety. This app does it for me. It takes my mind off things that causes me to freakout and rather soothes me. I love it. Its the best. I use it when going to bed to make it seem it like it's raining. Its pretty cool,Superb
4,2021-11-05 19:28:37,"Has a few quirks, such as extremely slow start, confusing UX (saved playlists are under mixes, not playlists), bizarre pseudoscientific claims about sound.   But it does what is needed: play white border for a given duration.",Quite good
5,2021-09-24 18:21:28,"I have so much stress in my life, Kidney Dialysis, Depression and anxiety. This app truly helps me to relax and be calm. I have panic attacks that hit me at night while I am trying to go to sleep so I listen to the app and it is amazing how fast I fall asleep.",Very calming

5,2021-07-20 08:11:55,"this app is a game changer. i struggle with falling asleep and when i tell u this works, it really does. within a few minutes i’m out. the timer is really nice so it turns off automatically. I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS FREE!!",insomnia
5,2021-07-20 05:52:02,I purchased a lifetime subscription because I immediately recognized the value that this product would provide through soundscape technology.,Exceptional
5,2021-07-10 17:19:14,I love the bedtime stories and the ability to create my own sound mixes. Haven’t found another app like this.,Helps me fall asleep every night
5,2021-07-01 12:36:21,I have trouble sometimes sleeping at night but I saw this app and had to try it out. I love it now since I have now woken up two days in a row feeling so much better!,Amazing app!
5,2021-06-24 03:26:16,"What an amazing app! This app can not only help you fall asleep faster, but help you go to bed on time. Relax Melodies also has a timer to help you wake up on time. I highly recommend this app.",Relax Melodies
5,2021-06-10 02:01:25,"I’ve been extremely stressed with work lately, so in turn was having problems staying asleep. Since I started using Relax Melodies, I wake up feeling rested.",Never slept better!!
5,2021-06-08 02:11:31,Hiiiii this is a review coming from a 6th grader I really like this app it helps me drain my stress and sleep and by the way I was thinking you should make a new sound I’m thinking tapping cups or something like that,This app Is the best
5,2021-05-27 02:50:41,"I’ve been using this app for 4 years and I love it. I can’t give a high enough rating. There’s so many options, even without premium.",Highly recommend
3,2021-06-01 18:33:28,"I bought the pro version of Relax Melodies years and years ago. It’s the best rain sound machine or white noise machine in the App Store. But I no longer have access to the sounds I bought. Instead they have this new subscription model. So, I’ve lowered my rating from five stars to three.",Great App But
5,2021-05-26 08:42:48,This app has helped me have the best sleep in the past few months and has been so much more beneficial in helping me sleep than sleep meditation while I battle with my insomnia.,Love this app
5,2021-05-20 02:52:59,I love the accessible features. It really makes the app so good. I appreciate all of the free features as well. It is very nice to fall asleep to. I’ve been sleeping safe and sound every night. Thank you!!,Love it!

5,2021-03-29 04:00:35,Not exactly the same as my Dohm sound machine but love that I don’t have to pack anything additionally on trips! This works perfectly and love how you can concoct your perfect sound mix!,Great app to replace sound machine
5,2020-10-04 02:42:18,"When I’m all geared up at bedtime, I put on my Relax Melodies I created.  It takes me back to the days of being a child, sleeping at my grandmother’s lake house with windows open.  The frogs and insect sounds were like a lullaby to me, then and now.",Really relaxing
5,2020-08-09 04:52:04,I use the campfire sounds through my Bluetooth speaker to make my propane campfire feel more legitimate.  I also play the crickets when someone at work talks too much...endless possibilities!,Great for sleeping away from home
5,2020-07-06 15:26:56,"Sometimes if I’m having anxiety it’s hard for me to calm down or sleep, this app helps so much! They have so many sounds to choose from and you can make your own melody to sleep too or meditate!",Helps me with anxiety
5,2020-07-05 06:24:09,I have have been using this app for years and it has always been amazing and gets better all the time. Thank you for being consistent,Been using for years
5,2020-03-06 07:18:20,"I use it every nite- I really like the timer- to shut the app down within a desired 'fallin asleep' time. The musica it plays sound really good, however it is kinda the norm on other apps. I would like the Zen noise to be a lil different, one of my favs!",Lovely App
4,2020-03-24 06:33:54,"My daughter and I use this app every night to relax and meditate before bed.  Unfortunately, most of the items that we would benefit from cost money and it is an expensive app.  I wish it was less expensive or they had more free options.",We love it
5,2020-02-27 04:57:06,I am BEYOND thankful that you guys enabled ALL the brainwaves in my current subscription as to before it made me pay extra similarly to the Fog Horn.  Thank you for restoring these on my same subscription! I will be more then happy to renew my subscription. THANK YOU,Updating my review and WOW
5,2019-09-27 05:38:17,Love this app! Its so nice to create my own sounds cause the ones online never worked for me. Plus they give you plenty of sounds to choose from so your not listening to the same sounds alk the time.,Relax Melodies
3,2019-12-25 04:47:03,"Absolutely love the sounds - they're great! My only problem is that I really want to subscribe to listen to the deep sleep  , but I don’t want to pay $60 annually & there is no other option. I wish I could pay month to month- even if I paid $8-10 monthly (which I’m willing to do), they’d come out making more !",1/2 & 1/2
5,2019-07-26 11:56:57,I use this when I travel and it helps me get to sleep easier. I am used to my husband snoring and I need some noise to help. I also like using it when I am reading. Nice to have some relaxing sounds to hear,Super sounds
3,2019-09-21 04:02:07,"I love the app, I love what it offers. I purchased this app prior to it being an annual subscription and every single update since has been problematic.  It started with not recognizing my subscription, they fixed that, then every update has required me to restore my subscription.  This most recent update wants to download items before allowing me to use it.   It used to just work. I travel and don’t have constant internet access and the application is starting to be more trouble than it’s worth.  Maybe it’s me being salty or maybe it’s time to replace it.",Every update causes problems
5,2019-07-11 16:09:09,"Can close out and still listen, even in free version. Love being able to customize and combine sounds. Doesn’t automatically end play after a period of time. Great features.",Great app
5,2019-06-23 05:56:29,I love this app. Its not like the other apps when you need a trial to use it. It also will play anywhere which is great so i dont have to be worried keeping it on for it to play. And there is great noises without using pro. This will help me a lot!,Great!
5,2019-05-08 14:27:44,This is s wonderful app. Started using it when I was having a lot of stress. Helped me get to sleep so I could deal with life better. Especially live the sounds that are customizable. Ocean sounds are my happy place!,Such calmness!
5,2019-01-27 13:59:29,I’ve used this app for a few years now and it’s been great. It allows you to mix your own relaxation sounds or you can choose from one of the pre- mixed sounds. Highly recommend.,Great app
3,2019-02-19 03:48:56,"App itself functions great, but the interface and selection of sounds could use some work. The interface requires a lot of scrolling back and forth, lots of tapping to adjust sounds. It could use some simplification to be more practical. The sounds are repetitive and feel cheap.",Mostly great
3,2019-02-13 03:44:00,I love this app so much I bought the premium package...however I am disappointed because I shouldn’t not have to repurchase until August of 2019 however i only have access to the free mediation guides..I’ve looked in the app support but it is not clear where to contact to get the full access back.. totally bummed 👎🏼,"Love this app, until..."
5,2019-01-19 08:04:02,"Other than buying the other sounds the deals aren’t bad, and even without the other sounds you can still make some good relaxing music, this helps me sleep!",Love it

5,2018-12-07 05:23:30,I love that you can combine or isolate sounds! You can also adjust the volume of each sound separately when you combine them. You can set a timer for how long you want the sounds to play. I love this app!!,Love it!!
5,2018-11-26 07:25:26,Has a lot of options to customize your experience. All the sounds are great quality. It still plays when your phone locks. You get to layer sounds and change the volumes.,Great free app
5,2018-11-22 23:45:27,So far it really enjoyed the app! There is a timer so you don’t have to worry about your iPhone running out of battery and I also like to listen to this app while I read a book.,Peaceful sleep 😴

5,2018-11-20 06:26:17,"I cannot go a night without these melodies. The sounds are so gentle, and I can customize what I’m feeling that evening. I love that it has a fade-out timer too, and I’m always lulled to sleep by the sounds before it even shuts off. I love it!💕",A Nightly Ritual: A Good Unbreakable Habit
5,2018-11-20 00:54:22,I’ve had bad insomnia for the past 12 years and sometimes relax melodies is the only thing that helps. It’s not going to work all the times but I’m shocked at how often it does. Thank you relax sounds!,Insomniac here
5,2018-11-17 06:03:38,"I use this when I travel and need to block out traffic sounds. The different sounds are a nice option to choose between just white noise or waterfalls, rain, etc.",Very relaxing!
5,2018-11-12 04:54:43,Love the sounds and the ways to mix them. Might consider paid version in the future. Also plays very nicely in the background of other apps like my meditation or storytelling one.,Great with meditation or storytelling

5,2018-11-04 05:35:41,Pleasant way to fall asleep.  Nice selection of sounds.  I don't use the guided meditations so can't comment on those.  Take time to familiarize yourself with the feature as there is more than what seems to be immediately apparent.,Sweet sleep app
5,2018-10-28 05:37:34,This app is phenomenal . It’s great for helping out my baby toddler to sleep on the go or at home . I work 3rd shift so I play it to help me go to sleep as well during the day .  The timed app exit prevents it from running down your battery .,Life saver for stressed mom
4,2018-11-02 03:29:01,Very Helpful app but the only reason I did not give 5 stars is that my subscription “disappeared” one day and I had to diligently search how to reactivate it. They make you work very hard to reactivate your account when I never suspended or canceled it in the first place.,Helpful but...
5,2018-10-27 13:54:45,First started using this app to help my kids relax to go to sleep. Now I often use it myself. It creates the perfect setting for quiet reflection. I especially like how you can adjust volumes of different sounds through the mixer.,Love this app

4,2018-10-25 04:58:23,"So I guess I like it. It makes me sad that the iPhone version seems to have a pro option that takes away half my sounds. Don’t get me wrong, there are still many options. But I had more on Android...or so it seemed.","Well, I’ve had it on 3 different phones"
5,2018-10-16 03:51:53,I was looking for something to put on when I couldn’t shut my mind off to sleep and this does it! I just pick what sounds I like that day and am asleep within ten minutes.,Relaxing
5,2018-10-16 02:17:44,"Has been a lifesaver in hotels or with friends in a house where you aren’t used to the noises. Use it often at home too for when I need to focus my mind. Great app, never had an issue with it!",Love this app for travel
5,2018-10-10 02:19:47,"Easy to use, love the customization, and all of the free options! I use this when we travel so I don’t have to lug my sound machine with us for my son ♥️","Easy to use, love the customization, and all of the free options!"
5,2018-10-04 08:03:13,I've used this app for almost two years.  It's wonderful for blocking out noise when you travel.  Pair it with noise cancelling headphones and you can *almost* forget you're on a plane... again :),Must Have
5,2018-09-27 16:12:49,"Been using this at night and when ""stuff"" hits the fan at work to help calm me down. I also like being my own relaxation DJ with the options of adding, changing volume of each component, etc. Great app!",Very Helpful!

5,2018-09-20 16:47:41,I downloaded this app for my baby. However I found myself using it as well. They have such a variety of sounds that you'll never have to listen to the same one twice. I love this app.,Great App

4,2018-09-12 06:19:46,"Good amount of sounds for the free version, I would much rather have a single payment then a monthly or yearly charge. I would give it five stars if it added a feature to play a sound for an amount of time, and then stop or fade out.",Over all good sound app
5,2018-09-09 03:51:10,"Pleasantly surprised by this app, didn't expect it to have the versatility it has, I like having the ability to mix various sounds and adjust the volume level of each for a customized melody.",Surprising results

5,2017-11-14 09:03:40,"For a free app it offers everything I’d want, ya the other options for a price would be nice to experience but maybe later when it’s worth the price",Wouldn’t try any other
5,2017-11-14 03:01:30,"I love the customization of being able to create your own combinations of sounds, and particularly the fact that the volume can be individually controlled for the different sounds. Brilliant!",Peaceful
5,2017-11-01 01:41:00,"I use this app every night, it’s really hard to find something nature that you can tweak to your liking. If you have a hard time falling to sleep, this app will be your best friend.",Perfect
2,2017-11-06 03:04:43,I grew very attached to this app due to my sleep issues. Now the past 3 days I’ve had to reinstall it just to get it to open. I’m having no other issues with other apps or any problems with my phone. It’s just this app. Beyond disappointing. Hope it’s fixed soon. I would like to go back to using it.,"Used to love app for years, now crashes"
5,2017-10-25 04:44:10,I love that I can completely customize the sounds in this app to meet my needs. It's super soothing & the meditation sections are especially great. AND there is a sleep timer so you can drift off to lala land without worry.,Customizable relaxation
2,2017-10-29 05:54:25,"I loved this app at the beginning. I grew an addiction and now have trouble sleeping without it, which is unfortunate because now maybe 10 seconds after the app being open, it immediately crashes. It’s been doing this maybe 3 or 4 nights now, and honestly? I miss this app. It worked for me and I loved it to death, but now I can’t access it!",Issues.
5,2017-10-21 04:10:07,"I love this app.  I sleep with a sound machine and when I travel....yep, I turn this beautiful thing on.  Best part it’s something I always have with me (my phone) and I can choose the sounds I find soothing.",Sounds
5,2017-10-19 03:44:31,I love this app I use the different sounds to help my kids get to sleep. They also like the different screens that provide soft glows. I even use it myself when I'm having a hard time falling asleep.,Great App
5,2017-10-15 05:14:20,Good variety of sounds to fall asleep to. Love that it includes a timer and the ability to change the different sound volumes layered on top of each other.,Great for relaxation and sleep aid!
1,2017-10-17 19:28:38,If you like music or repetitive noises while you sleep this app would be fine. But I tend to prefer generic white noise and that’s where this app strangely falls short. Even on the “white noise” setting you can tell when the audio loops and my mind starts focusing on the barely perceptible change that occurs at regular intervals. It would actually increase my concentration as I was trying to sleep. Installed a different app and no issues.,Mixed bag
5,2017-10-14 19:19:52,"I really enjoy this app! Before I'd been using strictly a rain sounds app, but this app has so many different choices, all with great sound quality. My favorite so far is the Monk Chant!!",Great quality sounds for free!
5,2017-10-12 13:49:23,I wanted an app to listen to while meditating and this had enough sounds (like ocean and rain) to do the job. I'll definitely use it for times of relaxation and mindfulness as well.,Exactly what I was looking for

4,2017-10-02 04:40:27,This app not only helps with putting someone to sleep but it helps with kids who have ADHD /add and need some soft music to focus. The free version of the app still gives u a handful of selections to listen to which is delightful. Definitely would recommend,A great choice
5,2017-09-26 14:47:54,I've gone through some life changes in which I slept a total of 8 hours during a 1 week period. The app helped me focus on the sounds of rain which allowed me to get a good deep sleep.,This helps
4,2017-09-27 02:44:15,I love all the sounds you get and how you can mix them. I love the meditating part as well. I just wish there weren’t so many sounds you can’t get unless you pay. At least I get 2 more for reviewing the app 😂,So great for when I’m trying to sleep...but
5,2017-09-24 09:14:34,This app has the most realistic sounds and many from which to choose. Don’t need to buy a sound machine from Brookstine or Sharper image any more. App is much better.,Realistic Variety
4,2017-09-26 07:29:45,Really good app at calming me down and allowing me to sleep easier. Just wish they would allow to sample the pro sounds so I would know if it is worth paying for or not. A sampling section would be beneficial and probably make them more sales.,Good app
5,2017-09-23 12:54:01,I use when traveling even commuting to help relax and steer away from too many nearby or loud conversations.  Variety of choices helps me find what suits my mood or day. I'm a fan!,Lots of Options

4,2017-09-06 04:27:23,It's a little confusing at first but great app overall. Love being able to mix the different sounds and how loud or soft I want each one to be. Helps me fall asleep and stay asleep so much better than I did before,Mix sounds to fall asleep
5,2017-09-01 01:56:51,It's a proven fact that people that can meditate have a higher learning capacity and do well in life I recommend the natural sounds to soothe your body and mind to sleep well or meditate. Excellent!,Relaxing soft natural sounds to your brain

5,2017-07-15 04:35:03,"This app is just about the best experience . My 8 year old son uses so many combinations of sounds and just enjoys it so much at bedtime. It really relaxes me as well when I turn in for bed, I know I have the melodies to transition into dream land.",Soothing
4,2017-08-10 02:23:53,I love this app! At night I can turn it on & turn the timer on & my toddler & I are sound asleep in no time! And it automatically exits the app after 30 min which keeps from running the battery down,Ease off to sleep

5,2017-07-04 18:49:04,Use this with our youngest. At 3 months we just mix up a pleasant combo of available sounds and she is off to sleep! Works pretty well on the adults at times too!!!,Such a good and helpful app
