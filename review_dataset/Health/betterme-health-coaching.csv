They  have to think about your physical health, age, and weight. Some exercises are just made for people who are fit, young or both. At the beginning the exercises are modified to a beginner, but then they get more challenging. The problem is that after months of exercising when you’re overweight and older, your knees start feeling the pain,  so I do recommend they stay on a modified exercise when it comes to putting all the weight on your knees or giving you the option within the app.   Also, it’s important to provide two feel good options because it helps you achieve that goal for that day, and also you have an option for those days when your life was crazy busy, active, and full of chaos.   Lastly, I have had many problems of it crashing down in the middle of my workout many, many times! This also discourages all the effort we put into a healthier lifestyle. I have even tried it several times, but it constantly crashes down. Also, I can’t even delete and reinstall the app because it might delete all my data. No easy fix for this until now.",We Want Change
4,2021-02-11 13:20:07,"With gyms closed, I decided to look for alternate at home exercises. I am in my late 20s and looking to keep an active and healthy lifestyle. This app has great options. I subscribed and I really enjoy the daily 'do your exercises' that fit directly in what I am looking for. I also like the 'workouts' section if I am looking to work a little more on a specific muscle group.   Yet, for me honestly I do feel that the food and dietary section is not useful to me. I am not looking for nutritional advice, im only looking for workout ideas so this to me is not useful. I would advice BetterMe to have a full seperate app just for nutrition and one just for workouts with the possibility of merging data from both apps together if the user wants to. Otherwise, a lot of the data on this is just not useful to some people. I do get the whole concept of being a full plan of food and exercise but thats my experience.   Another think I want to point out is the 'do your workouts' section of the Plan page. Some days it recommends walking, other days it recommends a full 25 minute exercise routine -which is exactly what i love about this app and why I subscribed to it. Yet, skme days when i check the 'do your workout' section it says 'today walking' it doesn't make sense. I suggest modifying the Plan page to include under the 'do your workouts' section a 'walking' subsection and an 'exercises' subsection. That way you get to have both new options everyday.","Enjoyable, needs a few improvements"
2,2022-07-28 15:00:43,"However, for a pay-for app, it is lousy. The food recording is ridiculous-good luck finding what you are looking for in the measurement that is reasonable. Many different measurements seem to have been done by a completely inept person/machine, having 5 different measurements that all say the same calories. Then, you HAVE to give access to every part of your health on apple in order for it to track your steps or to even log your weight? I don’t use apple health and don’t want to share my information with it. I can understand the steps but allowing just the step tracking to share does not work at all, it still requires you to share everything. What is the point of having separate sections if yo can’t allow one section. These issues render half of the app unuseable, add to the fact it doesn’t sync with Fitbit, and I def wouldn’t recommend this app for anyone unless you are only looking to read the little quips which are nice but so far are all information you can get free online in weight loss articles, just broken down in smaller bites. The water tracker is nice, and I haven’t tried the workouts yet since I use another app for those that is easing me into them. The daily log in award thing doesn’t even work correctly.  For 3 days it told me I was at “day 5” and then I updated the app and it sent me back to 1.   And despite what the response to my negative review says, it does not sync with Fitbit.  There is not even an option.",Maybe 3 stars if it were free.
3,2023-03-29 16:12:22,"The app has the potential to be so much more than it is.  Functions I appreciated: keeping track of nutritional intake, daily steps, weight , and a variety of at home exercise videos to do at your own pace and fitness level.  What I don’t appreciate: In the app it shows tracking heart rate, and sleep. A promo plug kept encouraging me to purchase a $60 better me fitness band to maximize all the above. Sadly that’s a lie. The band isn’t even fully compatible with their app yet. $60 wasted. The band took 6 weeks to receive which was a bit ridiculous.  Over all I lost over 15 pounds in 2 months but I contribute it all to managing calories because I only did a couple of the workouts a week due to being a night shift nurse with a limited amount of time to work out. I did reach out to them and they suggested fasting often which I already did, but not by choice.  I like the workouts when I can do them but I’m not sure if it’s worth the cost since I’ve yet to compare it to anything else.  I’d like to see compatibility to band and app, a better way to customize workouts to specific days vs daily reminders that I’m not working out. If I could workout more i would but I’m working 16 hours a day and sleep all day until it’s time to get ready to go back. I’d love to be able to set what days I can workout and then load a workout for that specific day.",Developers need to get the ball rolling
5,2023-04-16 01:54:59,"I downloaded this app based on Instagram advertising the wasted no time in signing me up for a subscription plan, so suffice it to say, my attendance were up to a possible scam. However, after a few weeks of using this up, I can confidently say it’s one of the best overall fitness apps around. Not only are there features like calorie and water trucking plus fitness and exercise, calorie burn counters that, well, how are useful, or customary for just about every iOS wellness app, the BetterMe app goes five steps beyond by creating customized meal plans for you inclusive of daily recipes that accommodate all major dietary restrictions and allergies (shocking for someone gluten-free, egg-free and nut- free, as well as paleo & pescatarian !!), the app also creates workout regiment for you that take into account injuries you identify in your initial survey (knees for instance) with great instructional videos.    Honestly, to say, I am gob, smacked by this up, would not be an exaggeration. I, feel like they have launched fitness software to rival even the likes of peloton and other major industry players without so none of the cost or icky branding.   I 10/10 enthusiastically recommend.",No lie—one of the best fitness aps around
2,2020-09-30 13:42:42,"This app has a lot of great articles, workouts, and recipes based on your preferences and needs. I enjoy the little quizzes you have daily, and the water intake tracker, but that’s really where the niceties end with this app.  Logging food is near impossible and not user friendly at all. The only measurements they have for most items is in ounces, and even then half the time it doesn’t pick up the fractions of an ounce you try to log in. Its food library is VERY limited, so good luck finding a barcode it will take. You’ll be entering in a lot of foods manually.     While the fasting countdown is a great visual to use, you can’t reset it. If you forget to hit start or stop, it keeps on keeping on. There really needs to be a way to adjust the times on it to be accurate. Plus, if you’re done eating, but not yet to the end of your eating window, you can’t start your fasting window early!  Sorry, but I don’t eat the ENTIRE 8 hours of my eating window. It’s like the developers don’t understand intermittent fasting?   To top it all off, it doesn’t sync up with fitbits. It’s not even an option. So unless you have an Apple Watch and/or want to carry your phone with you 24/7, your steps aren’t counted, and you can’t manually enter steps or workouts. Those 3 things are MAJOR fails for me as a user, and it’s very frustrating to know I paid to get a limited sliver of use from it. I really can’t recommend this app to anyone.",Does Frustration Burn Calories?
2,2020-07-09 03:13:07,"I started using this App yesterday. Already have huge agitations. Let’s start with the Calorie tracker. I have used other meal log/ macro Apps that are way easier and less time consuming. For example if I meal prep I should be able to copy the meals from the day prior into my next day of tracked meals instead of individually typing items all over again, the food items are scaled to Oz even though they are inputted as grams which is time consuming to go and covert the serving unit every single time. Now let’s talk about the workout. Day 1 was labeled Brazilian Booty in which there was no glute exercise. This is a full body workout that had abs and shoulders. The movements being demonstrated are jerky and fast lacking in proper form/technique. I DO HOWEVER enjoy the way the workout is designed so you can move along with it, timer and everything.  Water tracker, if I accidentally click too many times I see no way of deleting my mistake in order to accurately track water intake over time. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST the app opens you to another item to sign up for (which also costs) once you have already paid for the services, I chose one that says “ live coach access” where is the live coach ? Well I’ll see how I do in the end I already paid but I will be sure not to continue the subscription once completed. This app has such great potential just really needs to tighten things up for efficiency and accuracy.",Has Great Potential....
2,2020-09-12 13:53:47,"*Updated review: I was told there was a return policy that I didn’t qualify for. After I gave a negative review, I was offered a refund and then was asked to edit my review. Days later, I was asked again to edit my review. I suppose I am more pleased with my experience now that I was refunded. However, my original experience hasn’t changed. I believe the only reason I was refunded was to fix their reviews. I should have been refunded right away because I was dissatisfied with the products I purchased. I would rate their customer service at a 1 and the app itself at a 3 so I will   meet in the middle and raise my rating to 2. I won’t lie and give a rating I don’t feel is true. Rating are a way for customers to get the truth before spending their hard earned money. This isn’t just a $1.99 purchase, people should know what to expect.   Original Review: I purchased the app but it was not at all what I expected. The ad was misleading and it didn’t function at all as expected. I requested a refund and they just kept replying without answering me about the refund. They finally sent me a link to their refund policy which basically told me I needed to follow the suggested diet to a T for a period of time, yet request a refund within a certain time, leaving very little time to do so. By the time they FINALLY sent me the return policy, it was too late. Waste of money!! Won’t refund if you are unsatisfied.",Edited review after refund
4,2020-05-14 06:04:24,"So when I started using this app (more routinely) in March I was 160 lbs now I am 146 so it works. I love the exercises and the meal plans it’s honestly an amazing app but it could be better. I don’t like that the exercises just jump from one to another. It would be really cool if somewhere in the corner you put “up next: ______ exercise” with a photo or video of the next exercise so I’d be a little more prepared. Also sometimes I can’t see my phone when I’m exercising so some type of ding when you switch workouts or a “3,2,1” kind of count down or something to let me know we’re switching exercises would be helpful. Another thing is I started the sugar free challenge and I’ve been clean since I started but I forget to mark down that I had a successful day and it automatically puts me as failed and it can’t be changed. That’s a bummer and it really brings me down because I know I’ve been trying. Other than that I really love this app it’s honestly helped me so much to change my lifestyle. Another suggestion is I would love if this app could remind you to drink water as well as workout! I really think this app can go places.",Love but could be better
3,2023-08-12 12:24:38,"Workouts are mostly great. It helps to hear and follow along without having to stare at the phone for what’s next and when to transition; however, there are a lot of errors. The app should allow for quick feedback by workout because it’s weird when you are doing a completely different exercise based on audio than is demonstrated on video, or you do the same exercise multiple times on the right as instructed thinking you’ll come back to left and never do, etc.  Also I purchased the 30-day toned tummy challenge for $4.99…has no narration that explains the move and no transition warning, so unless you are staring at the phone, you cannot follow along with ease.  Haven’t seen enough at home fitness that caters to the use of just hand weights. Many at home workouts refer to equipment needed like machines (or two) in a gym. Have to click on each workout to see what I can do with the equipment I have at home.  I tried to use it for food tracking but felt like other apps had better functionality.  Also responsiveness to questions is the worst I’ve seen. Then when they finally respond, you’ve moved on to something else. At this point, I could use great workouts and device connectivity to other popular apps.",Workouts mostly great but service is bad
2,2023-03-18 18:40:26,"This app was highly recommended to me by a friend. I am now reconsidering that friendship. On the surface, it looks like a great resource. I did like the motivational articles and notifications. But that is where the like died. The food database is absolutely horrid. Macros are not given for over half of the foods and your commonly entered foods are not saved for a quicker add.   I tried to do the exercise plans, but when I would rate something as not for me due to previous injuries, no modifications were ever put into place. I ended up using my Apple Fitness app. I added the meal plan thinking it would be a great tool to get me jump started on my journey. It looked like a 12-year old made that plan. Steak and vegetables, chicken and vegetables, the same breakfast and lunch options repeated each week. And oh, look! Squid?!?!?   I tried to cancel both subscriptions and the interface is so horrid, that it’s next to impossible to do. I cannot believe that I let this thing turn me into a Karen. I have learned my lesson. Never pay for an app again, especially without reading the reviews. I have gone back to My Fitness Pal and have actually started to lose weight. Going back to that friendship, however, will probably not be happening.",Only gets 2 stars because of the different checklists and motivational notifications
1,2020-11-03 21:52:05,"UPDATE: The developer reached out to me after I wrote my review and after free emails back and forth, they kindly refunded my money. I appreciate their customer service and no hassle.   Original review: This app has some good features, but it's not user friendly. I like that there is a ""to do"" list each day, but you can't customize what options are in the list. I'm a nursing mom, so fasting is not an option for me, but I am unable to turn off that feature. Adding the food I've eaten in the calorie counter is pointless because it barely recognizes any food I try to enter. I end up bluffing my way through it just to get a rough estimate of my calorie intake. And, most of the measurements are in ounces. My fitness watch is linked, but my step count isn't updated with it. It seems I have to have my phone with me just to have all my steps counted properly. I like being able to record how much water I've had to drink, but I can't seem to change my goal. I like that there are several fitness options, however I haven't tried a single recipe. I don't have time to go shopping for specific food and make a meal for myself... I have 4 kids and they're not going to eat these meals! I'm really frustrated that I paid for this app. It seems totally different than what was advertised (I signed up through a link in Pinterest). A free trial wasn't even an option.","Not User Friendly, good customer service though"
2,2020-07-01 13:11:05,"I got the app years ago & have been in a love/hate relationship with it since. When it first came out the exercises were not as detailed as they are now and I was impressed with the updates they made until the most recent update. I started using the app faithfully (with a faithful monthly subscription) since March but since the last update, last week I believe, every time I open the app their challenges pop up and I have to click on joining one just to be able to get to the home screen. I refuse to pay an extra $10-30 for a challenge when the app barely allows me to enter my meals daily because elf the limited food selection. I shouldn’t have to go through the challenges just to get to the home page to perform my workout, log my weight for the week, or log my water for the hour.  Update: I agree with other reviewers, this app is a scam! It’s not worth the $9.99/month. The calorie counter section does not include many options the barcode scanner does not pick up barcodes leaving you to enter them on your own. It does not let you go back and fix previous day entries (i.e., water intake from the previous day), if you do a different workout aside from the one assigned to you in the app or in a different app it does not count towards your progress for the day. It is pt worth it.","Like the App, Hate the Update & SCAM!"
2,2020-02-08 16:51:10,"Though the idea of this app is exactly what I want, the follow through on it has been awful. For starters, the food logging system is just pitiful, you all dont have the brand options that other apps do, and it makes it very hard to accuratley track my meals. Tracking my meals has been made significantly harder too because you all use a slider for the calories. The slider does not work as it should, because it moves as soon as you lift your finger. And even when you do get it to stay where you’ve put it, the slider locks in on what appear to be very arbitrary numbers, meaning that you can’t EVER get an accurate reflection of your calorie intake. I would also argue that this slider feature would make this app impossible to use for people with any sort of disability that limits their dexterity, and for individuals with poor eyesight or diseases that cause their extremities to shake.   I have sent the above information directly to the contact listed in-app, and I would like to say that if the developers changed these two things (the slider, and the sub-par food database), as well as the lack of reasonably priced/attainable ingredients in their in-app recipes I would be willing to give the app another try and probably rate it 5 stars, but until then I’ve got a year long subscription to an app that I can’t use properly.","Great idea, poor execution"
2,2020-03-28 07:37:49,"The set meal plan and exercise regimen is an awesome idea, and I think the workouts were pretty good and the recipes were fairly simple too. But there are way too many bugs for the price of this app. For almost a week, I wasn’t able to access the exercise videos, which is the main feature I was using. Then today I logged on and it said that my subscription had expired while I was still paying. So I cancelled my subscription and go figure even though I had paid through the 1st of April I can’t use the app any longer. I think the developers are more interested in making money off of people than providing a quality app, which is a shame because they could get so much business during this quarantine situation. Another thing is you cannot change the meal plan you are using or at least it takes a while to actually change. So that’s kind of annoying. If you use the keto plan, I checked and the recipes contained more than the 20 carbs that you’re supposed to be eating a day, so it wasn’t truly keto...  But fortunately, if you have a Fitbit, Premium subscriptions are now free for 90 days, so I would just use that.  One thing that was nice was that on the Facebook page they have been posting workout videos almost daily recently, so I’ll give them that.","Great content, too many problems with the app"
3,2020-07-23 23:16:21,"I really wanted to give this a try. Had the free version for a while so said why not. The workouts are tailored to your goals which is rlly a nice touch and different than any other app I have used. They get points for that. But! And it’s a big BUT. After purchasing there’s not really anything added from the free version aside from simple log/tracking, most of which it just grabs from the iPhones health app anyway. You get these ads for extra “challenges” that are like 30-60$, not included. The tracker doesn’t let you log your own work outs which you will need to do some Bc theirs feels like it misses a few things. It tends to force quit when doing the outdoor walk/running work outs. The meal logging also makes you do some guess work as to the weight of any item you eat so it’s not so accurate.. That being said, You will end up using several other apps to fill in where this one fails. They do have a great IG account with plenty of challenges and food/diet recommendations. They have a support person on your account you can reach out to as well which is nice. But again, There’s no reason to spend your money here, the price is kind of outrageous for an app considering how much better the competition is in this space.",Not worth the $

I’ve emailed or tried to leave a comment about this but no one has gotten back to me. I want to like the app as it was keeping me exercising for at least 15 minutes a day or more but frustrated that I can’t track my progress and that my attempts to get it resolved have been met with radio science as no one will get back to me! Billing me didn’t seem to be an issue and the only communication I’ve had. I do however like how you can log calories weight other exercises and that the exercises on the app are pretty simple but some don’t seem very safe and can leave my back hurting. I think if I didn’t have a few years of pilates under my belt to keep my core strength I could have I injured myself with some of the not so great descriptions of how to do them. Please someone get back to me about how it won’t record my exercises. And when a bill is coming up it would be nice to get a reminder.

The customer service was quick and I’m pleased with that. . . . . . Well I paid for 3 months for a program that claimed to be geared toward metabolic typing— it’s not, claimed to have great meal plans that are really just lists of recipes with no actual guidance as to why they’ve chosen these meals, no shopping lists, nothing. And their money back guarantee is a JOKE. You cannot go through the App Store and have to send them multiple ridiculous screenshots. SAVE YOUR MONEY and use any other free app out there. I wouldn’t call this a scam, but it’s completely useless and misrepresented. Also, there’s some sort of comment from the developer saying they can’t find peoples emails? That’s not something that is even asked for upon cancellation. If these developers aren’t trying to just keep peoples money dishonestly, they’re doing a great job of acting like it.",worthless “plan”

If not, I recommend those who love the app purchase only a one-month subscription rather than waste money on a lifetime one, since you only get a month’s worth of workouts anyway.  Three stars instead of five as a result of this issue.  Tempted to move it to two.  Update: the developer’s response was misleading and entirely inadequate. They responded to my complaint about only having 28 workouts by noting that there are 7 different programs.  These are in fact only the “arms”, “legs”, “abs” etc. sections, each one containing only 4-5 moves and lasting roughly 5 minutes.  You have to combine all 7 to get an actual, full workout, and there are only 28 total.  Once you have completed the 28, there are no additional workouts. If you’re serious about getting in shape, don’t get this app. You will only get in shape for 28 days. After that, you’re on your own.

I work extra 20 hours or even more every week, it was really difficult to fit a full-blown training session into my daily schedule. It became the least important priority, and I regularly skipped training instead of regularly exercising. This app was a game-changer for me. There is no way I don’t have 15 minutes to train every morning. Plus, the workouts continuously change so I don’t get bored. I usually like to go at my own pace, and it seems to me that the system in the app motivates you to push harder, but it is not a problem at all. I measure my changes each week, and I can say that I got much leaner than I was a month ago! It is actually much easier to extend your sessions once you get used to the short ones.

Problem is, and I’ve emailed customer service about this, there are errors in either the ingredients or the recipe. They don’t always match up. Example: the ingredients will mention one vegetable and the recipe never mentions that veggie or what to do with it. Or the recipe will say heat oven to 180 degrees, (180?) and Carbs 25 minutes. Carbs?  Do they mean cook?  I’m assuming , yes. Photos don’t always match recipe: strawberries in photo, but pears in the recipe. I just feel that the editing is poor. And if the meals are not edited, what else might be incorrect. That being said, I like most of the program. Not love, but like. The workouts and articles are good. The logging of the recipes could be better when it comes to scanning a barcode for nutritional value. The MyFitness app scans and all the info pops up immediately.

You can choose the type of workout you like to do (run, home workouts, gym etc.) but it only lets you select 2 options. I do think the app should make an option to have the workouts run through instead of having to hit next or skip to continue. The meal planning is a nice feature but this is where I have an issue. Not a day in my life have I attempted to make an open chicken, squash and ricotta ravioli topped with brown butter sauce. I feel that the meals should be more simple than a recipe that just sounds nice. Especially right now during this quarantine when shopping isn’t the easiest. Meals and water intake are on a preset sliding scale so not much room to customize the actual numbers.   Also, I feel that a trial would be beneficial.

My husband and I had been dealing with infertility for 10 years and I know I felt solely responsible. We had a talk about trying IVF and I decided that I was probably not at a healthy weight to be considered for it. An acquaintance suggested this app, so I downloaded it and hit the workouts and calorie tracking hard. I feel that I saw results pretty quickly and was super excited to be on the right track to healthy! Two months into using this app, I started looking into clinics that offered IVF. I didn’t need to though, because the same month I discovered I was pregnant. We welcomed our daughter at the end of October 2021.

If I am eating a cheese stick on the go, I have no idea how many ounces it is. If you scan it on the app it may show up as a kraft Colby cheese stick, but you still can only document it in ounces.  You can’t just log one cheese stick with the correct nutrients. Several items I have used are not in the database.  If you have to manually enter the item, you can only enter the calories.  When watching carbs, proteins, and fats, only being able to record calories is not efficient.  All the food that is not in the database for this app are in the database on other apps with accurate measurements.  Any challenges you want to do have to be paid for on top of the regular cost.  The program is not that well set up to account for the cost of using it.  There are much better apps available that are significantly cheaper.",Not worth the money you have to pay
2,2023-10-12 14:58:27,"To start: IF YOU HAVE STRUGGLED WITH ED, DONT GET THIS. I was anorexic for years, weighing only 94lbs at 5’2. I was calorie counting and constantly weighing myself. It took a lot for me to heal and now I’m a healthy 140 after 2 children. I love my body, I feed myself like I’d feed a loved one. I’m still uncomfortable with my breast size but the rest of my body is easy to move and carry on day to day life. I’m happy to wear anything. I’ve had 2 surgeries this year and I’d love to strengthen my core again, where my surgeries were performed, after allowing myself sufficient rest. Instantly, this app begins by telling me I’m “overweight” according to BMI (proven to be archaic at this point.) I just wanted an app to give me guided workouts, especially those that may help release emotions and trauma. Instead I got diets, calorie counting, BMI shoved in my face. Even the intro audio on beginning is toxic telling me I struggle to say no to an extra slice of pizza. I’m still waiting to see the actual work outs assigned to me, but I’m already hating how this app makes someone feel. It’s no wonder so many women struggle with image and disordered eating. I’m not going to be on my death bed wishing I had said no to a second slice of pizza",Predatory
5,2020-09-21 19:59:58,"This is an excellent app for weight loss, tracking calories intake, water intake, as well as workout and daily steps. I am doing the 16hours intermittent fasting and amazed by the results in terms of weight loss! I honestly never imagined an app would keep me as motivated as I am today as I usually lose motivation when it comes to healthy cooking and prepping meals. This worked out well because It lets you select the time you want to spend prepping meals and the ingredients you prefer using, so the suggestions for the Keto plan I chose are working great with my schedule, similarly to the exercise portion of it. The only thing I wish was easier to do is the food tracking, I wish it had a feature to group food in a recipe so I can use it another day if I made this recipe again, also if it had a history of the most recent items I used or the ones I keep reusing.  The last thing (and it’s not as important) but could be improved, is the ability to add fractions the your weight when you log in.",Very Motivating!
1,2020-05-06 06:42:51,"I thought this would be a great option to help with accountability and extra guidance through my health journey. I signed up for the 3 months of fitness and food, totaling $50... however, cataloging meals is pretty nuts, everything defaults to the same ounces when scanning upcs, so u have to change everything, there’s no way to add recipes or extra nutritional information... I’ve had a lot better calorie counter apps and just wanted the daily workouts, but realize after only a day or two that this app isn’t really helpful at all and has very little customization compared to other apps. Also there was no option for a workout that couldn’t be done... for example, the workout today should have been a 10 min walk, but I don’t own a treadmill and it was pouring rain outside, there was no way to swap for something else. I wanted to cancel and get some money back, but unfortunately I’m stuck with the loss of my $50 until my months are up. Thankfully I know to go into my Apple account and cancel when the time comes so I don’t get charged over and over and using this app has caused me to research and download several other similar apps in hopes of finding one that’s got less kinks and will be a better fit.",Wish I had selected the lowest option...
4,2023-10-19 13:33:53,"The app does an adequate job of helping you keep everything you need to track in one place for the most part. The calorie tracker is very frustrating and time consuming to use however. Simply adding functionality for it to automatically resurface items you’ve tracked before (many of us fitness folks are creatures of habit) like other apps do would go a long way. Instead, it only “remembers” the last 10 things you tracked and after that you have to start from scratch with a new search. Entering key search terms like brand name and item produces an at times seemingly random list of things with the same names and different calorie counts. It takes 3x longer to track a meal than it does with MyFitnessPal and a lot more concentration, sometimes even requiring me to look stuff up online and compare. I’m keeping the app for now because of the exercise program, but unless the tracking becomes a lot more user friendly it’s not a long term solution given the cost.",Decent but the calorie tracker is lacking
1,2020-08-21 22:13:50,"Everything cost extra. Wanna do some face yoga? Pay. Wanna avoid sugar? Pay. Even recipes say they are locked then ask you to pay, but you can not. The pictures don’t match the recipes. If you log food it has all sorts of store bought stuff to choose from but that’s not what I’m eating because I’m trying to lose weight. I like the scan the barcode of food option but why does it automatically log 3.53 ounces of everything. You can change weight but it lets you click on once’s as if you can change it to grams or liters or? and a menu pops up but there are no other options. This app is ok if you are vigilant about not paying extra but its not worth the price and then they have the nerve to wanna charge extra for all sorts of options. It’s crazy. The only thing I think is worth paying extra for is the personal trainer. But I never would bc this app seems desperate to over charge you and I would not trust them to be clear about your actually getting upfront. I’m already not pleased with what I did pay for.

1,2023-08-03 18:48:10,I downloaded it thinking I was getting “bettermen” app with a military training program. Instead it was this. 3m for $20. The daily challenge I joined was HIIT 30 day and it doesn’t even exist! There are no workouts to it? I hate the food library/log. It’s the most inaccurate one I’ve ever seen. You also can’t save your favorite items for quick additions. Measurements are limited as well. Won’t be using it. The workouts are okay. Videos are good quality and they explain how to do the exercise but very uninspiring. Robotic. There are lots of types of training from yoga to senior to boot camp. But why do I need those I didn’t sign up for those? I signed up for a military style regiment. There’s only about 10-20 workouts per category. It records the activity of the workout. I gave it full permission to my health app. I wish you could filter workouts by equipment. I workout at home. I have only dumbbells. But I can’t find any workouts with just dumbbells. It’s only by category. Some workouts have equipment that I don’t have. It’s very limited for home workouts. The reading and advice is probably the best thing this app has to offer. It is motivating. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone.,Not as advertised-very misleading

With being home recovering and with the pandemic; this 5’5 foot person was OUT OF CONDITION  and feeling miserable. I couldn’t get through my day without sugar be it candy or cakes or ice cream.  I was eating junk food for my meals. My only exercise was from a comfy chair to the fridge or pantry and back. 😬😎  I don’t have those cravings anymore. I have followed this program with ease. It keeps me on track and I am down 7 pounds. I expect to be 130 by end of September.  I am never hungry between meals and the exercises are awesome. You put as much energy as you’d like for 15-18 minutes and your done.  You can add more if you’d like.   I like to walk and add  walking every day.  Something I couldn’t do before my back surgery.

2,2023-08-07 11:57:16,"My 1st Pilates workout with Better Health and I am pretty disappointed.  After going through a whole survey so the workouts are “designed” to fit your level of mobility, I was really quite disappointed.  I have a double hip replacement but I’ve done all kinds of workouts before and since the surgery.  The skill level that I picked was easy, beginner, low impact, etc.  The moves themselves were not the problem at all, nor was the pace per se.  The problem is the transitions from standing to floor.  How can you transition randomly from a standing move, to a lying position move?  For one it doesn’t prompt you that the next move is sitting/standing.  Second, even the position of the mat is different between moves.  This does not make sense at all.  Not just for myself,  who needs extra time to transition from standing/sitting, but I can see this being a major flaw for many “beginners” that can’t just hop up and back down every 30 seconds, and most certainly not be able to complete the workout in 15 mins with the pauses and adjustments that you need to make to perform the simple move!",Terrible translations from the beginning
2,2021-11-27 01:31:58,"I’ve used several health apps over the years and  thought I’d give this one a try after seeing an ad. I was prepared to potentially waste $40 if it wasn’t as good as it appeared. Aaaand…  It’s not. I found the process to track food cumbersome. The barcode scan didn’t work on a single food I tried and many foods weren’t found in the database at all, so I had to manually enter the macros. No ability I could find to copy a meal, so I had to go through the same annoying process of entering each component of my breakfast every morning. After Day 3 of that, I’d had enough. Other features, such as weight and exercise tracking, were difficult to navigate to and set up. Nothing user friendly at all about this app. $40 blown. That they don’t offer a 7-day trial should tell you something.   There are far better options out there, so I’d suggest googling “best health and fitness app” and reading a few articles to find one. That’s what I did and found a far superior option for about the same investment.   Oh, and I find the responses BetterMe gives to critical reviews here annoying. Don’t blame the reviewer, folks; make a better app.",Meh. Not worth it
3,2018-06-13 21:59:55,"The workouts are awesome and I like that the app shows you how to do the workout as you are doing it. I also like how it tells you how many calories you burned at the end of each workout. The workouts are targeted towards specific problem areas so you can tailor your workouts to your needs.   However, the diet part of this app needs a lot of help. There is no way to put food preferences in to avoid seeing those recipes (ex I don’t like quinoa or beef liver). Also, not all the recipes match. The directions will be for something other than the recipe or ingredient list. The ingredient list doesn’t always tell you how much of something you are including in that recipe (ex 1 piece cottage cheese - what does that mean?). Calorie counts per meal are not included. I would expect this from a free app but not one for $10 a month. I’m on my free trial right now and I’m not sure I want to pay for this unless it was fixed.   I see other people leaving similar reviews back in December and it’s now June. Please developers: fix the app!

3,2018-04-16 19:02:49,"I’m enjoying the app so far but there have been a few exercises that didn’t make sense just based on the graphic. An option to select more information before starting the day’s exercises would be nice. Also, being able to actually track the meals eaten rather than just a menu to look at. I love that it has the recipe provided for the meals, being able to build a favorites list of recipes would be awesome!  After reading other reviews, I checked out the billing and it does seem pricey for what is offered ($10/mo). Mine had the 6-month automatic $42 subscription selected already, so that would have been a crappy surprise. That does lower the price by $3/mo though, so I can see the benefit and will likely leave it that way. An earlier warning about the price would be good though, I’ve seen other apps put the subscription prices in the app description, so people don’t feel deceived when their account is automatically charged.  The app itself is beautiful and I like the target areas. Some of the meal choices are a little different haha, you guys must really enjoy livers! 😁",Needs more instructions

There is only the option to login with my email. ‘No problem,’ I thought. I’ll set up an email login in my iPhone so I can login on my iPad. Reader, you can’t. There is no way to set up an email login if you signed up with an Apple ID login.

I’m a single person and I don’t want to go grocery shopping daily OR be throwing away food because I’m buying 50 different things. I think the small portions and cooking for certain numbers of people need to be considered when making a meal plan.

No warning at all my trial was ending. A simple email received after they already took my money was ridiculous. And heaven forbid you actually want customer service to give a crap. They have been fighting to keep my money even though it was only hours after they took it that I tried to cancel the service. They offered to give me six months free then offered me half my money back! I want all my money back and I don’t want their service if this is how they treat people!

While in the store, every time I would try to select an item to check off that I’ve gotten it, the app would crash. I then had to go through the store memorizing what I did and did not pick up yet to ensure I got everything. This led to me spending two hours in the supermarket for something that could have been finished in one hour. After having this difficulty I still used it to prep for my first full meal day using the recipes. Everything went smoothly until the next day I began to get ready to prep again, and this time the app wouldn’t even load in. It has now been two days.

I had paid for one month. When I finally had time that week I went to the app and I was forced to go to a chat with a private trainer.. I wouldn’t mind if it was just a chat you had whenever you had questions or they occasionally checked in on you, but for my experience, I had to go through the chat first. Once I had dealt with that, I had to log what I ate before I could go to the workouts. I hadn’t eaten much and from what I remember didn’t have much to log. By the time I dealt with that (along with multitasking other things) I didn’t have time for it. This happened a few times. I just decided it wasn’t worth it so I canceled my subscription and got rid of the app. Guess they remembered my card cause I got charged for another monthly subscription and I can’t log in on the app. So if you’re like me and you have no time, and don’t want to have to talk to a trainer before the workouts then don’t get it.

It is a perfect option for you if you don’t like gyms but want to melt some excess fat.

The calorie tracking is off, they offer you recipes with the option to press “log” but pressing that does nothing. You still have to manually log in the meal. It’s very frustrating. I like the fitness training portion of it but it’s not guided by voice or ANYTHING. so you have to stare at your screen to see when the time is up and you move on to the next exercise .rearing your neck around to check the time is counterproductive. Plus you have to manually press next through a lot of the warmups . So basically you kind a need to hold your phone or have it so close because you need to touch it to proceed.

I’ve been very pleasantly surprised by all the content, and the support has been amazing. I expected a one-style-of-workout deal, but there’s a wide variety of workouts, from HIIT to dancing in high heels. All of the moves are well-explained and a workout is usually enough to feel energized that I’ve done something, but not so tough it leaves me in a puddle on the floor. There are a few tweaks that need to made, but BetterMe seems to be working on scaling up pretty quickly.   Another thing that makes BetterMe so useful is being able to download the workouts in advance. I’m in a very rural area, and my home internet isn’t always up to streaming, but that same slow connection will let me download the workout and then play it.   Not being able to download in advance is  actually why I dropped every other fitness app I tried. I’ve tried a lot. Some of them said you could download the workout, but even with a good connection the download would take an hour or so. These downloads are usually less than 15 minutes on my bad connection (as long as I have any connection at all).   A solid five stars for this one!",So much more than I thought I was getting!

Nothing is customized, preferences don’t matter, and once you make initial selections there is NO going back. It asks you about preferences and goals yet still gives the same basic generic plan to every user. Allergic to a food? You’ll either get over it or not eat, because it will be in your plan multiple times daily. You not a fan of eating all day and want to choose intermittent fasting? Too bad, because with this app you’ll get a meal plan filled with several large meals and snacks daily. Accidentally choose the wrong diet type? Oh well, locked in for life.

2,2023-01-29 01:29:12,I tried the 30 day wall Pilates. The exercises were fine. Very doable. My problem is the app holds the videos hostage. There are 26 videos in the 30 day program. Each day you’re allowed the next video. You can’t progress to the next one for another 24 hours. Also if you skip one day your screwed bc you will never catch up because after 26 days they start you back over to number 1! So just as I was getting to the more challenging videos the thing started back at number 1 again with no option to open the videos I had been through before!   I reached out to the customer service and they just verified that this is how the program works. I think this is completely unacceptable. I only was able to get about halfway through the program before it reverted to video 1. So if if you’re planning on trying it for 30 days know that that means you need to do a video a day 7 days a week. Most app give you the 30 videos upfront and let you keep them afterward. Not here. Use it or lose it!,Very disappointing!

Reasons for not giving a 5 are, iPhone and IPad apps don’t work together. App should be device neutral-  Use the devise you have and have any activity or workouts sync up.   Also app is a little buggy with playback of some workouts with no prompts or visuals. Just ticks down the time  remaining in the exercise.   Also, profile asks for focus areas yet always provides the same types of workout recommendation even with all areas selected…Arms. I would expect that if more than one focus area was selected, that the recommendations would not always be arms. I don’t have the time to preview the possible workouts everyday to pick the one I want. Want the app to do that for me based on the focus areas selected.   Lastly, scheduling reminders for workouts if setup, should also drive when workouts at suggested. I use the app to supplement Taekwondo training twice a week. I’d like to not get workouts on those days but the schedule doesn’t really do anything other than pop up a message. It should have those days as off in the suggested workouts.

I downloaded another fitness app to compare and see which one I’d like to stick with for subscription.   The biggest thing that stands out is that BetterMe does not have an option for manually documenting your weight, and doesn’t have a lot of foods saved by scanning the barcode on items. Also, I have to spend a lot of time each day tracking down my regular food items since they get booted out of the Recent food selection. Logging daily calories should be easier than this. I like so many other things about the app and would happily stay with this product if they can provide an update on the weight & calorie tracking.","Great app, needs food log updates"
1,2023-03-07 09:35:14,"The ad’s are convincing. There is no free version. I had to start a dispute to cancel my membership. There is no free trial. Everything is an upgrade or extra fee. No modifications for those of us with injuries (although specified) You cannot tailor it for “you” and the workouts are unlocked daily, so you have to pay for tomorrow’s- if you can’t do it due to physical limitations that day was a waste. The diets are chosen by 4 groups, no modifications, like their workouts. I asked for a refund, they offered me two months. My suggestion is to use one of the other free apps and not get trapped here. I will say that their customer service took fantastic business communication classes and can say, “we are sorry you feel this way… we encourage you… and it’s our goal…. Not to mention the famous, “thank you for your feedback, we strive to improve and value our customers and their experiences” but they don’t because as you read the reviews, not one refund was issued, not one problem was resolved. It was only “sorry.” I’ll leave this here- it was a great idea that needs a ton of improvement.",Skip it
3,2023-07-13 17:25:02,"Overall, a pretty solid app for giving you exercises to do at home (8/10), and decent health tracking (6/10). This app is all about breadth, not depth.  How their workouts work is that they have thousands of ~30 second clips (e.g crunches, ice skaters, mermaid stretch) that they stitch together to create a ton of pretty good workouts.  The workouts are where it shines. The calisthenics, boxing, ab workouts are all stellar. There are some UX glitches (no audio for some exercises). Quite frequently, they’ll say “hold for 30-60 seconds” when the countdown is 10-20 seconds.  That said, there are some concerns about the workouts. The calorie count is a total sham. Pretty sure they assign random digits to the clips. I just did the EASIEST, most pathetic yoga flow (called Calorie Burner, but trust me when I write it was literally just mountain pose and child pose for about 7 minutes) and it said I burned 180 calories.  The diet feature is good. They have a ton of foods to track, and you can edit portions etc. But then part of their daily routine is a mindful listen or read, which is great in practice. But the diet ones can be misleading. Eg, grapes are awful for you with this App—even though food science says grapes are great for you: high in potassium, fiber, and full of water so you get full faster.  Overall, it’s great for giving me a diverse array of workout routines when I’m stuck at home or traveling.","Solid app, but some workouts and diets need improving"
3,2020-05-18 18:10:18,"This is a great app. I really do love it but there are some major flaws. When I first got it I was really looking forward to the exercises but when I started doing them I realized that there was no time to change positions. You’ll be standing doing one exercise and they expect you to already be on the floor and ready for the next one in less than a second. Also it says that this app is supposed to be for people who are trying to lose weight but use who are out of shape and not ready for all this bendy stuff it’s really hard to keep up. I personally am not able to pretzel myself up because I’m not very flexible. It feels like it’s more geared towards people who are already in shape. And some of this beginners stuff is just crazy. Maybe you could tone down the beginners exercises so beginners can actually do them and put some time between the exercises so we can get into position instead of just going right into the next one every time, just like 5 second or so would be great.","Great idea, bad design"
1,2023-02-10 23:41:44,"I signed up for three months. Admittedly swayed by the constant Instagram reels that showed some very interesting challenging workouts. I filled out a profile, and despite the fact that I am a very athletic person for my age, and very experienced, there was no adjustment for that.  I believe my 90-year-old mother could do these exercises. the icon for my age group is absolutely insulting in this day and age.  The 28 day wall, Pilates was nothing more than stretching. There was no progression no real change and the same thing over and over for 28 days then it stops there is not a new one. You can keep doing it over if you like.  Why not show some of the advanced Pilates that she shows on Instagram constantly or is that just to show her self off ???  The content articles I thought were cery helpful in the beginning about habits and changing behavior, but then it just stopped. There was no new information every day as promised.  Perhaps if I had said that I was 20 years old, I would have gotten something else but honestly not worth . Do not waste your money.",Under delivers big time
2,2023-04-13 09:50:38,"I bought this App for the 3-month special trial price at the beginning of the year. It was motivating for the first 2 weeks of my weight-loss journey, but I found that when I didn’t do the wall Pilates for the day (I was also going to gym classes) that it just stayed on that exercise until I did it. It also did not give me any motivating information unless I did the exercises! I stopped using the app but- without warning -the monthly full price subscription was deducted from my credit card. No warning that it was coming due to allow me to make a choice about renewal (which I would not have done for reasons above). Because I had purchased the app via the berrera me website and NOT the Apple Store, I found it very difficult to cancel my subscription. I contacted customer service right away when my credit card was used to request (demand) repayment since I had no prior warning, but never heard a thing from them. Don’t bother with this app!",Non-existent customer service and no renewal warning
3,2021-05-04 17:53:42,"So far I am enjoying the app a lot. The workouts are just my speed and the interactions are fairly easy to keep up with. I also love the reminders and accountability provided via the notifications. The areas I think need improvement: Food tracker: Everything is measured in ounces. I do not plan on weighing my food. Having the option to adjust the serving size makes it compatible for all types of lifestyles. I currently don’t use that feature because it just doesn’t work for what I’m doing. Fast tracker: I love this option and the reminders to start or end your fast. My complaint is I cannot adjust the times of my fast. If I forget to stop the tracker, I cannot edit the end time. If I forget, then the tracker is completely off until I decide to start it again. Some days are busier than others so being able to edit would be nice.  Demonstration videos: The videos are extremely helpful as several of the workouts are new to me. The issue is the voice and the video don’t always match. The video will show arms down to the side, but the voice will say, arms bent at a 90 degree angle. Which is accurate? It’s a small issue, but when aiming for safety and effectiveness, it matters.  I do wish I would have used the free version a little longer before purchasing a subscription because I think other individual apps could give me exactly what I want at a lower annual cost.","I like it, but..."
2,2020-08-24 18:43:54,"I’m torn between at 2 or 3 star rating. I purchased 3 months worth of this app and would not recommend paying for it. The first week I used the app I liked it a lot but as I realized some of my expectations of myself did not fit with what I was actually capable of doing I found I was not able to adjust my plan. I could edit my profile but my plan stayed the same and this discouraged my desire to continue using the app and keeping up with streaks.  I also found it frustrating that i paid to use the app and then also was expected to pay to participate in challenges.  I loved the menu and diversity of meals suggested but the pictures don’t match the recipe and the recipes are so basic that they were hard to figure out exact how to cook something. Also, once again, I was unable to change the way it had set up my plan so that it fit what I actually needed. I also was unable to save or find meals that I had made and wanted to make a second time. I like the idea of the app but it definitely needs some work.",The more I use it the less I like it

There was an add for the meal plan onetime purchase for $9.99, I jumped on the offer and was excited to try the meals. Unfortunately I got sick and wasn’t able to try due to restrictions. But that’s not my issue. A week later I was charged (pending)another $9.99 and my statement said it was a subscription. At that point I wrote customer support to cancel my subscription. I wrote reviews and even tried through the app with no response. An automatic email was always sent saying someone would contact me within 8 hours. Then a week later I was charged again. At this point several reviews were written, multiple emails sent, apple support was contacted and nothing!! Apple support said that the purchase was not through apple but the company directly even though I made it through the app. I’m highly upset that this company has stolen my money, will not cancel the subscription I didn’t want, refuses to respond and it doesn’t look like I will be getting a refund.

I am seriously impressed with it. Not only does it help your body but it helps your mind as well. There are a huge number of different types of workouts. They include everything from face yoga, yoga, walking, stretching, dancing, tai chi, Pilates and so much more. There are even workouts that you can do sitting at a desk. I am already feeling a difference in my body and mindset. You can use it to track all different things about your body and food habits as well. It also includes a delicious meal suggestion section that is customized to the type of eating that you prefer. I intentionally didn’t say diet because it’s really about eating healthy. I highly recommend this app.",The perfect app!!!
1,2019-06-13 16:49:07,"So I’m having some issues with my app. I’m not sure if other people are experiencing the same thing but for me it won’t give me the workouts for the next days? My first day was fine, when I clicked “start workout” it would pop up asking me to buy a trial, which I would click the X button to close it, and the workout would start and mark it as completed. Then it asked me to schedule my workout for tomorrow which I did. The next day I was ready to work out and when I clicked “start workout” the pop up came up again. I clicked the X but this time the workout didn’t start. It just went back. I did it numerous times again and still nothing in all the workout sections. It was fine though because I just viewed the workout and did it like that. However doing this doesn’t count as “completing” the workout. Now it’s day 3 and I can’t move to a new workout since the app thinks I didn’t complete day 2. This is very frustrating to me and I can’t seem to find out why this is happening. I’m hoping me writing this review will get my question answered but I don’t know if it will.",Won’t show my workouts
5,2020-12-01 02:56:45,"The exercises are challenging and effective. The reminders and motivation are really helpful too. I do struggle with some of the meal plans as they do not seem to coordinate well into a shopping list. I will see something like rye bread for a meal (2 slices used) and then won’t see it again for weeks. To me that means buy a loaf, eat two slices, and then hope someone else eats it or let it go to waste. The logic there is a struggle for me. Fortunately I have obtained good results even when I sub a few things in to make the meal plans a little more economical. This app is best at just giving you a plan and not over complicating it. I always got stuck in paralysis by analysis from too many years of physiology and nutrition instruction with too little practical application experience. It is nice to have good foundational principles mixed with the simplicity of just doing what works.",Great content Lots of options
1,2020-12-05 05:23:29,"I was not impressed with the app at all. I personally did not like that everything you do on the app requires additional purchases despite purchasing a subscription to the app in the first place. I paid almost $35 for the services upon my download of the app.   With that said, I chose to rate this app poorly due to their horrible customer service. After purchasing, I immediately realized the issues described in first paragraph. I emailed their customer service (Same day of purchase) through the cancel chat portion of the app with what I believe was within the cancellation policy I agreed to.  I got a response saying sorry and asking what I did not like. Ok fine. I responded with a polite explanation and again asked for refund. They just stopped responding to the messages after that despite another request for an update.  I wound up just disputing through my credit card and I was refunded.   I rarely rate apps because some people may love it while others don’t. But horrible customer service is something to be aware of if you’re paying these types of recurring charges for an app.",Bad Customer Service
5,2023-08-09 02:59:10,This app is great! Especially making you feel better about yourself knowing your headed in the right direction on getting fit and healthy! Only issue is if you are just starting out and do not know how to do the workout then this is great but if it’s like mine some will load and some won’t then my music and the person explaining cuts out and your are left stranded on how to do the workout it is supposed to show you! And when you go to the how to option nothing loads there either! I end up stopping for a quick second googling the workout it says and then play the timer on the app so I do the correct amount. Other than that one issue I love the app and will continue to use it even if I have hiccups like I’m having!,Love the workouts but app freezes and doesn’t show workout!
1,2023-05-15 23:54:39,"UPDATE:  Per the Developer’s Response below, I have emails both from Sophie and Zoe I can provide, both assuring me my subscription has been canceled, and neither of them include any 7-digit number!  I have previously received at least one other similar email from a different “Billing Specialist” stating the same, also with no 7-digit number included. I don’t expect a refund, but I am keeping the emails to provide to the bank when I dispute any future charges that may come through.    Doesn’t sync between devices, says to cancel subscription thru Apple so I did long before the auto-renew deadline, but they charged me to renew anyway. The app now opens on a “limited time offer” to pay more for something and there is no way to get out of that screen and into the app workouts or my profile.

3,2020-02-28 05:38:17,"I got this app because I needed something that had a bit of everything. I’ve tried food tracking apps and I have the Fitbit app, but it’s hard to find workouts on either. This app has great workouts for newbies, like me, and I’m sure higher levels. So far I have been just the right amount of challenged by the workouts. HOWEVER, the food tracking on this app is absolutely awful. I don’t tend to be on my phone throughout the day to log what i eat so I log everything at night and god forbid if I’m a minute past midnight, everything logs for the next day and you can’t go back and log for the previous day. Also, there is not many brands on here as far as food choices go, I mean they didn’t even have Starbucks anything. Very frustrating to keep accurate logs when you just have to click random a foods and drinks that only half match what you actually consumed. It’s not quite worth what I paid because of this, but I’m hoping it will improve.","Good, but needs work"

It feels like less of a commitment but I’m still getting in 30+ min of exercise a day, just in increments! Most workouts require 0 equipment 🙌.  I also love how they have really thought about equity and accessibility, there is a workout for EVERYONE here.

2,2020-05-27 19:39:12,"This app would be excellent if it was executed a bit better. I paid $20 for a year membership and would not pay a penny more. I feel bad for those who have paid $120. The calorie counter is not at all user friendly. Half the foods I search for are not there. I can’t log that I’ve eaten one hard boiled egg, I have to log the exact grams or ounces of egg I’ve eaten. Honestly, that’s way to much work for a full day of meals. I wish that when adding in calories you could add the macros from that item as well. The workouts are good, but there is no timer or beeping so that you know when to switch to the next workout. It’s annoying to constantly look over at my phone so that I know when to switch exercises. It’d be nice if there were like 5 seconds between exercises to change positions. That way I’m not wasting time going from a squat to laying down for sit ups.   You also can’t restart the timer for a set once it’s started. There are lots of little things about this app that just make it not worth it to me.",Great idea

Most of my meals have both of these, i went to the messaging app and wanted to ask how can I filter my meals to where fish and nuts don’t come into it? Instead there were prompted questions that only told me to substitute allergens. I’m not sure of alot of substitutes for fish and nuts which left me with more questions.

Second I wanted to install app on my other tablet and realized it didn’t save my password in my password file. No response. Recently they updated the app and now I am locked out.

After I paid I got a bit nervous because I read the most recent reviews afterwards, and see many 1* reviews saying the following things. After diving into the app myself, I noticed that those 1* reviews are just a matter of not reading the terms and navigating your own profile because if you go to your own profile in the app, you can: 1- you can change the “units” from grand to pounds 2- make your workouts harder than what it auto-set up as 3- yes you have to UNsubscribe “in” the app in your profile but it states that before signing up and when you unsubscribe it asks “Are you sure because you will loss all of your profile information if you unsubscribe now”  What I LOVE the most, on day 1, is the phenomenal content on Day 1 audio which is about being able to successfully do this is all in your MIND. The content they talk about is so true and I know it’s hard for a lot of people to understand this but it is really good content, and true, so if you follow it, it will work for you!

Although I’m not sure if it’s tracking when I’m driving as well. I don’t know if it knows when you’re going too fast and that you’re not walking, but if it doesn’t I wish you could turn off the tracker temporarily or be able to edit the number. But besides that this app is great.  Edit: Like I said this app is great but then apparently I’ve been using premium features I guess?

I reached out trying to resolve this issue and get a refund but never got a response, even after emailing them again multiple times throughout the month. After a month they then charged me another $100 (!!!!!) for this so called “coaching.” I never used the coaching because I never signed up for it, but from what I gather you are just texting an automated person that will give you basic information about nutrition or something that you could easily find by spending 5 minutes on google.

It put a lock on viewing my meals for the week and there is no option to decline the offer it just stays there every day. Now I can’t meal prep because that offer won’t go away and it will only show my meals for that day. Also I don’t like how when I heart a meal you won’t find it saved anywhere so you can make it. Also if you make a meal with the options that it has for you, it says log meal. If you click on that it does absolutely nothing, you still have to log your meal.

Initially, on Day 1, everything seemed to work fine, but as soon as Day 2 arrived, the app started freezing and showing error messages repeatedly. This issue has persisted despite my attempts to resolve it by deleting and reinstalling the app. However, each time I reinstall it, I find myself back at Day 1, unable to access any content beyond that point. It's frustrating to have paid $28 for a month long subscription only to encounter such persistent issues. Furthermore, the app's return policy requires users to prove that they have followed the plan in order to be eligible for a refund. However, how can I provide proof when the app itself doesn't even open? It feels unfair to be held responsible for an app that fails to deliver on its promises. I had high expectations for this app, but it has left me disappointed and questioning its overall quality.",Consistent error and freezing

I’ve asked for a refund however they have been nonresponsive I did follow through with everything I needed to do within the program. Because I truly truly believed in the app. However, fasting requires a little bit more information. I should’ve done my research, so yes, that is my fault. However, now they are not standing up to their promise of refunding you if things did not work. I hate leaving negative reviews because in reality you don’t know who’s telling the truth or not.

I am distracted by the looping jumps in the videos (not sure why they couldn’t video for the whole 30 secs). 2. The overlaid music tempo does not match the movements.( I want to feel motivated by the music and able to match the model’s pace.) 3. Some of the directions do not match the movements being shown. (“Move your arms as if jogging”, but the model’s arms are still.) 4. The model is facing the camera, but they do not mirror the verbal instructions. (So when she goes left it’s to your right.) 4. The video directions leave out any tips for how to remain safe, or have proper alignment. I fear someone is going to get injured. (You may find some in the written directions, but they are not thorough, nor always correct, from what I’ve learned elsewhere.) 4.

3,2018-08-19 18:01:34,"Let me start off by saying I do really enjoy this app, I like that it has reminders for work outs, an animated person to show you how to do them and it tells you the reps and counts down for you. I’ve noticed that the recipes circulate within a week, I have seen the same recipes almost 4 times now for each meal.  I’m also curious that after you finish the 28 day challenge with select workouts, do they then recycle and you get a new work out to complete? If so that’s fantastic, if not then this app really needs work. If people are paying $10 a month for it and it doesn’t give you new work outs, what’s the point?   I would hate to see this app go under because I really enjoy it, but it definitely needs to be more user friendly and equipped with more options. So please app people! Give more workouts after the 28 day period ( if you don’t already) and please give different recipes!",Needs more options for the price.

They suggest I pay again and will instead prolong the week period to a month, I don’t want to pay more when I can just cancel before the week is up. I understand busy schedules yet they don’t reply and avoid my question and not really answer to what I want (which is to cancel indefinitely)...I did this purchase on the website but to no avail they still haven’t replied. I hope they have an option to cancel a subscription in the future instead of communicating through messaging and emails because it’s unnecessary amount of steps to do.

Life does happen and I was pretty disappointed to find out if you miss a work out, you are just out of luck. I paid for it but didn’t even get to compete the program. I am not somebody who works out every day. I try to a couple times a week but I have a demanding job, sometimes have low energy and other things going on in my life. I like to do things at my own pace and didn’t even get through 2 weeks. I got to the end of the 28 days and they told me my subscription ended and that was that. I will not ever pay for this again.

1,2021-01-31 08:38:49,"These have got to be reviews from people who were paid or compensated somehow because there’s just no way this app has any positive ratings at all. Well, I do like the idea. It has potential. But is so flawed I cannot believe they are letting it run like that. Their food tracker doesn’t have simple common foods listed. The portions/serving amount in their food tracker can only be measured by ounces. So even if you had 1/3 teaspoon of something you couldn’t properly log it. The WATER tracker & the STEP tracker not only do not reset every new day, but they also tend to glitch and reset in the middle of your day. All of a sudden, your 24 oz of water drank has been set to 0.  It’s very discouraging. The WORKOUT also doesn’t change. I’ve had the same recommended workout for a week now. Every time I have contacted their customer support they don’t respond. There’s literally no one to help you.

It's not easy to log foods: there is only 2 types of measurements instead of a variety that you can choose (it's either grams or ounces). The recipes looked good but many of them are not complete. They list ingredients but some listed ingredients don't appear in the description of how to make the meal, so you are left wondering (""example: where do you use the garlic?"") You can cancel your membership and told you still have access, but they log you out and then neither your email nor your password works to log back in. When you try to reset your password, you receive an email that your email is not recognized. Thus, you can't log back in and customer service doesn't respond to your request for help.

It does have some great features, enough for me to keep my subscription for now.  I really like the intermittent fasting feature and having meals to choose from is a plus.  I also like that you can choose from so many diet plan variations.  Another feature you should consider adding is the ability to upload your shopping list to insta cart or for grocery pickup.  Just some suggestions because I live by convenience. I don’t have time to go through recipes and write them down. Technology is advanced enough to add these features. Hopefully these changes will come in the future.",I like it so far
1,2020-10-15 09:49:29,"The purchase during the $1 trial was confusing. I was prompted to add exclusive upgrades and did not realize it’s not part of their trial. Within minutes of setting up and checking out this app, I decided to cancel subscription. I was already charged for the trial plus the upgrade and I went thru Apple to cancel but purchase was made against my default PayPal and account was already billed. I requested refund since I had not used their product for a day and now told that no subscription will be charged and I would continue to have access until it expired. I have requested PayPal to help with my refund request.   I did not like the confusing trial signup - that process had these pop up offers which were additional charges. I did not like that the nutrition option didn’t allow a way to change choices. It seemed every feature you had to unlock or upgrade. My dashboard had locks on it and multiple prompts to add options were available for more money.  I can get access to similar apps where i do not have to pay for all these extras and therefore I didn’t see any particular value to switching to this one.    Be careful if you sign up for this app without even getting a chance to see it until after you are already billed and then get a link to download and install. Look at the past reviews.

2,2019-09-16 05:31:25,"I purchased the yr subscription and realized it may have been a bad decision. The workouts are ok but the menu options are a little off. Today I had 1 recipe w/ no bake temp, 1 recipe that needed olives but said nothing about the olives in the instructions, 1 recipe used Celsius (which was easy to google the right temp in F) and so on. Also, I’m unable to make certain preferences. They have the major food issues but nothing for ppl who don’t eat specific foods. (Ex: Buckwheat, chia, squash, zucchini) Sadly I don’t like those things and more but I’m unable to remove them from my meal lists. Also, today the app said my meals were to help burn belly fat. However, if I decide to change a meal, which I’m going to do, I’m unsure if I’m changing it to the same type of “belly fat burning” meal or just some random meal. I want to make sure I lose the weight properly but if your menus are flawed then I will need to look elsewhere for a meal plan.   Also, when I first signed up I placed the incorrect start weight and now I can’t change it.   Last but not least, I know for a fact I don’t walk 2,420 steps a day but somehow the app continues to log steps. I feel like it logs when I drive but I’m not entirely sure.   If I were looking to purchase this app, I would try a monthly plan to make sure it’s right instead of the yearly. You might find this is for you, you might find it’s not. Either way, good luck on your weight loss journey 🤗",Ehhh
2,2023-07-11 17:16:28,"Eh, it would be helpful if it were more tailored to the individual instead of lumping everyone into the same program. For instance, I don’t need help with my nutrition and I personally don’t have issues around food. I let myself indulge on occasion and I don’t dwell on it. I return to my usual healthy eating patterns. When asked in onboarding if I needed nutritional advice or wanted help with it I checked no. First thing on the reading portion was about mindset. Asked questions about how I react to food after a stressful day and honestly I didn’t fit anywhere into the answers given, but in order to move forward I had to pick one. There is no one size fits all method, and after answering the initial assessment questions, I quite frankly didn’t feel listened to when my plan came up. Something to think about when updating your program, perhaps. Not feeling heard is big No for me when it comes to a health plan.",Needs some improvement

Today I started the first day of my free 7 day trial and honesty I’m very happy to say that I really like this app!   I gave this app 5 stars because it not only shows you how to do the exercises but it lets you go on your own pace unlike workout videos  ! Here are a couple if things that i noticed I really liked!    It gives you the rep number and while trying to figure out how to do the exercise, you are not being rushed. There is an animated person (you) doing the exercise with you and showing you how its done.   Another thing i like about the app is that, it gives you recipes (that may seem weird) but they’re just suggestions that can seem to be really helpful especially for someone who doesn't know exactly how to eat healthy !   Lastly, i like that the app wants you to be comfortable with your body! The exercises you choose would be based on what you want to work out!   Overall, the app is a great starting app for someone who works and doesn’t have time for the gym or simply cannot afford a trainer!

At first, everything seems to work great, great motivational articles, user friendly calorie trackers, vast selection of workout options. Until day 15, I opened the app and realized all my previous logs were gone! I closed the app and reopened, and made sure I was signed in, still there was nothing… I double checked my online account, it showed my previous two week workout time records, but nothing else… I reported the issue, a week has passed, no one even got back to me.  In the meantime, I didn’t want to loose the exercise momentum, so I started from day 1 again, but adding a few other routines through the app’s large pool of workout sessions. However, today I realized, after a long sweaty full cardio session, that the app did not log my workout minutes… (yes I was following the session found in the app). I went ahead and tried to manually log them in, the app would not let me (tried countless times)  I personally value the tracking feature in a workout app more than anything else.

That was the main reason I wanted to purchase a subscription.   The offered a calorie tracker where I could enter in my calories for the day. A lot of the things I would eat were not on their food list, and the nutritional facts were wrong compared to the labels on my food. That’s fine, I could manually input my calories, but there’s I cannot manually input anything else so there’s no way I can track carbs or fats, things that are also important to me.   The only thing I genuinely enjoyed way the workout routines they offered. This is great to help you get started with exercising but this is a terrible meal based diet app. I regret purchasing a subscription and almost feel lied to :/.   I feel like this could easily have won me over (even if it wasn’t meeting my expectations) by:  - a list of different meal choices instead of one set for the day (that you may not like), and the nutrition facts of the meal - the ability to manually track other things besides for only calories.","Great idea, poorly executed."

Also actually following those recipes would be extremely time consuming like 3+ hours out of your day and extremely expensive. The workouts are either too easy or too hard. I can’t do any of the toned arms and breast workouts because I barely have any muscle in my arm. I am supposed to do a one handed push up on the second day...how??

What bothers me most is that the items list is super chaotic. If you cannot find the food to log, you can save a new title (which sounds great), but i guess the app makes each user title public, so there are dozens of “avocado”s to pick up.

The scanner doesn’t pick up many of the foods I scan. And when it does, they’re always measured in OUNCES (not servings or grams or anything else) and there’s no other unit of measure you can select. If I scan a piece of bread it automatically calculates it as 3.63 ounces. But, when compared to the fat/calories of 1 piece, it doesn’t even match up to the nutritional info on the package. Useless information!! Changing the preferred measurement in your “Profile” section does not change that (contrary to the responses I read from the developer on other reviews). If I can’t properly track what I’m eating then no amount of exercise/diet is going to work if you can’t track it all as a whole. I’ve written to Support twice with no response. Wasted $30 on this app! BS!",Not Happy
1,2023-08-26 23:32:42,Honestly I don’t see the appeal of this app. The workouts are not very good. I thought i was paying for an actual personal trainer and their pre-recorded videos. However they look animated and some of the movements they have you do are not realistic. The calorie tracking and other stuff is ok but I’ve seen better in other apps. I reached out to customer service and they where not very helpful. I used the app twice and immediately reached out to them that I wanted a refund and wasn’t going to use the app. They said they could give me pale tail refund but honestly what’s the point. You have an unhappy costumer that would like their money back and didn’t even use the app for 3 days and expect the pay for half of the service that they don’t even want? Please make that make since. Do better “BetterMe”. If y’all for people than give me a full refund. But obviously you’re not. Don’t download the app. Don’t waste your money.,Disappointed
1,2020-05-18 19:57:20,Paid $30 apparently for a free trial. The app said I wouldn’t be charged and all of a sudden a 30$ charge for 6 months was on my account and I had to cancel for a subscription that was going to renew in 6 months. Okay fine but then I find out the meal plan isn’t even included and is an extra 30$ when trying to see food tips. Already paid 30$ for an app and I can’t even use all its functions or even choose my workout plan. It gives me an automatic one based on my weight and habits but if you want to do other workouts they won’t be added to your plan. It shows in your plan that you haven’t even done your workout which is unsatisfying when you have finished a workout. You have to remember which challenge you were doing. The workouts are cool but I wish there was an audio option so you can tell when a stretch or set is done. You don’t always stare at the screen when you are trying to workout. Hopefully you guys can improve these areas,Over priced
3,2023-10-21 14:03:32,"The videos are good, the meal ideas and recipes are good but I hope you don’t need any help with the app, you will NEVER receive any contact. You send a message requesting any kind of support (I did it for the same issue 3 times) and you receive an email that the question has been received, that is as far as your question goes. All 3 messages I sent were for the same question since none of them merited a response apparently. Ultimately I found Great Wall Pilates videos on you tube for free and recipes can be googled for free as well so I cancelled my subscription. Again this is not a free service so they should try to have some sort of customer support. Funny enough after I cancelled I kept getting emails enticing me to return yet still waiting on a response from my initial inquiries.",Nonexistent customer support
1,2020-08-31 16:56:04,This app is ridiculous. You’re promised to only be charged one time. But then in a month they’re expecting more money. Way too many issues to actually pay for this app. The workouts could be great if voice instruction could be heard. It’s also impossible to select from menu items that you consumed in the past at the same amount of calories to add to your daily intake. They make you re-calculate on your own and re-enter each and every time you eat the exact same thing. Why can’t the salad that I eat every single night have the exact same amount of calories in it when I’m adding the exact same ingredients.  There is a step counter. That’s super awesome. But your phone has to actually be on your person in order for the steps to be counted. Why can’t I have a separate pedometer and enter the steps in myself? For an app that thinks that it’s good enough to automatically charge you weekly there is absolutely NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT!! No one ever gets back to you!,Could Be Good
1,2020-08-16 14:54:23,"Okay, so before I really enjoyed better me. The workout plan was organized and you could pick when intensity you wanted, and then what part of your body you wanted to work on. Then, you were given a workout plan to do and it would tell you what you workout to do every day. I really liked this. But they just updated it. So now, instead of organized, it just has a list of things, like Yoga, Tabata, Fitness at Home, etc, and shows how many workouts are in that section. They don’t give you a plan anymore!  Now their just like:”Pick a workout out of the 81 WORKOUTS we provided in the “Workout at Home” section.” Its not good anymore! It’s sloppy and confusing. There’s no schedule and it’s really lazy. It was really good until this update! Now, there’s no intensity levels, so I’m either not getting challenged enough or getting challenged too much at a really high intensity level. BetterMe, PLEASE CHANGE BACK. I really liked the plans and seeing what workout I had to do every day.",It was good...
1,2023-07-19 17:43:50,"In January, I did the trial that was offer before purchasing. I canceled before the trial was up, because I found it difficult to incorporate the workout into my day. A few months later, I downloaded the app again and purchased my subscription. I downloaded it on both my phone and iPad. The app seems to work fine on the phone, but it doesn’t seem to synch on my iPad. I have tried several time to get things in order with the iPad with no success. Whenever I go to the website, it states that I do not have an active account when I clearly do. I have reached out to customer service several times via email to no avail. I want to like the app and continue with my fitness journey using Better Me, but if I cannot access anything through the site or my iPad, I may cancel my subscription. It had been MONTHS of me reaching out to their customer service and I still have yet to get a response.",POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
5,2020-12-21 04:42:30,"The app got me because I was interested in intermittent fasting and which option out there would be beat for you...not really what this is app is about. Basic info I could figure for myself nothing in-depth or knowledge based behind it , just pick an option and they set a timer...it’s a joke! Plus I was charged $4.99 twice and when I asked for a refund after a few day I was told I signed up for an additional program which I did not. I’ve been messaging to try to get a redound, based on principle that this isn’t & doesn’t do what it calms to...it’s been a few weeks of back and forth with a partial resolution. Save your money there’s better apps out there with better customer service!",Not worth the money...poor execution
1,2021-01-07 22:24:03,The AP is skillful at getting you to sign up while you believe you are only signing in. The next thing you know if you check your payment method there are multiple weekly charges for item you were only looking at to see what/ how they were. Next think you know you have a active subscription you can’t cancel and no way to communicate with the charging company which is based out in the Ukrane- most likely because they can operate beneath any laws requiring them to refund your money. The only help given to cancel is to go into the subscription on your device and select cancel subscription- the. It shows it is still active and can be activated on multiple other levels which will begin charging you weekly without your knowledge.   Very sneaky and hard to back out of. If your not sure you want to just blindly use the AP dont download it! It is t worth the risk/ cost.,Light your money on fire to feel a burn - Would give this a -5 stars if possible!
5,2020-02-23 07:46:31,"I’m not sure who to contact, but I recently accidentally purchased a subscription with you guys with out purposely meaning to buy it, I mean I’m a 17 year old male, and I’d really be so thankful if you guys could help me by refunding my money, I didn’t have the subscription for more than a few minutes until I realized what I had done, and instantly cancelled it, and I really don’t want to virtually spend 30 dollars for opening the app to realize what I’d done, I’m so sorry if this is any inconvenience, but I really don’t know what to do, I’m so worried I won’t be able to receive my money back, I had no intention, of actually purchasing the subscription then it was too late, I feel like an idiot, so could you please help me find a way to get my money back",I’m dumb
5,2021-04-18 07:51:34,"I am an army veteran and I’ve been struggling with losing weight since I’ve gotten out of service. During the pandemic I gained a lot of weight and I was currently waiting in at 364lbs and this year I weighed at 342lbs. I know I needed to make a change with my nutrition as well as with my workouts. When I started I was 338 and two weeks later I am now 324lbs and counting down! With the expert tips and the exercises and meal plans that come along with this app I am definitely recommending this app to anyone in need of a change. It’s easy to use very simple to understand and very convenient to follow, my target goal weight is 200lbs. And I see no problem with achieving this goal now that I have Better Me.",Great Investment
2,2020-01-28 22:17:53,"I’m still in my first week of using this app and I like everything except for logging your food. IT IS TERRIBLE! It doesn’t let you “plan” the meals you want to eat ahead of time. Yeah, you can see a selection of meals and change it and add to your log when the day comes, but why not have the app available to plan the week ahead. People like to prep ahead of time to save time and money. It would also be much easier to use a barcode scanner so I can ACCURATELY report my calories,etc. I would even try typing the exact brand/labeling on the bag and it still doesn’t give me the correct option to choose from. If I can combine the Lifesum app with this app, it would be unstoppable. Needs more attention to the food log portion of the app. I kind of wish I would have tried the free trial instead of subscribing. I think that’s where it gets you too (you’ll understand if you decide to download the app).",Not sure yet!
3,2023-10-24 17:45:42,"I got the 28 day workout plan. I was looking for quick and simple instructional workouts to help boost weight loss and release stored emotions. I’m still on the first week. I have some complaints. The verbal instructions are somewhat difficult to understand and don’t always line up with the visual aid. The videos are about 11 minutes - I do like that they are short and sweet. Especially when I am feeling calm and connected by the 10th minute. Then every video ends with a celebratory “you did it” sound. It’s a stark contrast from the soft background yoga music to basically an alarm going off telling me I’m done. My mental calmness achieved during the workout is undone as it finishes.  Doesn’t appear to be an option to turn that off. While a good idea, I wouldn’t continue paying for this service.",Have complaints

I love the workouts. The app allows you to choose the type of workout you want to do. I chose dance, walking and basic exercise. The dance workout videos are great.I’m not a great dancer so it takes me a few times to watch the video.  The different basic exercises include back,  core and abdominal strengthening. All have been easy to follow.  There are only 9 chapters to read. Can’t wait for them to add more, but the 9 have been really helpful.  There’s a place to track water, food intake and so much more.",Love this app
1,2020-06-15 21:43:46,"Even downloading the app you will be charged. My friend and I signed up together. We all received the exact same generic emails that they send to everyone. They say it’s base off of your body type and what you’d like to accomplish. No matter what we sent them, they said the same thing back to all of us. Better to pay the money on an actual trainer who will make sure you are seeing the results you want and tailor the workouts to you. This is a money hog app. They claim it’s all apple who’s doing the charges but really it’s them receiving the money and not wanting to take the blame. Instead they blame everything on everyone else. It’s their app. Not apples app. They ask for the charges to happen not apple. The need to take responsibility for their part and stop blaming everyone else. I was charge $193 one day and another $45 the next, kind you I hadn’t even opened the app except when I first heard about it. Huge SCAM.

I consider myself a pretty athletic, fit person and thought the app may help me change my workout routine. After the two days I cancelled my “free trial”. Days later, I noticed that I was getting charged 10 dollars every month. I couldn’t figure out what was charging me and after talking to my bank I was advised to get a new card which I did and the charges stopped. I truly believed that someone had gotten my card Information! Then I put my new card’s info on my iTunes account and the monthly charges started again.  It wasn’t until after I spoke to iTunes customer service that I found out I was paying for an app I didn’t even have on my phone anymore. I’m honestly very upset and would like to get my money back!! I’ve been charged over 40 dollars.",They kept charging me after I cancelled my free trial beware!!
1,2023-10-14 10:35:15,"Just don’t buy it.  You don’t get your money back with these apps or any app for that matter; so don’t.  There isn’t a trial period so you don’t find out the quirks and inadequacies before paying your money. I chose Somatic exercises and was surprised to notice the robot.  It’s hilarious, actually, once yr  pass the frustration for having fell for the marketing of the app.  A robot-saves money, I guess.  It’s not user friendly in adding food sources. It’s not intuitive.  No scanner for bar codes. You can’t adjust the amounts in there, except adding numbers like 1, 2, 3….. not a lot of choices for finding food.  I have to check to see if there are actual instructions, but I will use it going forward for the teaching.  Their lessons are exceptional. I like how they break down why one doesn’t succeed with making changes…the irrational.  Why we do or don’t do what we really want to do. That’s what I like.  👍🏽",Just DON’T Buy it
1,2023-07-29 19:10:26,I have been using this app since March to track my calories along with fat/carbs/protein and to track my fasting. I just went into the app to check how many hours I am at in my current fast I started and logged in the app last night. Everything is gone! It is forcing me to create an account. I don’t know if I had created one with an email back in March or not. When I try to ask for assistance with a forgotten password it emails me saying I don’t have an account with that email address. I have exactly 2 gmail email accounts. One for things like this and one for important stuff that I actually want emails about. It doesn’t recognize either email for a password reset. So all my history is gone. It you are going to update an app and force setting up email logins you need to include a way for those already using the app to keep their information.,Yesterday’s update wiped out my entire history
1,2020-10-15 08:19:08,"I was using the 9.99 a month version. I didn’t keep my subscription in August. I purchased a year subscription to only have a totally different version. It no longer offers the walking and running. It no longer offers the stretching challenge, the plank challenge, the leg challenge and other challenges I enjoyed. I see now they charge extra for these things. Why even charge to use the app if I will have to pay to do challenges as well. Under fitness There are only 6 different types of plans. They no longer separated easy, moderate, and hard workout from each other. I was so disappointed and feel as if I have wasted my money purchasing a full year’s subscription.  I use to love this app but not so much anymore. Also what is the difference between the premium version and the non premium?  One more thing their should be a voice or a ding to let you know when it is time to change excises.",This app has changed since the summer
2,2020-09-15 20:41:56,"There are nice features in this app from the targeted fitness, reminders for water intake, timers for fasting, and calorie tracking. Water intake, steps, weight tracking are all available in the health app so nice it’s in one space but not novel.   The exercises aren’t daunting or coming with mega changes to the schedule to be a turn off.   However, I initially got the app for the meal planning and recipe suggestions. It was (WAS) good, if not great, with a list of all items in the recipes planned for the week, low cal yummy choices picked from a list so I could avoid foods I don’t eat and the ability to switch options at meal time (if day you planned to eat soup but would rather have chicken.).   BUT the developer decided the variety, options, shopping lists and substitutions were not necessary anymore. I feel like I’m in a box and have no purpose for the app. In trying to change habits and for the two weeks I had the “old” app with the flexible meal plan, I was making progress but the new plan keeps offering fish- which I don’t eat with no options so I’m now standing in front of the fridge trying to decide what to make. There are no longer options, substitutions, or planning tools.

But What is ticking me off though is that I recently got a new phone and I can’t seem to restore purchases and now I feel robbed. And as one of the comments read… “it discourages you from all the effort you’ve done so far” and they ain’t wrong!  I agree. I feel like giving up since I haven’t had one response from the many emails I’ve reached out to on “customer support”. And that’s a bummer.

3,2018-05-03 06:07:23,"This app is a complete disappointment for the price. Along with providing very minimal information on proper dieting, meal ideas, exercises etc. as well as being slow, buggy & glitchy they processed an unauthorized $50 payment for a 6month subscription after I had recalled canceling any subscriptions I had, and deleting the app off my phone weeks ago. I am trying to receive a refund right now but am having no luck, therefore am EXTREMELY dissatisfied and disappointed in both those who run this app and Apple support.  Just to update I did manage to get my money back, but was still dissatisfied with the fact that I never signed up for a 6 month membership in the first place and the subscription for this app is definitely overpriced as you can find most of the information it offers online for free.","Very, very disappointed."

At that point, I was charged immediately, and the free trial ended. I still had three or four days left on the trial, so buyer beware that if you purchase before your trial is over, due to one of the many offers that pop up on the screen, you can kiss the rest of the trial days goodbye. And if you decide you won’t use the app and you believe you’re still in your trial days, good luck getting a refund. I contacted customer service through the app twice and also  emailed them the information they wanted, as well as a request for follow-up help.

If it looked good, maybe I’d try it for a couple months … I decided the app wasn’t for me and planned to cancel. Of course, I forgot… and was bummed when I saw the charge a month later … but my sadness turned to shock when I was charged another $90 !!!!!!

I appealed to them for a refund - acknowledging my mistake at not cancelling I did not request the initial subscription charge refund (about $50) … but this extra $90 was clearly a mistake.   They refused to give me a full refund but did cough up 50%. Again, I have no idea how I signed up for that service so I refused their offer to extend the license for 3 months.

I can feel the muscles and I’m trilled with the wall support. I feel I am using correct technique instead of arching my back. I was going to cancel because I felt after the first workout I could just get exercises from internet however this app keeps me on track and really keeps me motivated.

I don’t like that on the tracking food does not have everything. I had to go on the internet to figure out what my calorie count was. So I just gave up to write down everything I ate and try to count the calories. This app is so discouraging me. The fasten button should automatically start over again, that’s not the case you have to stop or start and my fasting start before I get up in the morning. It’s only one measurement to count your water so if your not math savvy then you will have to research how much water you have to drink. You guys have to put different food up.

And most workouts I saw ARE FREE to use. They also give the option of meal planning but that is for the subscription price. All in all I’m happy that these developers decided to make an app that would be beneficial to its user whether they could afford to pay a monthly subscription or not. GREAT JOB!","Good for free, better when bought"
1,2023-01-04 16:46:33,"Today was a strange exercise day. The “exercises” consisted only in sitting and standing. Same thing over and over again. The only so called exercises consisted in rolling the feet around, then back to sitting still again.  If do meditation every day. I didn’t pay you to show me how to sit quiet on a chair. Not even standing up next to a chair.   So, halfway through, I skipped the rest of it and chose “I can do more”. I chose the option “working to get a six-pack.”  What happened now was that the image either was blank or that the video froze. I just saw the time ticking by. I skipped forward, but it didn’t get any better further ahead in the program.  I’m also already getting tired of the monotonous music. It seems to be the same day after day.  Another thing that I have been thinking since day 1: many times, when doing a movement, you have to look in another direction and can’t keep your eyes on the screen. But the same music goes on without interruption while one exercise goes over in the next. Why not put in some kind of sound that indicates that it’s time to stop with one exercise and start with next?  Am I going to get a comment on this? Or is the overall service as poor as the exercises seemed today? Right now, it feels as though I have waisted my money on crap.",My 5th day

I tried to put in my lunch for calories, but I guess you have to take a picture of your food before you eat it, or just pick from their suggested meals.  I won’t dock stars for the meal thing because I'm probably just too lazy to figure it out.  I had to pay for a subscription (fb ad) to check out the app, so it was a leap of faith. The ad said you got access to all the apps features for 3 mos for $30 but when I click on things it wants me to pay more.  The ad explicitly said this was not an automatic renewal situation, but when I click on the terms and conditions in the app it says it is an auto renewal unless you cancel, so that’s shady to me.  The actual workouts are pretty cool to me..lots of selection for a beginner.",Meh.

The “Join the Challenge” section of the app is working fine (of course) but MEALS and MY PLAN are not loading at all.   **UPDATE** I found the issue that was making parts of the app freeze. I logged out and logged back in and it worked fine. A few hours later, same issue, I logged out and logged back in and it worked again. Just want you guys to know that you may want to fix that bug!

Luckily I changed it to the 9.99 option for after the “free” trial because about five minutes after I looked through it I realized what crap it was and canceled my trial. I’m already being charged 9.99 (plus tax) I haven’t even had the app an hour!  I didn’t go and re-purchase the app or click any of the dozen different payment options or change anything, I CANCELLED only. I see the app developer blaming apple and this is complete b.s. Also providing a link for “Apple” to give you a “refund”, guess what,  you can’t click on a link here.  What a ripoff. Wish I would have read reviews before downloading. Also, the quality and amount of content is insulting for a paid app as it is. I would NEVER recommend this App to anyone for ANY reason.

5,2021-10-24 23:06:55,I started off at 145 lbs at 5’5 and ended off with 120 in around 4 months. Through spending 30 minutes on this app a day and calorie deficits I achieved my goal and feel more comfortable about myself. This app is mainly free and I really suggest it for beginners.  But in order to lose any type of weight you must have the right mindset. You must realize that results won’t come super fast and become motivated if you don’t your going to go back to your old bad habits. Instead of watching your show when you come back from school/work take some time to workout. Without having a “can do” mindset you won’t get far.,This app is amazing for beginners
1,2023-06-13 11:15:22,"Some of the bigger things I find frustrating: 1. The work outs are film separately and then spaced together so you need to be constantly rotating your yoga mat while the person in the videos just flips instantly. This also makes it not feel like you are doing it together  2. The music is not at all motivating or energetic. It’s really bad elevator music and makes me want to go to sleep. 3. The “custom plan” it gave me (a healthy, fit 45 year old) is for seniors and so very boring. I can pick outer workouts but I can’t find how to reset the 28 day challenge for something appropriate and it’s annoying (and a little insulting).  4. The “congratulations, you completed the workout” work out screen is a dynamic image that doesn’t let your screen go to sleep so it will drain the battery of your device if you walk away from it.   All and all, the custom workout plan was a fail, the workouts I can select are still kind of boring and don’t feel effective, the usurper interface is not very well designed and the background music is awful. If I tell the app the workout wasn’t enough it recommends I workout longer instead of recommending better workouts for the next day. I want a program where 15 minutes is all I need, this is not that.",I find this app frustrating on several levels
2,2021-02-06 07:33:08,"The App costs 9.99 USD per week and interesting add-one like meal plans or challenges cost extra. The basic (subscription) App is pretty basic, a plan for building up your daily step number. You can also log water and calories but even the free version of My Fitness Pal is more convenient for these  features and has the advantage of linking with Garmin, Fitbit, or other fitness gadgets and Apps. Great free meal plans are available from other sources. The idea of these services out of one App is good but not yet well enough realized in my opinion, especially considering the steep price tag.  I am impressed with Better Me customer service. They answered promptly to my emails and will refund the amount in line with their purchase terms. I may check back occasionally to see how the app is developing. A free 1 month trial (or even only 1 week) would be a helpful feature.",Not enough value for money
2,2020-12-31 16:51:56,"This app has some usefulness which is why I gave it a two.  The food logging is limited so it’s useful for trends but don’t expect a completely accurate calorie count.  The reminders to log your food and workout are helpful.  If you do the trial subscription you will receive several pop-ups with deals for different subscription levels.  I took one of these deals and signed up for the annual subscription.  What they don’t tell you is that you have to manually cancel the trial subscription (which doesn’t show up anywhere on your Apple subscriptions) or you will continue to be charged.  I signed up for an annual subscription and then was charged for two separate (concurrent) quarterly subscriptions.  I didn’t notice when it happened the first time but contacted customer service when the 2nd quarterly charge appeared.  They will not refund the concurrent subscription.  I am one person and have the app on one device - why do I need two subscriptions.  In the end, the “deal” I got for a $20 annual subscription ended up costing me $80.  😡  On top of that you are constantly bombarded with pop-ups for additional paid challenges.  I like the idea of challenges but not when they are popping up as ads for additional purchases every time I open the app.",Buyer Beware!
1,2019-06-07 00:08:29,I did the trial for 7 days. After that I felt like I could do better on my own. They charged me for the first week and supposedly I became a member I stopped using it and it kept charging me. So I was looking on how to end my subscription and it didn’t show that I was a member. I googled on how to end it and I couldn’t find my account. It just said that once you subscribe you will see ur account and be able to cancel. But it’s been three charges later and still nothing. So I went to my iTunes ( which is another nightmare after the upgrade!) but I finally cancelled it from there. Ugh!!!!! We’ll see what happens! There’s not even a customer service number or anything. Ur pretty much on your own! Nightmare!!!! To make matters worse you can’t delete the app and make the payments disappear. They state that even if you deleted the app you will still get charged until you cancel!!  DO NOT GET THIS!!! Ur better off on your own. Trust!,Nightmare
2,2020-06-09 12:28:52,"I needed an app to help keep me accountable and liked that this had everything in one place. I bought the 12 week plan. Unfortunately there are just so many flaws that it feels unfinished and unsatisfying.   First ... why do I have to pay again to log I drank a glass of water? Logging water should be in the base!   The fact your meal plan can’t be logged into your food diary is beyond crazy. I like the plan (although it is too difficult and costly to follow in entirety) but then I have to google all the ingredients in ozs to add to my food diary individually. I forgive u for not having an extensive list of foods but the laziness of not programming your meals in (even if I had to search them by name) is just such poor planning.   I did enjoy the exercises but I agree some audio cues would be a great enhancement. I was able to make it work though.   Tips and walking are just so so, on par with others. It’s a little laughable to have to pay $10 to enter a sugar free challenge.   In future add ability to add body measurements and track losses as well as more analytics of the data collected. I would have been tempted to upgrade to some of the other features but i won’t be spending anymore money due to disappointment with the base.

1,2021-01-01 21:10:07,"The intermittent fasting is not user friendly in that you can’t adjust time or customize it. As far as customizing goes, nit a choice for your workouts either. I used to use an app that would let me customize my workouts based on the equipment I had available (be it at home or the gym...I had different settings and could use my preset home or preset gym setting). Also, if you have an injury and are unable to do an exercise, there are no options/suggestions to replace the exercise with another one for the same muscle that might work better for you (a feature the other app had as well). Also, I have a Fitbit, so I am unable to track my steps accurately.   The other app was a bit more expensive, so I gave this one a try.

I emailed them, they responded less than 24 hours later asking for more info such as my receipt or PayPal invoice that I used to purchase. I responded with that info a few days later and never heard anything back and it’s been weeks. I requested a refund from Apple since I was never able to log back in and never got a response from customer service. I even sent a follow up email asking if there was an update. No response.

1,2023-07-31 01:31:30,"I am disappointed with the Better Me app as a motivational tool. Initially, I had a positive experience and was making good progress. However, after using the app for about a week and a half, an update was required. Unfortunately, upon updating, all my progress was deleted, forcing me to start from scratch. This setback has been particularly discouraging for me as I was trying to establish a consistent workout routine.   Losing all my progress due to the update has been demotivating and has hindered my ability to stay on track with my fitness goals. A motivational app should provide consistent support and encouragement, but the Better Me app's failure to retain my progress has had the opposite effect.   I believe it is crucial for the developers to address this issue promptly and find a solution to prevent data loss in future updates. Additionally, it would be beneficial if they could offer some form of compensation or support to users who have experienced setbacks like mine.   Overall, while the Better Me app has potential as a motivational tool, the setback caused by the update issue has significantly impacted its effectiveness. I hope the developers take the necessary steps to rectify this problem and ensure a smoother user experience in the future.",Lost my progress and motivation
1,2023-07-24 09:49:09,"App is very cheaply made, here are a few points that make the app so frustrating to use that I will not continue even though I paid for a 30 day subscription:  1. No proper warmup before exercises, perhaps because the entire workout feels like a warmup - not challenging at all  2. Voice guidance doesn’t always match to what the trainer is showing :) Clearly nobody bothered to double check such a basic thing.    3. Trainers are different in the same workout, which I personally don’t like   4. The workout consists of a ton of short clips of 30 seconds or so of different exercises complied together with different trainers and different rooms they are in, which is off putting in my opinion   5. Music and clicking is simply annoying + voice sounds robotic   6. Sometimes it takes more time to go from one position to another than the duration of the whole exercise   7. No logical timeline of exercises - some are done standing, then sitting, I would prefer to have all standing then all sitting exercises so it’s not a waste of time to keep adjusting from one to the other   The list can go on and on, in summary - everything about the app is unappealing and I won’t use it anymore, it’s neither a relaxing nor energizing experience, simply waste of time.",Would not recommend

I like how they show you (through an animation of a woman) how to do each specific exercise and show you what to focus on when you’re doing it - keep back at 45 degree angle for squats, move your foot along this line of motion for this one, etc. App is easy to use.

The shopping list is also blank and it looks like you have to manually go through all the meals and add them one by one to the shopping list which is again a pain.

Currently, you have to go into the app to start and stop your fast and that’s not always convenient. There are times I don’t have my phone with me and I have to wait until the next day to reset everything. Having that option on Apple Watch would help as well.

5,2023-07-11 19:41:57,"As far as right now, I’ve had the app for maybe a month. The only thing that I feel like it needs is I feel like it needs you give you a little bit more time in between the workouts and also may be like a preview of what you have to do before getting into the actual work out I know it has a little boxes with the explanation of what to do but I feel like when you’re doing the timing work out it should give you a small little preview and that preview gives you the time to get into the actual workout I don’t know if that makes any sense, but yeah, so far I love the app",Love it buuuuut…
1,2019-06-02 23:32:10,I am in my trial period and I have not found the app helpful at all. I have been trying to cancel and can’t. I go to subscriptions and everything just like the help page on the app instructs me to do but there is no cancel subscription button like it says. You can scroll down. All you see is a bunch of different plan options but no place to cancel. Ugh!!  I don’t recommend something that traps people.  UPDATE: STILL can’t cancel. After trying to go to the chat feature as instructed I find out the chat feature does NOT work!!  I’ve been charged at least twice now and I’m sooo frustrated!  I just want to cancel! And on top of it they told me to go to the chat feature and yet they knew it didn’t work. “Mary” the supposed personal trainer sent me a welcome message two weeks ago when I started this stupid trial that even said “PS: Chat is temporary unavailable.”  Seriously!?!?!,Can’t cancel!  It’s a trap!!
1,2019-05-24 21:46:29,"I like this app, but I can’t do the full 28 days workout because I have to pay. I just think that people with no subscription should at least have a few free workouts. I hate how I can’t even do Day 2. There should be like premium workouts, which are workouts people with the subscription can do. I also think not all of the meals should only be for subscription members only. Sure, the afternoon snack and the morning snack could be for subscription users. But breakfast, lunch, and dinner should be free. All I wanted was a good workout, and I’m not gonna pay 8 dollars (I think that’s the price) for an extra day. I know 8 dollars might seem cheap, but I still need my parents approval if I want to purchase something, and always they say no, which means that I can’t do the workouts. I just think that not all of the workouts should be for subscription users only and also the same with the meals.",My review
1,2023-08-27 19:37:51,They have charged me after I cancelled and I can’t get any assistance. This has been going on over 2 months. No response to my emails and no phone number to call. They do respond right away if you send them a message through their automated help section on their site but then ghost you after that. They claim they can’t find my account and ask for additional information and then never respond once I send them the info. I am beyond frustrated at this point and don’t know what to do. Doesn’t look like I’m getting my money back unless I file a fraud charge on my credit card and go through all the hassle that comes with that. I’m sure this is a business tactic where most people don’t notice the additional charges. Don’t fall for it and watch the charges on your card!!!,Fraudulently Charges After Cancellation - don’t fall for it
2,2023-07-25 23:50:39,I wish I could give this a better review but I reached out twice through the app on technical issues and questions and was not answered. I also signed up for a challenge in the app and the content was missing. I logged in online an the content was there but I had to pay for it again to access because the online and app are not synced. Seems that the app has some serious issues and the website is better to use but I wish I could get a refund on the app challenge and someone to respond to my questions.  Also there are no options to modify the meal plan I’d you don’t line something in the plan. I don’t like avocados so I would like to switch those meals. I like the variety of options for exercise and meal themes. Just they need to work on the bugs,Just OK
3,2023-02-16 01:33:06,"Lots of variety and options for workouts for different abilities, love that i can turn off the music. However, the workouts don’t sync between ipad/iphone so none of my calories burned show up on my phone. No reason at all why they shouldn’t be able to sync if I’m paying that much a month. Workouts also won’t save if you only complete a portion. I like the water tracker, step tracker, and mental wellness portion, but the calorie counter IS SO ANNOYING with how it only measures by oz. No one knows how much ounces a cup of quinoa is. Doesn’t even have the choice to use grams. I really love the workouts but won’t be using the app after this month because of how in-intuitive the calorie log is and not being able to sync","Good workouts, poor meal tracker"
3,2019-10-10 11:42:07,"The app itself is amazing! I love how it shows you you’re progress and how much water you should take e.c.t. I have an issue though. Payment. I know the last critic said this, but can’t the free days be more then 2 meals and three workouts? I pushed my family to follow the healthy diet but now I can’t unless I pay $9.99. I know you all put a lot of effort into this app, creators, I just wish I couldn’t get my hopes up for nothing. I mean $9.99 per week is more expensive then Netflix, $6.99 per month! I agree, you can pay for a trainer and all that extra stuff, but I’m also young and it’s unwise to spend nearly $10 per WEEK to workout. All I’m asking for is smaller prices or longer free trials. I was soo exited to be a better me, but I guess I can’t be a better me unless I pay.",Wishing it was different
3,2019-10-06 00:50:49,"I loved this app when I first got it, and after a few weeks I had to stop using it for a while, but I kept paying for the subscription, now I am back on it, but nothing will load in the app- it keeps saying there was a problem.. I tried uninstalling and installing again and that did not help as well. I started a 3 month subscription but I’d really like to cancel that and have my money back if nothing will load on it? What am I paying for? Moreover, from whatever is loading in the app, I cannot contact help or customer support and this seems just stupid.  Also can’t log weight, bcz the keypad covers the save data button and well, you can’t save any data. The videos take a lot of time to load.

2,2018-07-31 03:13:21,"At first I was loving the app and I felt like it was really working well. After about 20 days of using the app it started to glitch and I at first couldn’t even see how many reps or how long I was supposed to do a workout. Then all of the workouts got scrambled and it was timing me when it meant for a certain amount of reps. After that the I couldn’t even get into the specific workout folder to look at the workouts I was supposed to do. I should also mention that had happened over a period of days so I would think the issue was fixed and then I would just get hit with more utter disappointment. Honestly I don’t think it was worth the $10’s that I spent on it, more like 10 cents. If you’re out there looking for a good workout app, find a different one that’s free and doesn’t glitch. It’ll be much better and less stressful.",Nope.
4,2023-09-27 18:44:32,Liking this app so far but have not been it I It’s not good it. At first I couldn’t figure out how to add meals etc. Just today it asked me to add calories and took me to spot to do that so I’m learning. Was easy to scan my items but one was not right on the calories so I had to create a new listing for it to be accurate. Adding to ability for the user to edit the incorrect setting would have been easier and would be a nice update that hopefully the developers will consider.  Will update as use more of opinion changes but for now it’s easy 4 star.  Thanks in advance for continue to make update that make usability easier and faster for your subscribers.,Good so far

But once you subscribe suddenly features disappear and everything is a nickel and dime pay to play experience.  The educational material is extremely limited.  The workouts and the coaching cost extra… and whatever you do, don’t seek technical or subscription help because they say you’ll be responded to by email and you’ll never hear back (but you’ll receive almost daily emails advertising new stuff they want you to pay for), and when you go into the app to view your ticket you’ll click on it and it will come up with errors saying “failure to load”.

The music during the walk Pilates is atrocious at best.  There is sound editing issues and complete off key tones. It’s horrible and EXTREMELY distracting when I’m trying to relax and breathe through the moves.   Also, for someone like myself with long legs, I’m not able to get into several of the positions in the short time allotted.  Lastly, for moves that require feet up on the wall as in the plank position and feet up. My feet slide down the wall without without socks (maybe the paint) soo I can’t do the side steps.  An alternate move would be helpful for any positions that may slip.",Edit your yoga wall

They don’t email you your meal plan you have to get the app and that’s not what I wanted I just wanted in my eat my meal plan email to me. And it’s just wait for them to get you to pay them monthly because they hope you’ll forget that you even had to pay for the subscription for this app. It’s very misleading the app is kind of complicated to navigate and I want you to pay for more stuff in the app after you’ve already paid for whatever it is I just did this today and I am requesting a refund for my money and cancellation of the account that I had to create on this app because I don’t want itAnd the app is a headache to navigate,Misleading headache
3,2020-06-12 22:55:24,"I heard good things about the app so I downloaded it. I also heard it was supposed to have a 7 day trial. I was never given this option. The only option I was given was a yearly plan... which I did and now I’m regretting it. The food diary is very confusing. Everything is measured in ounces. I don’t eat carrots or sushi by the ounce. I tried adding a juice box, 1 serving size is 6.75 Oz according to the nutrition label. However on the app, it tried to say .4oz was the equivalent. So I’m not sure if the calories are counting correctly. Adding activities is also a pain. I’ve spent the last 3 days painting a house and laying down new flooring- but it doesn’t count any of those calories because it wasn’t “walking” or “yoga”. I also tried to add my elliptical workout and there’s no option for that either.",Frustrated
3,2019-08-18 04:55:56,"I am absolutely IN LOVE with this app.😍 I got the app and was so excited to try out the food and workouts and get that body🔥🔥 I did Day 1 workouts and then figured out that after that, you had to pay for the rest. And you also have to pay for the food. Whatever. I know that it can’t b free. I mean, it’s a effective weight loss app and it can’t b free. I liked the offer for paying 2.29 a week. But what I DIDN’T like is that you have to pay $119 right then right there if u wanted it. I was ready to pay 2.29 a week. I’m kinda mad now...I rly liked that app but now I hardly ever use it because there’s hardly a point if I about use it. So to the Better Me staff, hardly anyone will pay 119 dollars in one shot just for an app. The 2.29 a wk thin is WAYYY better. Just a tip, but PLZ look into it. Thx❤️",I like this app butttt....😑
1,2019-03-07 11:49:41,"First off, I downloaded multiple workout apps that I thought would work for me. On the app it had told me that if I wanted to see the extent I would have to pay a certain amount of money per month, etc. Being curious I decided to purchase it, BUT they gave me a FULL FREE MONTH TRIAL!!!! After the month my subscription expired, So I decided to cancel my subscription until I was able to come back and pay. In explanation I did not have money to purchase another month. So I CANCELED MY SUBSCRIPTION FEBRUARY 25TH THE DAY IT EXPIRED. It even says so in my Apple Subscription BUUT!!!!! IN MY APPLE PURCHASE HISTORY ANNND BANK ACCOUNT, They had charged me the $9.99 For the next month!!! I am absolutely upset! They took part of my rent money from my bank account, my hard earned money and even when I redownloaded the app WITH my account they said I DIDNT PURCHASE IT?!?!?!?!?

I keep getting an error saying there is a data breach and I need to change my password but no option to do so.  Everytime I log in, it asks me to “upgrade” but I did that during my sign up and can’t access it.  When I click restore my purchase, another error.

I like the idea of having all info in one place, but the preloaded data isn’t very robust, including the ability to scan barcodes, and it’s annoying to have to go back and figure out serving sizes when I’ve already done it as I loaded it. Having things in ounces instead of actual serving sizes (slices of bread for example) makes no sense to me. I’ll go back to a different app that has more preloaded food data instead of paying for this one and still having to do a bunch of work to log meals.

So I sent the support team a message and they ask for credit card info, which I gave and then…silence. I sent a number of emails and nothing. I have opened another ticket with a different question and nothing. They pulled another months worth of money out but can’t respond.

I absolutely LOVE this app!!! It does nearly everything I need it to, it’s a great motivator, it makes dieting easier, and it teaches me how to work out from home! I have little to complain about from my experience so far.  BUT (ahh there’s always a “but” isn’t there…) I wish we were able to have more control over the “Log Calories”/nutrition section. Some people’s dietary goals (carbs, fats, proteins) are different than others and sometimes it’s based on dietary preferences. For example: I live a keto lifestyle and am unable to set my carb goal to 20g max due to it being based off of my BMI. I love that I can manually adjust how many calories I wish to limit myself to, but it would be nice to be able to have it more hands-on in that sector.  But that’s really the only negative thing I have to say about this app. Toodles! 👋✨",MORE CONTROL OVER THE NUTRITION SECTION PLEASE

The meal plans are very forced and honestly most of the meal plans have foods that I don’t like or just don’t have the time to make. I wish we could try to make our own meal plans, and have the app make suggestions if we have too many carbs, sugars etc. (if you do end up allowing this please don’t make us pay). It’d be a whole lot easier to change small things in certain meals, and we’d be able to actually make food for what’s available in our homes at the time. To sum it up, allowing us to make our own meals would be great, but also adding a system where the app can give constructive criticism towards our meals. (Cal count, trans fat, etc.)","Amazing, BUT"

I believe that if I followed the meal plan properly and haven’t skipped any workout (I am extremely lazy sometimes, don’t judge me!), I would have reached my goal by now. But I am completely satisfied with the results! Both plans are very easy to follow and are CUSTOMIZED. I am emphasizing it, cause that is something that people tend to underestimate, but really it is astonishing how this app has something that everyone can use and enjoy.",Customized!

Unfortunately the calorie counting is very inconsistent and not very user-friendly. You might search a food and find several different calorie amounts. Other apps do this much better, standardizing the caloric count for a specific food and allowing you to update your portions. I currently don’t track calories only because it is really cumbersome. I wish this feature of the app was better.  The challenge workouts can be glitchy as well, which is annoying but not a dealbreaker.",Decent Health App

I know I said this already but IT’S A LOT!!! I can’t even find, in the app, to cancel this. I did want my money back BUT thats not going to happen at all. I did find a little blurb in the help section of the app to cancel or ask for your “money back guarantee” which by the way is a joke. I did what I could with the little info they give you and NOTHING! I would log my food, water and physical activity each day. I’d find that it’s gone a couple hours later.

I was intrigued, I saw that I would lose 40 pounds in just two months. The reason why I wanted my money back was because it already had my meals planned and everything. I know this sounds AMAZING but I can’t go to the grocery store everyday just for something new. And the foods were pricey! I suggest that in the survey at the begging, they ask the person what their budget is on a weekly basis.

I clicked cancel and the water part popped up, at this point I was over the app so I exited the app and deleted it. I can’t rate the app on if it helped me loose wait because I was not ready to pay $110 dollars just so I could loose 2 or 3 pounds, and maybe only use the app for a week or two even though you can pay for one week at a time but I just wouldn’t do it and start going to gym and going on jogs around the neighborhood",You want my money?
2,2019-01-04 05:37:57,The exercises and overall layout of the app is great. I like how it looks and the avatar showing all the workout actually really helps me.  What I think could improve: Why are you not able to choose or save meals from certain days? I don’t understand the whole meal thing. Like maybe they should develop a grocery list of things you should just always try to have and things that are going to be specific to the weekly meals. Otherwise NO ONE is going to benefit from the meal plan because no one has the ingredients. It would be cool if you could save/star meals that you really enjoyed so that eventually you could make your own meal plan. Don’t you want your users to be independent and use your app as a TOOL.   Another problem that bugs me is I have never received a reminder from this app to workout even though I set one everyday and also went to my phone settings and allowed the app to send me notifications. It seems like you are louring us in with beautiful graphics and then not working properly so that we forget about the app and you get our money.  Needs a lot of work.  I’d really like to see if do better considering I have now been charged $52. Seriously.,Still has a lot to improve

I have reached out to Customer support via chat TWICE and received ZERO response (says they will respond via email and, YES, I checked my spam/junk folder).   2. The “keto” plan has suggested 160g of Carbs per day, 35g Fat, and 79g of protein. This is the complete opposite of the keto diet. The meal plan when selected says “I like low carb….” And says “not for those with diabetes, etc.” My husband’s doctor recommended the keto diet to him since he is at risk for diabetes based on family history, so these comments just don’t make sense. You may be thinking, well, can’t you adjust it in your head and eat less carbs? Absolutely! But, when I am paying for a service/program/app, it should work.   3.

So far, this is not going to work for me.  1)I’m tall, so when the exercise requires full leg extension laterally, this requires a very wide open wall space.  2)the app shows a quick demo with no instructions and by the time I watched that and figured out where to position myself, then instructions are finally given, I missed out on part of the exercise time 3)I still would have to keep a separate app where I chart my food and nutrition because this one is really not adequate for that.

5,2019-07-13 03:19:56,So I like it although it’s still a little hard for me due to me being fat and over weight but what I think they should fix is telling us how many sit ups to do or mountain climbing exercises. For example they only say 12 reps but how many sit ups do I need to do for my 12 reps.. do I do 12 reps of 5 sit ups or 10 sit-ups of 12 reps etc... or simply tell us do as many sit ups or mountain climbers you want per set just do 12 . That’s my only complaint for my first day but over all. I LOVE THIS APP AND CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT I LOOK LIKE IN 30 days.

I’m not sure how much time I’m willing to invest just to ensure my calories are accurate on this app when I have another app that has such a vast database my local grocery store deli items in it. Maybe this app assumes everyone has a food scale?   Also not impressed that step tracking and exercise tracking isn’t done by using a fitness watch.

However a few things Id like to see for paying 30 for this app! -add your own workouts like say I went on a run in the day. Why not have an option to add that to the app? Instead of just completing the workout they choose. -it must be from the UK or something because a lot of foods you can’t just look up to add to the calorie counter. I have to look up the ounces on everything instead of just coming up what the container is. - unless you’re eating packaged food all day you have to look up how much each thing is you ate. Like say you had steak, a regular steak is at the very bottom of the list. Or sometimes it’s not even on the list.  - the calorie ALWAYS adds 3.53 oz of food. Why not make it cups an easy measurement for us to use instead of having to look up how many ounces are in a cup of almonds? Or a cup of popcorn, or a cup of milk. - was really excited about my “personal” meal plan. When they just think keto is going to work for everyone. Well it’s not. And there is no way to change it.  Pretty disappointed in the app especially after paying SO MUCH for it.",Needs work especially because you have to pay for it
2,2023-07-18 23:42:15,"I really wanted to like this app. I saw it being advertised for people with a lot of tightness due to stress. That is absolutely me.

I have been exercising for about 3 weeks now with the help of a personal trainer and felt like I was making small gains in my strength but not in my flexibility. When I saw the ad pop up for this app I thought it sounded wonderful. So far every exercise I have tried on this app shows a person doing it that is twisting themself into a pretzel, I can barely do a quarter of what they are doing. I don’t understand why the ads are targeted to those who are inflexible only to have no basic videos to show how to do that if you can’t get into a position shown.   It would be very helpful to have more videos either showing beginners doing the move, or showing how to modify a pose to accommodate less flexibility. It can be very glitchy as well. More talking during the videos would be helpful also. It’s hard to maintain a proper pose and look at what the instructor is doing at the same time.   I’m hoping I can get my money back.",Not good for what it advertised
1,2021-04-09 13:06:59,The majority of the stuff within the app is it best basic at least from the user experience perspective. It is extremely hard to navigate the app and input things such as food. When only ounces are allowed and it defaults to 3.53 ounces with almost every food selection. The images for the workouts do not load. When you are trying to do the fasting the starting and stopping in customization ability does not really work. Also you’re not able to go back and review your quiz results to see what your original goal is. They do l track your metrics but there’s nothing special about that would entail a fee. Then when it comes to the meal planner you’re not able to put in things that you were allergic to which makes it extremely hard to find recipes that work for you such as mushrooms peas and specific kinds of fish.,Misleading and All fluff
2,2020-11-08 15:25:17,"I found this app from a link offering a meal and workout plan customizable to your needs and body. $9.99. I thought oh it’s too good to be true but just to have a sample meal plan based off my allergies and food issues might not be a bad thing. I’ll check it out.   I found out after paying and downloading the app that there is ZERO disclaimer that the “offer” for $9.99 to receive a meal & workout plan is actually a weekly subscription.   That is deceitful and bad business. I don’t mind paying $9.99 for a one time unlock, but to then get an email the next day saying that I unlocked a week for that price and it will renew in 7 days is completely ridiculous!    On a side note, upon downloading the app, before I received the email regarding it being a subscription, I also discovered that there is a flaw in your quizzes. One asks about how often you diet or what types of dieting you’ve tried and it gives four options. None of those apply to me and so I couldn’t even finish the quiz! I also have allergies/intolerances  to MANY foods and the meal plan will never work for me if I’m unable to eat foods you set in my meal plan. So for it to say it’s fully customizable is a crock of crap!",Bad business

Layout was nice and the personalized steps/guidelines per day to reach my goal they gave me to start with was cool and I thought would help for sure, but when I went to click on the next thing to continue, it wouldn’t let me pass without wasting a ridiculous amount of money for it all, I could do all this stuff on my own and not have to waste all that money,  I just wanted the app to help guide me but clearly it’s not worth it.

I looked for an app that wasn’t aggressive with the notifications but also gave you options on wha you like as a plan to get and stay active.  I got the 3-month plan with walking workouts as my way to exercise and whoa who knew that walking was this intense? I like the water intake goal but it’s the reason I gave it 4-stars as opposed to 5. The app is sneaky and won’t let you put your water intake in unless you sign up for an additional paid portion which is the training portion I think it begins at another $30, I have the Apple Watch so this app popped up and it allows you to enter your water intake there. I thought that was a bit underhanded especially for those who don’t have the watch to go around the app.  But overall it’s a good app to help you focus on your health goals and not obsess about your weight",This app does help me!

For me, it was not worth the money. I canceled it within a week of having it, of course I was already charged for the month so I did at least 20 days. I know it couldn’t hurt me yet.

Those kinds of features are not why I got this app and they should be optional. I have stated this in several ways and they added more instead of giving me a way to remove them from my personal program.

You can do the floor without the mat but my body was sliding out of position. Also I kept having to move around my house for wall space that fit the different exercises. I wasn’t prepared for the space needed. The instructions were clear and easy to follow and super good information on body positioning against the wall. I didn’t know what to do when my flexibility didn’t allow me to keep my shoulders against the wall on one exercise. One of the purposes of doing this plan is to regain much flexibility that I have lost. Will need some suggestions for that.,Requires lots of wall space and a mat

Or even worse what if the app decides to have an update and when you open the app on the same phone you’ve been using then you’re logged out. This happened to me and I lost all my progress. I contacted the support team and they said “ We investigated this situation and were able to locate the issue. Unfortunately, the data cannot be recovered.  Also, we do not recommend logging out from the app, as some of your progress could be lost.   Issues happen with electronic goods, but this is not an excuse. I am very sorry that the progress was erased.  “ never did I see anywhere on the app that it’s my job to stay logged in or I’ll lose progress. And shouldn’t they make updates that don’t log you out!?

I’m not staring at my phone for the whole 30 seconds if I already know how to do the moves. There is a little bit too much going on to focus. It could be simplified just a tad.

I paid for a 12 week “personalized” program out of curiosity which was my own mistake. I wasn’t expecting a coach to show up at my doorstep but it’s obvious they just give everyone pretty much the exact same thing no matter how you answer their little quiz.   Turns out the personalized 12 week program was just one of those “28 day calisthenics” plans. Once you do 28 days, that’s it lol the remaining 8 weeks, you have the option to repeat the exact same 28 workouts. No progression or incremental increases.   The app is also device dependent, not account.  So if you’re on day 8 on your iPad, then you travel and try to use your phone the next day for day 9, you can’t do that.

The one thing I do like about this app is the work outs. I like how it shows you what to do and gives a timer for when you should work out. I always get caught up in things and say oh I don’t have time. They also give specific workouts for different areas.   I’m not sure if the app is new or just hasn’t had a lot of honest reviews but i think it needs some tweaking.",Work outs are Great meals not so much
3,2023-08-20 03:02:35,"I gave this app a chance for about a week and I found the most frustrating part was tracking my calories. It was very difficult to find certain things and the measurements were limited. I also found that the calories were off when I compared them with another app that got better reviews. I did enjoy the articles but I will say that I didn’t try the workouts. I was losing weight with the calories tracker so that’s why I didn’t get to those. Since calorie tracking was my biggest use, I have decided to go with another app that is much easier and user friendly. It also costs way less.",Other Food Trackers are Better

Even for someone my age, there are so many workouts to choose from. I love that I can mirror the workouts to my large tv screen. So much easier to see!  The only downside for me is the cost. Living on a very very small social security monthly income the cost is too much for my budget. I wish they would offer a low, monthly, yearly or lifetime membership fee for seniors. As much as I love this app, sadly I will have to cancel my trial membership. I will definitely miss it. The cost is the reason for only 4 stars.",Really nice workout app

I have a huge headache right now and very upset since I was still charged even though I have cancelled before my trial period ended. I HAVE CANCELLED IT IN MY APPLE APP SINCE THEY DON’T HAVE THAT OPTION IN BETTER ME APP. I don’t understand how companies like this charge you still even if you have cancelled, my brain exploded! Shame on you! I was reconsidering your app since I loved it and thought it was the best out of all the weight/health wellness! But I just gave birth like 5 days ago and wasn’t ready!!!!!

At the end of the wizard, I was charged a full month again and set up for a reoccurring subscription. I immediately emailed their support and they said I clicked on an offer. They offered me more deals to keep my money and extend my subscription to which I said NO. I have not heard back since. I have emailed, left messages on FB, and called their customer service .. which basically says all agents are busy, email them, and then hangs up.

1,2022-05-12 15:50:41,"Food: You are not able to change food amounts like if you had a 1/2 serving of something on many of the items.  You are not able to do more than 1 diet plan if you have allergies like I have a dairy and a gluten allergy yet I can only choose one or the other.  Menu: the app designers should take into account that when you sign up you probably won’t have all the items for the meals they recommend. They do give you an ingredients list but it would be nice if you could pick the foods that fit you and then be able to  move those ingredients into a shopping list, without having to copy and paste.  Medical: I realize that these app makers are not doctors or maybe not even nutritionists, and maybe they don’t wish to take responsibility. However they should be able to have enough knowledge to take into account at least the most prevalent medical conditions such as High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, and any Allergies as mentioned before.  Exercises need to be able to be more tailored to the individual by the individual.

I messaged support directly for days and received zero response. Not sure who’s behind all the BetterMe or BetterXXX anything apps but seems like a scam to me.

I am exploring with additives to my coffee and don’t want what I consume to interrupt my fast. I even put an apple and banana in to see if that would alert me, but did not.

Now the negative: there’s no way to edit your fasting, water intake or much of anything.   I don’t always track my food right away so while fasting I didn’t stop my fasting time right when I ate but instead went into the app a few hours later and wasn’t able to edit the time at all. I’m also not able to edit the food other than in ounces and at the food selectionIs quite large however rarely has what I’m looking for so I’m always having to enter it in manually. That makes it much more difficult, especially since the only option it allows for is ounces and if the product is in anything else other than ounces well you better know your stuff to enter it in correctly...

If there was a way to save ALL manual items and save it in my system so I don’t have manually enter it every day that would be amazing! Right now there is a “recent” tab but it only goes so far back.

As other users have noted, there are 7 “programs” that target a specific area of the body. Each program has 28 workouts. You have to do each program once to get a full workout so it is essential 28 workouts. But that’s it. You can’t even set your own water goals. The meals are just the same thing repeated weekly.   The ads I have seen for the app are very misleading. They show a much more in-depth program that is customizable to your body type and allow you to target specific problem areas. That is not what you will get with the app. If only as much time was put into the content of the app as is put into the content of the ads.",Great concept. Poor execution.
1,2023-08-19 12:36:58,"The app’s features are poorly designed.  First and foremost, I hated trying to log food.  Serving options should include standard measurements such as cups or teaspoons.  You should also be able to create recipes (see My Fitness Pal which is so much better!!!).  Plus, when searching for food, you cannot tell which option is the right one and which is correct (i.e. look up apples).  Second, the app does not update across devices.  I had to use only one device.   Either I chose my  ipad so I could see the exercises better or my phone which is more portable.  Third, the price is NOT worth the features.  You basically pay for daily exercise videos and a terrible calorie counter/food, water, exercise log!!!",Poor plan and application features.

There is a lot of error in these videos, particularly between the video and verbal instruction, and the two rarely match each other. A few examples just  from the Abs of Steel workout:  1. Pre workout instructions might mention we will need dumbbells and kettlebells for the workout, but not a single exercise in the workout required either piece of equipment. 2. Zero time between exercises to set up for the next one, and they don’t tell you any names of the exercises. The clock is already ticking on the next exercise when the previous exercise is ending. 3. Voice instructions might tell you to hold a stretch for 30 seconds, but the video only puts 15 seconds on the clock. 4. Voice instructions might tell you to keep your legs a few inches off the ground but the actor is doing it completely differently.

Right now the work out has you standing then sitting, then standing then on your back then standing again for two rounds, then down on your back for another round.

Other thing that I think it will be very useful is if you could have more options for the measuring units when logging in your food, example: cups, tbs, and not only ounces, also to have the option of saving previous foods and choose from there, so you don’t have to type everything again, app saves a few or the last ones, but not all of them..  One more thing that it will be very helpful is that if your meal options could change and update when you change your meal plans..

I had considered joining a gym but when your first starting to exercise you can only do a few minutes at a time. For me it was a waste of money to go up to a gym to work out for 15 minutes (at the most) and then go home. When I’m able to work out at home for an 1hr or more then I might join a gym until Better Me is perfect.,Wow this app is amazing
1,2019-04-09 02:47:47,"If you asked me yesterday (day 28)  what I would have rated this app, I would have given it 5 stars. Now, after I have finished their 28 day challenge, I don’t have other options for more workouts. Even if I were to restart from day 1, I am still unable to change the intensity of each workout. I would like to continue using this app being that I paid for a 6 month subscription only if someone can guide me in the right direction of changing or updating my workouts. I see under “community” there are plenty of different workouts available for people to do without “tracking”...  Please help me understand what else I need to do. If this is the only option for a 6 month subscription, I would rate it a poorly advertised 1 star.  I would gladly change my rating accordingly.",After 28 Days?
5,2021-12-24 15:05:36,"The app is great, but you guys should change it to allow for you to connect your Fitbit so that you can see your Fitbit stats here. Why? Because Fitbit has a sucky system for their health and exercise, you guys do a much better job. You should also add your app to the Fitbit App Store so that you can add and check your stats right on your Fitbit. What impressed me the most is how easy everything is to use. The amazing flow of things is incredible. You guys did a great job making this app.",Love the App! One thing should change though…
2,2023-02-06 13:00:44,"I would like to think I would enjoy this app if I could get it to work consistently. Every day it tries to get me to purchase a different subscription and it won’t restore my current subscription. So I am not able to enter into my plan. Sometimes if I remove the app and restore it, it works,  But then that starts me back at day ones program and really who wants to do that every day for the next three months?! I don’t want to sign up for this new subscription, (although it is a good deal) until I’m done with my current three month plan. Have reached out to tech-support and they just don’t seem to get it.

1,2022-05-17 00:00:20,"The meal plans don't allow you to submit any input about what you like and don’t like so at least half of a week’s meals are not helpful because, for example, I’m not going to eat porridge for breakfast (literally, one of the breakfasts calls for porridge).  Plus, it assumes people have time and are at home to cook 3 meals a day... seriously?  Shortly after I signed on the app encouraged me to work with one of their personally coaches by asking a lot of goals questions. So I submitted a question to one of the coaches. I was a little surprised that I had to pay extra for that but I said ok, paid $3.99, and saw a message that the individual usually responds within an hour or so.   It's been 24 hours now and not only hasn't there been any response, the only evidence that I submitted a question is that I've been charged $3.99 (in addition to my initial subscription charge).  I'm starting to think this app is a scam. I've already turned off auto-renew so we'll see if after my initial week I get charged even more. I certainly hope not because this program has been useless.   What a waste of money.",Misleading and a waste of money
3,2017-12-05 20:45:42,"I like that the workouts target different regions of the body and aren't time consuming. I like that they give you meal options. But, there should be way more interaction for this app to be $10 a month. There should be a grocery/ meal prep list. You should be able to log your food if you decide to not use the planned meals given. During the workouts there should be some motivational speaking and maybe count the reps as well. There should be a way to track your progress and at the end of each day show a summary of how many calories you've burned. For me personally it's not worth $10. I don't mind paying but I just don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth.",I'm on the fence

It is not easy to skip forward and backward on your videos in order to do all the ones with the parallel to the wall and all the ones with a perpendicular to the wall in a row. I waste so much time getting up and down from the floor to move the darn yoga mat. It is very frustrating.

I go to the tickets on the app and now there’s technical difficulties. It won’t open but I can definitely see the preview of my issue telling the help contact I didn’t ask for the subscription.

I’m a busy person, so there are days where sometimes I have to skip a week day or two and allow my workouts from those day to move to the weekend. Well, I tried to log in once and it said “subscription expired”. So you pay for all of the days, but don’t get to use them? Unless you do them exactly when scheduled? Doesn’t really make sense to me and I feel as if I wasted some money.

I’ve seen so many apps that promise you’ll lose an insane amount of weight in such a short amount of time. I have no idea why I chose to actually download this one, but I’m seriously glad I did. I never pay for anything (since i’m 14 haha) but I decided it was worth it.   I’ve lost 7 pounds in 4 days on the higher intensity setting of this app, and I’ve never been able to stick to any diet or workout plan before. It’s just so simple and easy. Definitely worth my money.","Guys, it seriously works"

My flexibility has been shot to heck and I think in all this may work for me. My only complaint is I wish they would do all floor based exercises together as it is a struggle to go back and forth.

I’m sure it’s a good site - but if you’re not really ready to use it - realize they will be constantly charging your cc and will not give it back.  Update: Don’t be fooled by the responses to the comments, they do NOT refund your money.

We could click next when we’re ready to do the next workout. I paid for it because I loved it. I’m new to working out so all I needed was some home workouts, food tips, and a pace I felt comfortable following. I’m pretty bummed with this new update, each workout is now one video that feels super rushed and timed. I liked the vibe of the old one where you could choose which specific area to work on. They were only like 7 min long each so you could combine it all to make one great workout. Wish I knew they were planning on changing the app before I purchased.",Hate the updated version

I’m a want to see results person so I added a 2 mile brisk walk to get my daily steps in and alternating core/cardio for 20 minutes daily.

After going to the app’s website, I realized that the app actually signs you up for a seven-day free trial after which it charges you $50 for a six-month subscription.   I checked other reviews to see how others resolved this problem. The app developers responded by saying that we get to choose the plan we opt into — I had absolutely no options pop up to choose from or ANY idea of costs tied to the app. In addition, the developers said that the app may not show up in your subscriptions if you opted into the lifetime plan. Again, I made NO choice. The app opted me into their BS plans to charge me after the free trial.   I have found no way to cancel the payment before the trial is over. When I contacted Apple, they told me I had to talk to the app developers. So now I’m stuck in this back and forth between both companies. I’ve emailed Better Me as well.   I refuse to be charged for this app which I have not used and do not plan to use. Get me out of this.

It’s very basic in the options, zero customization, only tracks weight not BMI, which is way more important. I want to track FAT loss, not weight loss. I want to track calorie intake, total real calories burned (not what the app estimates I burned with their exercises) and progress pics. None of that here.",For Beginners to Exercising

It was very uncomfortable and confusing to be standing up and then back down either against the wall or facing the wall. It take too long to get settled   As with the instructions, talk about the movements and correct positions WHILE you are showing the movements. The video first shows the moves and when you start the exercises with the timer the explanation starts and we end up doing everything correctly at the last couple of seconds. Which prevents us from getting the full advantage of the workout.   Hope you consider these comments since I’m used to doing many workouts at home and tried many videos on utube and DVD’s.

It keeps trying to sell me things I already paid for. Frustrating.  The app would be better if the meal options showed you the calories on the picture instead of making you open and scroll to the end to get this information. There is no way to go back and add data to a previous day.   This app is not as easy as other to use. The meal and snack options are good and provide good options so you don’t feel like you’re eating the four or five meals everyday. If I could give 2 1/2 stars I would.

Why on earth would this thing try to bill me $40 a month and then offer to bill me $20 for the whole year. It’s just dishonest. 3. I actually like the app. Sure the calories may not be dead on for every food item, but if you’re cutting it that close the problem isn’t the app, it’s your eating habits. 4.

Then if you want to join a group you have to pay another $30.

Also did I miss a tutorial on the meals?? I don’t keep all that great kind of food around so it was a shock when it came time to fix breakfast the first day and I had to skip it!  Do you have a shopping list that I don’t know about? I am really struggling here and want to make it work but I feel like I am flunking out and I only just got started!!!,Great idea!

So now I can’t continue because i have to buy the subscription first. I don’t recommend you this app if you’re willing to pay. I think it’s very stupid because then how are you supposed to workout? I had a bad experience and I don’t like this app, you can disagree, but i don’t like it because i have to pay and i didn’t think I had to (for the workouts and stuff) i thought it was only for the meal plan.

The only way I was able to not receive a charge this last time was because I needed to cancel the card I had used to sign up.

The iPhone is too small and when I logged in on my iPad it started me on day 1 as if I hadn’t used it before.

Food measurements are not user friendly as you have to look up how many ounces equal to whatever you truly measure your food by.   The workout videos are very robotic. I use Nike Training Club and saw this advertised. It was like a combination of My Fitness Pal for the food and Nike Training for the workouts. They have a lot more work outs than NTC, but I couldn’t even get through one... the lady’s voice is so robotic and fake. She doesn’t talk in complete sentences, she doesn’t take any pauses, and when you’re moving onto the next workout she doesn’t even finish her sentence. She gets cut off. The whole “close The gate” saying at the end of every workout got to me... it’s like horrifically stuck in my head.   I hope y’all take these reviews to improve.

I decided today to go in to my iPhones storage manager to see what the heck was going on and it turns out this app was eating 20GB worth of space! How is that even possible?

They thought I was an ectomorph and obese based off weight alone. Have you seen bodybuilders!? This is not true personal training or nutrition planning so it shouldn’t cost two friggin streaming services. You are being scammed if you think this app will help you.

The most annoying factor is that this app lags a lot!!! It takes for ever to load or open a page.

Unfortunately, logging out and logging back in did not fix the issues.  It meant restarting EVERYTHING. Well, it kept the step count data from my Apple Watch (smh).

That said, the fee to play can vary wildly depending on what plan you choose. Already expensive at $9.99 per week (per week was in tiny print, they advertise this as a by-day fee) once you get into the app you are constantly barraged with pop ups to “add-on” six pack abs or hard weight lifting for “only” $20-30 more! same goes for the workouts, you don’t get all of them for $40 a month, only some!

It would be incredibly helpful if this was an option.   A second problem I would run into is that once I had completed a workout and press “finish” the app would crash and not save any of my progress. This is frustrating for obvious reasons.   Thirdly, I don’t have Facebook so therefore it is very difficult to create an account. It would be preferable to me and to others who don’t have Facebook to add a ‘sign in with email’ option. However this is not as important to me as the first two.   Overall, this is a wonderful concept of an app for those who cannot afford a gym membership or a personal trainer.

This makes little sense. iPad users are more likely to leave their iPad in landscape mode.  - logging food intake is really poorly designed. Get inspiration from MyNetDiary.

This was with doing this app, dieting, and 10 minuets of cardio. But now that I am on day 13 I have lost motivation to use the app because it has became boring. I am more of a weight lifting and going to the gym kind of person and this app just became boring to me. I do love the app and recommend it for someone who does not go to the gym or does not like lifting weights. It is an amazing app that really works.",Good App
5,2021-07-13 16:59:17,I have to praise the developers of this app for including workouts for ALL body types and levels of ability. Not only do they start with newbie through advanced trainers but they offer wheelchair exercises!! I will say it again WHEELCHAIR friendly exercises!! You have no idea how good it is to have this option. My husband is a veteran who is wheelchair bound and now he has exercises made for him that we can do together. Thank you so much!!,Inclusive to ALL body types!!
4,2023-07-12 13:26:35,"I really like this app, one of the things I suggest to change is the amount of time for each exercise. 16 seconds for a beginner or someone working their poor range of motion for example could only get maybe 3 repetitions.  Also the mat has to be adjusted from horizontal to vertical during the training- this could be a lot but maybe organize the exercises in a way that the mat is facing one direction for half of the training and then flip for the other half.",Some improvements
2,2023-06-05 02:16:55,"I don’t know about you, but I’ve been disappointed more than once by apps that look like a great idea but after the initial app download, you find there‘s only an option for a trial period and a monthly subscription fee firewall. This is one of them. I think I need this app, but maybe not enough to pay approx $15 a month for it. And I don’t want to wrestle yet again to cancel a subscription I didn’t want in the first place. So, I immediately deleted it.  I’ll pay that much for a video once before paying the same amount monthly to an app.",There is no free version - just a trial and then a monthly fee

It keeps reading that I need to restore my purchase. I have clicked restore and every time it displays “oops sorry there is a problem on our end”.  So then I went to cancel. Unfortunately it appears that it has taken the $20 for the yearly subscription so I cannot cancel until 2024. So now I have an icon on my phone, of an app that I have paid for, that I do not have any access to. Was really excited about using it to help with health, however, so far this has been a bad experience.",Can’t access the app
1,2022-05-18 14:22:17,The free version is supposed to get you access to a personal daily plan but after a few days it doesn’t let you access it anymore. When you go to the “plan” page it says “unlock my plan” and when you click it you have to pay to proceed. Contacted them and they said the free version only gets you limited time access but it never mentioned anything about limited time access anywhere. So with the free version you really only get access to limited workouts and logging weight. I’d try paying for it but after reading some of the reviews I think I’m better off just looking for a different app to use.,False advertising
5,2019-07-09 23:40:01,"Great app! I love this it helps a lot with easy and fast exercises! And I mean easy, I am not a flexible or athletic person so if I can do these things I am sure you can too. And this app is also really good if you have a busy schedule the work outs take no time at all! The only down side to this app is you can not view the recipes for a healthy meal, smoothies, etc. unless you pay money.

Yet they’ve charged me last month and this month now. I don’t use the app nor do I want to. I’m not happy with this.

I don’t want to eat corn meal and butter for breakfast, thank you very much. “Grapes” with a recipe of “wash grapes, then eat” is actually on there - with 96% (hard coded into the app I’m assuming) people wanting to “try the recipe again”. Fire your PM, seriously.   Their money back guarantee is the biggest joke of them all, do not trust, they will tell you you need to eat their cornmeal for a month, take pics, prove you ate it, and if you don’t lose weight then they’ll give it back.

You also have absolutely no way to change your start date on a challenge, so the day you sign up for it is the day it starts - there should be some way to change the date or have it be flexible on rescheduling workouts.

This apps features including during workout doesn’t spend the time before the timer begins to tell you the technique but rather waits until the timer is ticking! It is also not very useful for calorie tracking due to lack of know what “Asian-salad is  which” and has no note for when you ate  Super disappointed  Just another influencer trying to bank without full execution  Zeebee is free and better then this  Hopefully she gets it together and does a better job for her real followers,Or worth $

I purchased 2 in error and notified customer service and it was literally tooth and nail to get a refund and even then, it was only a partial one.

The next day or so I had a charge to my account from them.

1,2019-08-20 21:16:02,So let me get this straight the first day of starting all the workouts are free but the second day needs to enable the subscription to pay that’s not fair I recommend to not do please do that on the next update that because it was my first time working out and I was so happy that I finally found the app I need for working out this made me so upset and disappointed i recommend the subscription should be for exclusive stuff for example a more tense workout or like some other stuff please do that. The first day I got the app I rated 5 stars but today I decreased it to 1 because of what I saw :((  And this new update is the worse y’all just made it harder for people to work out I hate this app,Disappointed

Some of these I definitely would like to try, but I don’t have the ingredients. I know I can just tap on each day, and it’ll tell me. Yet out of convenience, I think they should include a grocery list for the week. So that way you have the ingredients for the meals each day.

You guys should make your money based on how many people download the app and use it and write reviews, this app should be free.

It doesn’t allow you to search meal options based on specific criteria (as for example a particular ingredient) so it makes it long and boring to scroll down to see if you find something that fits your needs. The food and calorie login option is not complete enough... there are to many pantry staples that the app does not have registered for nutritional information, and there I no option to add it your self. You cannot add a recipe that you prepared for the app to calculate the calories.

No barcode to scan, many of the foods that pop up don’t have nutritional values plugged in-only calories.  Tons of workouts options which is great, but they are a series of 1 min video clips with a move and voice over. Not an ideal or motivational workout video. Especially with yoga-there is no flow to it. I’m still playing around with it and I hope I see more value in it!",Needs a few updates
1,2023-08-25 17:07:02,"I purchased a subscription back in June and asked to cancel mine in July but was offered 3-month free account until November without further subscription needed.   Then on August 19, I was charged another $15 and immediately contacted them and questioned why. They said I purchased another one because I cancelled the July membership which is still active till November as they promised?!?? Why would I need to purchase a other while mine is still active??? I asked for a refund and they continued to offer another 3-month till December?? They just don’t want to refund me for what I didn’t purchase and disappeared without any further discussion.   They illegally charged my account without my permission and everytime I contacted them, they would say I was the one purchasing it and offer for 3-month free subscription. This is unacceptable and so unprofessional.   Be careful on what you guys are purchasing and make sure yours is not charged additional fees once you cancel it.",BE CAREFUL WITH THIS APP
5,2018-09-01 18:12:22,"Everyone writing bad reviews is because they don’t know how to go to their apple setting and CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION. That is NOT the apps fault. That’s on you.   This app is WONDERFUL.  I used to be a full time gym member. i would work out everyday after work, and rest on the weekends. Since then, i’ve started going to school full time as well as working 40 hours.   From my first workout i knew this app was going to meet expectations. It provides step by instructions for the work out, as well as going your own pace. AMAZING for people who are just starting out. They also have workouts for people who are used to working out everyday.   10/10 recommend this app to EVERYONE.  Great job, BetterMe.

After 2 days i want to cancel but cannot find ANY way to do it via the app. There is literally NO way to access my subscription or profile that I can find.   The exercises are ok, but there is little to no instruction on how to do them, unless you want to stop the video and read. One instruction said to have your feet close together yet the photo had the instructor with feet apart.    The instructor in the video does not talk or explain anything. Not proper technique, not what to concentrate on, nothing. In fact, the instructor is shown doing one or two reps and then video just goes on repeat for 30 seconds. Not at all helpful.   I don’t want a refund, just to make sure I’m not charged the ridiculous $30 a month when my trial month ends. This app so NOT worth it. There are better apps better videos out there for a whole lot less money, and even free.",Not what is advertised

I tried contacting them a week ago (just 48hrs after signing up) for a refund and I’ve yet to hear back. I did see their refund policy which is the worst refund policy I have ever seen. Customer satisfaction is absolutely not on their list of priorities according to their policy. I’ve never seen such a thing where you have to try it for 7 days before getting a refund. Buyers remorse for me. I guess I’m out the $15 dollar for an app I didn’t use at all. That’s $15 stupid tax I suppose.,"Not impressed, customer service non-existent"

I’ve also gotten an error message when I try to access my profile for weeks now and no one responds to help requests. I’ve sent probably six or seven and it’s crickets.

I might have given up if it wasn’t for this app. I’m 3.5 weeks in now on my fitness journey and getting stronger everyday. Thank you!,Seriously try this app

It is a choice on the app so I was initially delighted. However, after I chose it, it didn’t have the specs accounted for so it didn’t credit me any protein. There is no way for me to add the protein points. Also, I did not eat the entire bowl but there is no way to say that I had 2/3 of it, and no way to edit my calorie intake. After that, I tried to do the workouts. The videos simply do not work. I was stuck waiting for each to get going and wasn’t able to clock out or ahead.",App is horrible

So my goals are weight gain and improved muscle tone, so many things are geared towards weight loss, I can’t even adjust my total calories goal! The reading is focused on weight loss too.

Otherwise it’s a perfectly adequate app.",Too focused on weight LOSS.

I was happy that I had finally found an app that was for me and when I had clicked see plan it wanted me to pay for my plan. I’m a college student who is trying to have low monthly expenses and the fact that I have to pay 20 a month for an app and pay for a gym membership really disappointed me.

I tried to get a refund and they just responded back saying I already had the app and started using it. I told them I can look all this stuff up myself without having to pay for it. I just wanted a refund. They sent me a link saying I had to show pictures of the meals, made EXACTLY like the recipe states and there had to be a minimum of 15 meals in order for them to consider a refund. Not happy at all.

Outside of this, I took a look at the app, and it seems mediocre. There are way better science based apps out there that can help you with your fitness goals without body shaming.

4,2019-03-13 22:24:19,I like the look of this app. It’s easy to follow. I wish there was a section for modified exercises. Some of the things that are listed as easy must be talking about people who are already fit and are just looking tone up some. Not really weight loss exercises. I’m just starting out with some of this and I’m not athletic by any means so some of it I’m not able to do.

5,2019-07-26 01:59:06,I’ve always felt so bad because of my body I would be so happy and be like oh I don’t need to be skinny to be happy one day and then the next day I would see my friends and how they’re skinny and beautiful and I would get so sad and frustrated with myself so when I stumbled upon this app I was like let’s give this a try I tried diets working out it never worked and I hope this app could help me!,I will give it a try hope it works!
5,2023-08-13 01:32:38,"This app helps me prioritize my mental health. I was wasting time in the gym not knowing exactly what I was doing without a trainer. This app helped me be more consistent, but also concise in the workouts that would give me the results I desire. I take this with me to the gym every day and don’t know if my body would’ve ever changed if I didn’t have this! Thank you a million times over, BetterMe! A BetterMe is here!",I was WASTING TIME!
4,2019-02-17 12:47:39,"This app is amazing and easy to use. I personally don’t work out but this has made things easy and simple. They only thing is with the food diet it shows you can choose no preference, gluten free, lactose free, vegetarian and keto - diet. I know of people who would love to use the app but there both gluten and lactose, or there gluten with a nut allergy and stuff like that. If you just need the workout though and you can use one of those 5 options for the food, then this is the app for you!",Love it but the dieting options
1,2018-07-31 20:51:24,I wanted to look into the app to see what it was like before purchasing. After accepting the terms and conditions and clicking on the monthly payment of $9.99 after a 3 day free trial I was instantly billed and had not even begun my trial. I am upset by the false advertising and there is no where to call and get a refund. Even after canceling the subscription it is showing up as a monthly purchase I made which is not the case. If you are looking to just look into an app I would not trust this one because I was billed without a choice and before my trial even began. I am very disappointed and turned off to even exploring the app because of this.,DO NO PURCHASE (Lied about free Trial)
1,2023-11-03 20:24:22,"This is a terrible app. And the customer service is even worse. If you have any issues don’t think you will ever get answers. I was charged over $200, and I only opened the app twice. It wasn’t user friendly and the notifications were beyond annoying. When reaching out to cancel and get a refund I have heard nothing. I have sent several emails with no reply other than “we need more information”… Ive given them all the information they need and they send automated responses. I have had to dispute the charges with my bank. If you love throwing money away, this is your app.",DO NOT PURCHASE
3,2023-10-16 14:40:23,"You need to explain the exercise during the prep time not after the exercise begins. Some of the explanations take up the the entire length of the exercise. If you have mobility issues or don’t quite understand the set up, the exercise time has elapsed and you’re not even ready for the next exercise.  Also, some of the video examples do not match the verbal explanations. Specifically, the seated lower back stretch for one.  Overall, the programs are ok, but I’d prefer smoother transitions.",Exercise explanation timing

My intention was to begin doing wall yoga as soon as I can, but I am still healing from a broken ankle and I need shoulder surgery so there’s not much I can do right now, the point is I did not realize I was paying $30 a month for the last month or I would’ve been using this to the best of my ability at this time.",Hadn’t Even Started Yet
3,2023-10-01 11:43:59,"I was very upset with this app when I learned it automatically renewed despite not being listed in my subscriptions managed through the Apple app. I paid $30/month which is definitely too much for such a simple app!

4,2023-08-02 12:55:43,I like the pace of the workouts and the videos give great reference for how to do the exercises so far without having to stop what you’re doing and clicking to watch. Best approach on the half dozen or so fitness apps I’ve tried including a personal trainer.    Their caricature representations of what someone in their 50s looks like is kind of decrepit so I’m thinking the developers are all in their 20s and have no idea that 50 doesn’t = deathbed.,Good pace - questionable representation
5,2019-08-31 15:37:38,"This app is great! I have tried it out for a few days and it’s fun and provides daily motivation. I don’t wish to start my subscription now but rather at a later time.  The app does not allow you to cancel on the app during the trial phase. It does state that you can cancel it later, which I assume it’s after at least one charge. This creates an issue for me as I wish to cancel before I get charged.  Apple cannot cancel it as well because it’s not an official active subscription either. Apple states that I should not expect to be charged so we shall see how that goes.   Otherwise, it’s a pleasant app to use for three key areas for weight loss which is reasonable eating, exercise and motivation readings and the right mindset.",Cancellation of subscription issue
4,2019-02-20 17:00:40,I am a freshman in college and have found it difficult to find time and money to go to a gym but this app has allowed me to take 10-30 minutes ( depending on the workout) out of my day to feel better about myself. I do wish there was more options that you didn’t have to pay for because I currently don’t have the budget to pay for for intense stuff on the app. I have already recommended it to my friends and they love it as much as I do.,Freshman 15 stays off!!!
2,2019-05-07 09:29:37,I liked the daily recipes suggestions until I realized its the same recipes over and over. The app is boring and uninspiring. I lost interest after a couple days and unfortunately forgot to cancel the subscription. It wouldn’t be that big of a deal if I actually felt I was getting my money’s worth. The majority of the information offered as far as workouts and meal plans are available for free elsewhere on the internet. I’m not sure what makes this developer think they have something worth $20 a month. Don’t waste your money.,Not sure why they feel the app is worth $20 a month
4,2018-10-04 17:49:14,"I was not terribly please with the diet provided within the app, but I LOVE THE WORKOUTS!  If you don’t like to workout or are not committed, then this app might not be for you. I love that it goes through 4 levels of intensity in each category of workout and builds you up to the highest level. I have been using this app for 10 days and have seen wonderful improvement in my strength already. I also like that there are a variety of exercises for each workout category.",Great app if you are committed
5,2023-01-22 05:30:43,Just getting started back up after three mean injuries in less than one year! Most of the exercises I can do for do alternatives that I know from working out for so long. I really like the options as well. my husband is in the other room and I didn’t want him to hear the music so I was able to turn it off. Things like that are nice touches.,Great low impact
2,2018-02-15 16:54:05,"This app seemed like a great idea and, like most people, I downloaded the app with every intention of using it. I have no problem with paying for a service but before I realized my free trial was up, it automatically renewed for a PREMIUM membership. I'm not sure why it would automatically assume I would want to pay $40+ for something I haven't had a chance to use yet and commit to that length of time when there are shorter/cheaper subscription levels. Instead of being happy with the service, I'm disappointed that an app would do this and turned off to actually using it. 🤷🏻‍♀️",Nice. But Deceiving
1,2023-08-10 15:01:33,"I bought into the app, used it for 12 days out of the 30. Then it crashes and lost all my data and saved workouts. I had to deal with CS who said, sorry your data is lost. I could not start back at day 13 but had to start back at day 1. Then cancelled my subscription and figured I’d have access to the 30 days of workouts that I already paid for. Ha! Silly me. Once the time ran out all my paid for works outs were gone. I would not buy into this subscription service again. Note any other. There are workouts availabe for free online and do just fine.",This app is a rip off!
2,2023-04-25 05:02:11,"So many great things all in one place - love the concept. My current focus is tracking calories. It’s kind of a mess. I could handle the annoying redundancy of the different options, for a bit. Then noticed that my calories were different each time I logged in, something was resetting my calories on food already entered. So tedious.  Additionally. I bought it for the wall Pilates work out that were advertised on social media…only to find out there were very few actual workouts of that kind. A little bummed.",Lots of potential

It’s still active in my play store I’ve used the same email for the last 10 years so it’s not another email being used. I just want back into my account and be able to use something I paid for. It’s getting a one star because they somehow lost my account and won’t help me. Once they fix the issue I have no problem giving them a 5 star.,My account is just gone
5,2019-02-07 01:26:38,I have downloaded quite a few of these types of apps and I was never really impressed with them so I never followed through.

1,2021-02-15 01:25:48,"The app itself has a nice UI and seems to have a lot of great content.  I would even consider giving it a long term try in the future but, I have cancelled my “subscription” for these reasons:  1.  I was led to believe (from a Facebook click-through) that I was paying $10 for a one time service.  After reading all of the info, ya, I signed up for a subscription.  This is on me. Today I get a random 2nd $10 charge....  2.  I cancelled my sub, which is not managed through the App Store, and immediately lost access to their website.  A website hat you can only apparently access if you have an active subscription.  But, as I was cancelling it reminded me that I could use the subscription, through the app, until my sub is up.  So...how can I manage my account if I can currently not access it because my access to the site was terminated after cancelling.  Pretty fishy IMO.  I will eat the $20 and move on.

You will need to supplement your workouts and if you are trying to lose weight it will be a diet overhaul. if you think the models in the advertisements, look that way because of these workouts, no way.

4,2023-05-30 15:29:19,I like it overall but the main thing I don’t like is how you can’t skip through the workouts and pick and choose. It’s annoying that the app forces you to do a workout for a certain area of the body when you might not be feeling that today and it would feel better for your body to pick a workout for a different set of muscle groups.,Get rid of the locked workouts please

I have a very busy life, sometimes I get around to do my exercises late in the evening and if I start it close to midnight and end after midnight it will count my exercise towards the next day.

I tried to log out to see if there was a glitch and it removed all my logged info for the days I worked out and now I can’t watch any videos except day 1.  Why even continue a monthly subscription if I have to wait 3 days for customer service to get back to me. That’s more days I lost doing the workouts.,If you miss a day you’re out of luck

And today it erased alllll of my data and I had to start back at day 1, it’s really frustrating that I made good progress now I have to start again. But other than the crashing I do greatly enjoy this work out app!!",Love the app but...
5,2023-08-22 23:06:38,"Today is the beginning of a journey that I have put off for years and the exercises were very doable for this overweight 60 yr old and I feel refreshed and can’t wait to do tomorrow’s work out, (which does not feel like any work out I’ve done before, it helps my joints and stretches my muscles ( what I have left of them, lolol) I’m very excited about this!!!",First day
4,2018-07-12 13:05:08,I just want to cancel this subscription before I am charged again! I barely used it and it is taking up space on my phone. There is nowhere in the app that allows you to cancel the subscription. Only makes mention that you can but doesn’t give you the option to do so. I only saw that you must cancel in iTunes???? I even saw this in a completely unrelated section of the app in TINY letters. Please cancel my subscription now.  Thank you.,Just want to Cancel
3,2018-05-16 02:12:54,"I honestly love the app, if you don’t have time to go to the gym it’s a great way to boost your energy and endorphins. If something was too easy or boring, I added weights or changed it to make it more difficult. My only complaint is that after the 28 days the work outs end, so you can either start over or quit paying for it I guess. That would be my only suggestion, After you finish the first month add another. Unfortunately, After I finish the 28 days on all sections I will be canceling. It’s a great app though!",More workouts
5,2023-07-08 02:19:12,I love this app! it provides a variety of workouts & challenges to meet individual need/ interest.  Short workouts for those of us whose lifestyle don’t grant us the freedom of hourly workouts multiple times a week. Although the workouts are short you definitely feel the burn. Most importantly it’s an app that doesn’t break the bank!,This is it!
5,2021-09-05 19:16:13,"I love this app! If you’re someone who just doesn’t know where to start with exercising then this is a must have. The only thing I would suggest is to give people a little bit of time to get into positions during the workouts, sometimes I feel like I wasted half the time for the workout just getting into position for it.",Amazing workout app!
2,2023-03-06 19:57:53,This app is organized well until it comes to logging your food. There are way too many options for the same thing and the weight shows different calories depending on what you choose. Really confusing and makes me feel like it just not accurate.  It also would be very helpful to show how much of an item to buy at a store if you’re going to give food options. Saying 2 oz versus a week of a meal plan with a shopping list is the convenience this app needs,Great idea but not well executed
4,2023-01-30 23:03:07,"I would give this 4.5 stars if possible. I love so much about this app, especially the workouts and meal plan/recipes, but logging food is hard. Please add cups, tablespoons and teaspoons besides the 3.4 ounces of just about everything. Where did they come up with 3.4ounces? Also, it would be handy to be able to log fractions of a serving. Sometimes, I would like to have a food but, not a whole serving. Thank you!",Need more food measurements
2,2022-08-26 14:25:44,"At this point I’ve only used the food log. It is hard to use. For instance, if I type in cheerios it gives me a bunch of options like 1.1 oz & 114 cal and another 1.1 oz & 149 cal. There are no measurements like 1 cup. I end up using another app that lets me pick the unit (cups, oz, grams, etc) then pick the amount (1/2, 1, 2, etc). Then I figure out the calories & come back to better me to plug it in. I am trying the app because of the dancing videos, which I haven’t tried yet. Hopefully they are good enough to compensate for the really bad food log.",Food log hard to use
5,2019-05-30 12:41:30,I get that you guys are trying to get  money somehow but you guys should really make the food button because that’s the whole reason people are losing because they are going on diets so if they can’t say what they had for breakfast your gonna lose money because people rather go on a diet but also please keep the workouts and the water thing if you make the food free PLlEASE KEEP THE WATER AND THE WORKOUT,Fix The Food Button
1,2021-07-25 22:49:56,So I tried to use this app but I could not find it as a realistic solution for me. I did not find the app easy to use and the recipes were not for my taste. Then after not using the app after only a couple weeks. Imagine the surprise when I see that a huge charge for this was on my bill again. I canceled but before the cancellation went through it charged to another payment source. I reached out but it seems customer service completely ignored my question and only repeated information I already knew. Save your money and try another app.,Worst experience
3,2021-07-14 13:54:45,"i loved this app truly until i wasn’t able to access my work out without paying for premium. i am 16 years old, i cannot afford the premium price nor would i pay for the premium price if i could afford the price. it was very frustrating to fill out all the information and get destiny to work out to reach my weight and muscle mass that i would like just for it to be locked. i do you understand the app needs to make money but there are more features, including diets and one-on-one training, that is part of the premium package. they shouldn’t make your plan part of the premium package after certain amount of time of using it. i’ve had the app for a week and now i’m not able to continue w/ my plan.","wonderful app, but you have to pay for your plan after a week"
3,2021-06-29 04:07:40,"I bought this app a year ago and I do like the extra features, but if we’re being honest… it’s really not that much extra you’re getting. There’s a lot on this app that you still have to pay more for and I think that’s ridiculous, because you’re already paying for a subscription so why do you have to pay more for challenges etc? Doesn’t make sense. I will never subscribe to this app again.",Do not buy this app… there’s no point
2,2021-03-22 06:00:08,"This works well if you are just tracking your own info, but they don’t have an option in the meal plan to avoid certain things. I cannot eat most seafoods and even though I put it in, seafood is almost daily in the meals. You can’t track your measurements besides weight. They have normal workouts free, but every single challenge costs a couple bucks. If you eat a food that isn’t on their list you have to reinput it every single time you eat it because it doesn’t save.  This app works, but there are better ones","Honestly, there are better apps"
1,2021-01-31 15:59:52,"This app is not easy to use, and if you miss  entering a meal the day before you are out of luck. It won’t let you add it. The steps section would never connect to my phone so I stopped using it after the first month or two. There are also add ins that require additional payments if you want access to them. Make sure to carefully review the checkout page if you decide to purchase or do the free trial as they auto renew every six months and they will not give you a full refund once the renewal processes. Bottom line in my opinion this app is not worth the $40 they charge every six months.",Watch The Charges/Not Worth the Cost
3,2021-01-30 19:25:23,So I’ve been using this app for about 3 months just to track my fasting and walking and stuff and bought the 20 dollar yearly subscription. I then noticed all these weird 10 and 5 dollar charges on my card labeled as pays fit and or health charge. I think they taken about 90 dollars out of my account so far and I’m in the middle with a dispute with my bank over this so I wouldn’t use your card for this at all.  Update: they fixed the issue and are refunding the money so A+ for customer service,Sketchy app
2,2020-03-30 21:52:29,I completed the workouts and used my apple watch to track the calories I was burning while doing the workout. The page that said the workout I was about to complete said I was going to burn 350 calories. That’s was inaccurate! I burned like 100 calories. I feel like it just says you are going to burn a bigger amount than how many calories you actually burn to try to get you to buy the subscription.  I tested this 5 times and all the times I never burn even close to how much it says.,The calories it says you burn you really don’t!!
4,2018-08-31 15:50:03,I love this app! I only gave it 4 stars because I can’t afford to pay that much money a month so I’m only doing the 7 day trail. Also some of the workouts I’m not strong enough to do yet. I still try them but it’s very hard for me to because I’m a beginner and I had knee surgery. Soo maybe making sure clients built the strength ability to move forward and also having a separate workout for people who need some workouts to be easy on joints.,Good but not quite
1,2019-03-26 22:16:22,"I signed up for the 1-week premium free trial on Sunday March 24. I’ve been doing my workouts diligently and on schedule. I love the reminders and the overall accomplished feeling I get after completing a workout. Today, I was about to start my workout. I open the app, and it doesn’t recognize me at all. No data, no connecting my subscription. Starts me off at Day 1!! What a horrible way to derail my fitness goals when I was trying my hardest to start a routine. I should be starting Day 4 workouts today. Your tech glitch is more than an inconvenience, but a reason why I’ll be canceling any future subscriptions with you....way to go!",App Deleted History
1,2018-09-04 19:56:59,The exercises are ok and will continue to use them-since I had to purchase it.   My gripe is with the design and usability. No where in the app does it make it easy to cancel-instructions says in the account setting you would be able to turn off auto renewal but it does not have any option to do so. If you have to wait until 24 hrs to not renew-then you would be forced to pay for a subscription you didn’t intend to keep.   It’s frustrating to say the least. Perhaps it is a good app but the fact that I can’t cancel in a better way-makes me think this is a worthless app.,Canceling subscription is not intuitive
1,2018-03-01 15:16:48,"Not worth the price. Automatically charge $42 for a 6 month subscription after free trial without any notification. The only thing this app provides that free apps don’t is a meal plan. But the meal plans are weird (celery salad with chicken liver???) and ingredients often don’t match the recipe. The meal ideas could use a lot of help. Oh and the link they provide to get a refund doesn’t work. It was hard to figure out how to cancel the subscription.  Advice to company: if you’re going to automatically charge for subscription, at least set it to the monthly $10, instead of the 6 month $42 charge. People won’t be so mad.",Too expensive for what’s offered
5,2023-09-04 18:00:29,I’m a yoga teacher in an easy self starter and this gives me a variety and what I do. I get to follow along somebody else gets to teach me I get to do it whenever I want to and however long I want to it just works perfect for me. I’m 64 years old. I have a great figure I work out every day. I feel best when I work out every day this makes it easy.,Just right for me
1,2023-10-26 23:00:54,Can’t help but think they intentionally overcharged me/tricked me into purchasing more than clearly advertised. I have emailed twice about it and they are an absolute ghost town. Finally got an answer 2 MONTHS later and the customer service representative blatantly used the word “pop-up” when describing how I must have signed up for additional services without realizing. Seems like the are intentionally tricking people into extra services/costs then waiting so long to answer that you can’t get a refund or you give up and try to workouts anyway.,Terrible service. International harm.
1,2023-09-30 16:37:02,"While I was enjoying all the exercises and tools the app provided, their support and customer service is AWFUL!!! I lost access to my account. I had request a password reset but my email was not linked to an account. I’m not sure how that could be when I was being charged a subscription. None the less I emailed their support 3 times and have received ZERO follow up or communication. I pretty much spent the money for the subscription and wasn’t able to even use the app. Hopefully this reaches them and they’ll do something about their terrible costume service.",HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
5,2023-07-27 10:42:38,"I didn’t know what to expect at first. I was thinking how hard could this be, but I was wrong these simple movements can be a bit challenging.

5,2023-07-18 23:21:12,"I have been working out in the gym, lifting weights, and cardio for years. But never found anything to really resolve my stress and anxiety. This app was exactly what I needed.

I intend to keep this app even at the end of the 12 weeks.",Just what I needed.
1,2023-07-22 16:15:29,I came  across better me being advertised as a “somatic program” to release emotion and reduce stress. Come to find it’s just a weight loss app with a very generic “somatic” section. I reached out to the company immediately and only received template form responses with offers to extend my program. I’ve received three of these with no actual human contact and no acknowledgement of their being misleading. I’m a pilates and yoga teacher who specializes in nervous system regulation and somatic release. It looks like they’re just using buzz words to target customers with no ability to deliver on what they’re offering.,Sketchy and generic

The app doesn’t even save your foods that you logged the day before which is also difficult, because then you have to log it in again, the barcode scanner only snacks a few foods otherwise you have to put in all the info your self. Will not be using this app!!",Disappointed
4,2019-06-17 22:10:58,"I’m enjoying the app and especially like that the workouts switch up daily so you’re not doing the same moves everyday, with the exception being the 7-minute workout where the workouts stay consistent everyday.  The only reason I’m not giving this app 5 stars is because it does not write the data of calories burned to the Health App, only the workout minutes are recorded. It’d be nice for the developers to fix this with the next update.",Great app!
4,2019-05-01 17:08:22,I really love this app! It’s convenient and easy. I was always the one who didn’t know how to exercise my body and physical pain I have. This app is super easy to follow.. recipes are simple and exercises can be done in front room while you have children! The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the meals are all the same weekly. I don’t know if it’s because I’m still on the trial or if it’s just that way. Other than that I would say definitely 5 stars.,LOVE THIS APP
4,2019-04-20 17:14:37,"I really like this app. The exercises are great and I love the design. The only problem I have is with the meal plan aspect. There is no option to change meals which is a massive problem because there is also no option to list what I’m allergic to.

Don’t cancel your gym membership. Haha. The program wants you to be active enough to burn 790 calories a day but their workouts only burn like 40-60 calories. So this is not something you do instead of the gym. You still need the gym.   I was looking simply to change up my workout routine, but this was not for me. I only lasted a few days because the workouts felt more like just stretching and not working out at all.   Ok app if you’re looking for somewhere to track activities, food, water, etc but not as a workout plan.

This only allows you to get close to what you are actually doing. Counting my steps would be great if they allowed FITBIT to access my information. I don’t want to but a whole new watch when I have one. I will say one good thing is the exercise. They are nice and I like the how to videos.

I reached out to them the same day of the charge and they cancelled the subscription but kept my money and offered an additional 2 months free to reconsider.

You have to enter in the same calorie information every time for the same exact meals. You can’t manually enter your steps. NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. NO CONTACT INFORMATION.

1,2023-09-17 14:46:43,"It’s my first day and first exercise but I’m not impressed. It moves from one exercise to the next too quickly and it doesn’t explain what to do until you start doing it. There’s no time to figure out whether you’re positioned correctly or going the exercise correctly unless you stop the vid and read the instructions. I don’t see how the workouts can be effective if I have to keep stopping or if I have yo race to get in positron for the next exercise. I’m going to do a few more, but right now I feel like I just wasted 15 minutes of my life:",Not impressed
2,2023-08-24 19:06:06,"I was so excited to find this app from an instagram add. Unfortunately the videos they are selling to us depict only an extremely small portion of the offered workouts. For advanced wall Pilates workouts, there are only a handful and not enough variety to justify the subscription price. I had to do multiple workouts to feel I got a deep conditioning, and I was quickly bored with the lack of variety.  If you are a beginner looking to try new things and get fit, this may be for you.",Not as advertised
4,2023-07-14 04:56:17,"Updating my review because I’m warming up to the app. At first I was turned off by all of the upsell options that were promoting more weight loss. I did not ask for weight loss in my plan. However, after getting started with the workouts, I am really enjoying them. I’m glad I bought the 3 month plan because I definitely want to continue these workouts.",Good workouts

I have to go to the How To section a lot because the first video is not working. The “how to” i have to read and hope I understand it. It causes more time which then I can’t finish the program.

I pretty much purchased it to look through it then I deleted it and unsubscribe right away, and I’m still charged so I would like to get my money back.

2,2019-06-02 15:25:48,"I honestly really like this app and what it has to offer, what I don’t like is that it crams the subscription down your throat even though it says it offers a ‘ free ‘ meal plan and exercise plans. The meal plan was never free it keeps telling me to buy the subscription and only day 1 for the exercises is free. Probably should state instead of only saying ‘ free ‘. Really unfortunate too because I wanted to use this app it was really great the first day I used it. It’d be nice if they could offer something at least for people who don’t want a subscription or can’t afford it.",No thanks

That made me feel confident that I had successfully canceled, so I deleted the app and forgot all about it. I know that this sort of thing would normally be a billing issue on the apple iTunes side.

1,2023-09-20 21:23:53,"So I definitely should’ve looked into the reviews, They will over charge your phone/have hidden fees, And here is the kicker, They will ignore you when you try to get in contact with them. I just know they are hypocrites, for the fact that they would freak out and want answers if they where in our shoes. Shame to you and your families. Hope this message makes you feel some type of way and actually wanna fix the issue with not just me but everyone else complaining about the same issue.",Beware they are thieves
3,2023-08-19 03:17:20,"I love the features of the app and have raved to my friends and family about it. The disappointing part is that with the last update, it logged me out and I was unable to log back in by ANY means. I had only used a week of my 2nd paid month subscription.

Completely frustrating and I want a refund. What a waste of money.",Fraud
5,2023-06-22 01:27:44,I’ve been looking at this app for a while. I purchased it to do wall pilates. I had no idea it came with all the other programs I’ve been looking at like face yoga and hip hop dancing.  I rarely keep subscription services but there’s a ton of value in this one so I’ll likely keep it and use it every day.,"Easy to use, lots of workouts"
5,2023-02-14 09:56:17,Y’all I’m in love with this app I’m so happy that I seen this on ig I have no excuses now I can workout from home consistently. This was excellent and they put details on proper form it’s easy to determine how your form has to be for the work out thank you so much for making an excellent app. This is the type of motivation I needed I’m so happy ❤️,Brilliant
3,2023-04-18 23:21:38,"The whole idea of the app and the look are great. The execution is really lacking and has a lot to be desired.   The app itself runs very slow on my new phone over WiFi. Most workouts I attempt to start are very hit and miss if they even load. Most of the time I’m quitting the app and hoping it works when I restart it.   Again, very nice idea and layout. If they can work on the actual performance of the app I’d be great.",Nice Intentions
4,2021-08-05 13:21:40,"I wish it was more interactive like Noom, but you can’t beat the lifetime price of $28 for all these trackers and meals I never knew about. Tracking isn’t complicated at all.

Lifetime subscriptions are awesome.",Not interactive
1,2021-09-16 19:01:57,"The customer service for this app is absolutely horrifying. I am used to encountering poor customer service now and then; however, they have set a new standard. Ignoring concerns and patronizing are at the top of the list. When requesting a refund for unused subscription, I was given free months instead. Months of the service I disliked so much that I decided to stop it early. I essentially threw my money away with little to show for it.

However, once signing up for membership, I was very unimpressed with the overall quality of the product. While I tried working with it for a while, the poor user interface and lack of support quickly became more of a headache than help. When requesting a refund for the unused months of service, I was denied a refund and offered free months of membership instead. Not pleased.",Offered extra months instead of refund
4,2020-11-13 16:20:15,"If you learn the billing of this app; you will be fine.  The water tracker, calorie counter, exercise collection is awesome.  The best features that helped me: 1. Meal Prep I got introduced to many great low carb meal options. This is great. Don’t really care for all keto meal plan - asks me to eat salad every day :D  2. Intermittent fasting.  Game changer for me. I had heard of it but never been guided like this app helped me.  So great work on incorporating fasting into the plan.  I am still struggling to figure out to switch back to a non-keto meal plan.  I guess once u take the quiz and put your weight goals; the meal plan is it. No changing it.  I think customer service and billing can definitely be improved on BetterMe.  Otherwise I’m sticking to BetterMe and not moving to Noom.  Thanks, Sadfeen.",App has a good plan
3,2021-07-05 15:36:21,The food library is not even close to being as comprehensive as other apps I’ve used. I’d love to see it link to other apps like emeals or hello fresh where the information can be pulled in or at least loaded. My Fitness Pal had almost everything I tried to put in. This app has had virtually none of what I’ve tried to put in - or it has 15 choices for one thing - like cherries or blueberries. Needs some work.,Pretty good app but…
1,2021-03-05 17:55:34,"I usually don’t write reviews but my frustration with this app is so big that I have to. For the price you’re paying, the options are very limited. They sell in a way that the exercises and meal plans will work according to what your goals are, but that doesn’t work. Lots of simple exercises/meals and plans. It just get better if you go up to a plan where you have a coach. Also their fasting doesn’t let you edit if you type it wrong, so in case you’re not planning stop or start a fasting, be careful because it won’t count. Horrible experience.","Didn’t like it, waste of money."
1,2021-02-09 03:01:16,"I was looking for an app that could do it all, and this is not it. I am extremely disappointed.   Logging meals is impossible because of the entry methods, scanning a barcode is not useful because 90% of the scans I’ve done have not been there and I have to add them. If the barcodes were there, the information in them is highly inaccurate.   Exercises, even if you select the home version of exercises you have to own your own gym of equipment to do them.  The walking or movement exercises don’t work with Apple Watch even though you grant access to your movement information. You have to keep your phone in your pocket and can’t view your progress.   Meal Plans are laid out nicely but they are very odd items that I would never eat.    Anything extra like challenges cost way more than I paid for the app.   Major Disappointment for me.","Save your money, this app is not all it’s advertised to be."
1,2021-02-08 05:46:28,I purchased this a month ago. It’s a decent ap for $10. But I just found out I am getting charged $9.99/week!  I went back to App Store and it has various prices but never does it say a week. It says you can cancel through Apple ID subscriptions. I show no subscription for this app to cancel. I went in the app and found the cancel subscription option and it wants a password. I don’t have one and it offers me no way to email me a password change. I am furious. This app tells me to walk. I can set an alarm. I don’t need to pay $9.99 for this. Sorry!,$9.99 a week!!! Not one time purchase
5,2023-06-22 11:50:08,I workout each morning at a place that does circuit training and alternates between cardio and strength resistance training. These daily Wall Pilates  are a great way to get in a quick stretch and low impact training. I really enjoy the option at the end to do more of I feel up to it and have time.,Great Additional Workout
1,2020-11-10 11:14:59,"I decided to try this app due to the meal planning. However, the functionality is basic at best. The most input you can make is a quiz asking what foods you eat or don’t eat, then the offered meal plans completely ignore this input!!  This would be a minor inconvenience except that there is no way to edit the foods in the actual meal plans, or anyway to edit anything at all. So the meal planning is completely useless. This app has a ton of potential, but is horribly executed and seems the developers respond to purchasers feedback, but don’t ACTUALLY make any changes. Very disappointed.",Not as advertised
2,2020-09-15 16:12:01,"I wanted to like this app, the exercises were well organized. However the meals generated are way to out there, the menu it makes has you buying so many random ingredients. There should be a way to have it batch foods together so you can reuse ingredients weekly. But the killer that made me hate this was the search engine for tracking meals has no database practically. It only lets you enter food in ounces and can’t calculate calories for anything. I’m just sticking with my old meal tracking app. The subscription for this is too expensive.",Not worth it
4,2019-12-30 13:13:45,"Great customer service with this app. I changed devices and needed to update my subscription and they were very helpful. I am still new to the app but so far seems good. I like that you are able to see the exercises before you do them and something to tell me the water intake that is needed. Only reason for not 5 stars, the food part. I’m very picky so this will be hard for a picky eater like myself.",Great customer Service
1,2019-08-27 21:08:40,"I am so upset! I was forced to update to the new version and now I have no idea what I’m doing. It’s completely different. You can’t play music during your workout anymore. The animations are gone & now it’s videos of actual people showing you how to workout (eeeek!). Instead of grouping workouts by legs, arms, stomach, etc., now it’s a bunch of random workouts that I have no idea how to even follow, it’s so unorganized! Oh yeah, and the update lost ALL of my progress. Deleting my subscription ASAP & trying to remember off the top of my head what the old version had me doing. Super disappointed.",The new version is AWFUL
1,2023-09-12 11:37:41,I really like the free portion of the app so I paid for the subscription $29 for the year I didn’t think was that bad.

Found the correct email then tried to do the fast link to log in and I can’t anything to be sent to my email. I was really hopeful that this app would be good.

I think that a lot could be improved with this app, but mainly the calorie tracking section is totally inaccurate and makes manual tracking a pain.

5,2019-06-15 03:32:22,"So far I have liked the app. It shows how you need to do it and you can do the exercises at your own pace. After every exercise you get to have a 30 second rest.

I got a response on Dec 1st that it was a subscription and to send them a message anytime if I had questions. I sent another one back right away to cancel my subscription and to confirm when it has been canceled.  No reply! Sent an email. No reply! Checked my statement and they took the money out AGAIN!

The exercise videos are a plus. They are fairly easy to follow but the challenges are extra money so that is a definite turn off.   The logging of foods is ridiculous. The options are too many with differing values attached to them.  When logging weights in pounds, it is in whole numbers.  No allowing for tenths of a pound. So a loss of .8# will not register as a loss.  It made no sense to keep a separate log in my note app.  I emailed customer service-crickets.

1,2020-09-16 17:52:28,This is a lousy app!  It is limited and under performing. The app is basically a timer for your fasting window that only has a start button.  There is no option to plan ahead to have the timer start based on the time of day you want it to start.  A person has to remember to start the timer at the time you start fasting. There is no meal planning unless you PAY to ADD-ON a plan.  Even the feature to add your water consumption is lacking and limited as you are only able to add ounces but not subtract them if you make a mistake! Let me repeat... this is a really lousy app!,Sub par
2,2020-09-04 12:01:22,Great idea however LOTS of problems.  The calorie counter is off on many of the foods.  The fasting clock doesn’t always work. The pictures in some of the recipes are NOT for the recipe.  Pop up ads even with a 6 month subscription make an already tedious entry even Longer. Some of the recipes are very thrown together and un clear.  In the plus side I found a few new things to make and the exercise so far have been good. I think it’s a great concept but really needs a project manager to pull it together.,Needs work
3,2020-08-02 02:38:01,"I do love the concept, platform and meal tracker, BUT it’s “buggy.” I asked for workout reminders certain days of the week and then the app assigns those days as “rest days.” How does that make sense?   Also it offers you to PAY for challenges.... no money prizes just pay $10 to join the sugar free challenge. What blows my mind is that the app claims 4K people signed up for this. Uhhh you like this idea then just don’t consume sugar and keep your $10. 🤷‍♀️  There’s no way to log your own workouts if you don’t do the specific app workout. The weight tracker doesn’t “move” which for most who have a goal of weight loss... to see that line graph with a downward slope is super motivating.

The meal plans aren’t realistic and when you try to log what you actually ate, 9 times out of 10 I couldn’t find the brand of any of my items, making it very hard to actually track my calories.  3. Without realistic meal plans (which I actually needed) and mediocre exercises I can’t fathom paying this amount to track how much water I drink.   4. Although I clearly indicated a desire to gain weight, I was unable to adjust the number of calories that I needed to target each day as a 1300 calorie diet (which was suggested by the app) will not aid in weight gain. Lastly, all articles that I received were geared only towards weight loss, also not helpful for those that have other goals.",Terrible!

Update: I changed my rating to 3 stars because was Better Me refunded the subsequent $9.99 I was charged. I appreciate the quick resolution to my issue.,Scam alert. Updated
3,2020-10-29 07:08:32,Each workout pose should give users end signal. People usually not looking at the screen but the app changes the pose to another without any sound signal. How people know the pose has been changed? I think the app developers seem not test out by themselves.  Also the graph should be more accessible. Users just keep recording daily activities but the progress can’t be easily found.,Need improvement

1,2023-09-18 22:38:41,I signed up for the “free trial” which said I wouldn’t get charged until after ONE WEEK of using the app.  I injured my neck the day after signing up and cancelled. They proceeded to charge me anyways and then said I was basically not entitled to a refund without documentation that the plan didn’t work!  Couldn’t even really TRY it to begin with!  I’ve seen a lot of complaints with the same problem…buyer beware.  I’m contacting my credit card company and Apple.,Total scam
1,2023-09-06 22:29:03,I signed for this app with my Apple ID for the whole yearly membership. It was fantastic for like a month until the app signed me out and wouldn’t let me back in. I attempted to recover my account and it told me my account didn’t exist. I emailed support no less than 6 times over the course of a month with no reply. I finally had to contact apple to get my money back. If not for the horrendous service this would be a 5 star app.,"Great app, horrible service."

It was working really well but then all of a sudden my account got deleted after I paid my yearly subscription and when I tried to contact them weeks ago, they never got back to me so I feel like this app is some sort of scam and then I make a brand new account and then it deletes again!!! What is going on? Do better!!",This could’ve been a 5 star but…
1,2023-08-28 18:07:13,I used this app for only 3 days then I cancelled. Now after 3 months I saw a payment for $71 from the membership team!!! So I contacted customer support and I only receive automatic emails. No email saying that the membership was finally cancelled or that I was refunded for something that I didn’t use. I’m so upset with this app. I will definitely have to call the bank and ask to cancel all payments from Better me that it’s actually Worst Me!!,Only automatic emails!!!
1,2023-08-26 19:06:02,"The workouts have voiceover over prerecorded people doing the moves, so there’s no encouragement or additional context for the moves. The app is weird in that it counts down to each move with no context, and then when the actual timer starts for you to be doing the move, that’s when they start explaining what you should be doing. By the time they finish explaining what you’re supposed to be doing, the workout timer is nearly over.",Not great
1,2023-08-19 18:18:34,This app and company has been nothing but a hassle and steeling money.

2,2023-07-18 15:10:38,Overall a good polished app but could and should be improved.  1. iPhone and iPad instance of the app don’t seem to synchronize and share data. A workout on one is not reflected on the other.  2. No Apple Watch integration. Can pause the app via the watch or track workout in Fitness app.  3. Workouts done on the iPad aren’t reflected in the iOS activity tracker thus no exercise ring movement 4. Can’t keep the app in full screen while on the iPad in landscape mode (only videos can be made full screen 5. Training videos are often too short. Need to be able to set time manually  6. Exercise explanation should happen BEFORE the exercise timer starts.,Lots of improvements needed

If you were to follow the plan you would need to have a personal chef or no job. The amount of time it would take to cook and shop for the groceries left me feeling scammed.

5,2022-08-07 21:09:49,I am 68 years old and a Great Grandma. I have hardware in my back and need to get back in shape to live a long life for my Grand. I need to loose belly fat and get flexible. The chair yoga felt so good and I will challenge myself to keep going.  Kristie,Older getting better
5,2021-12-27 01:50:29,I know what I eat and am more then fine changing my entire diet for me to be healthier I wish it gave me suggested on what to eat idk maybe it does if you pay the 20$ per year,Love this app just one thing…..
5,2021-06-18 10:10:19,"Nice app with good content library and many useful features for daily basis, but meals planning is a bit complicated for me.  Please keep going improving the app",Multiple features with good potential
5,2020-03-03 19:48:48,I like that you can push to further exercises when you are ready to move to the next one. And not try to play catch up. And so you end missing steps this is a really good app! I live it!,Just right!
1,2021-05-01 00:14:38,"Tried the free seemed good.  I liked the notifications, so I upgraded.  This basic upgraded barely offered any more content. What it did was open up to a bunch more upgrade options; workout routines, meal plans etc.  such a joke.   15 minutes after the upgrade - major buyers remorse.   Just canceled subscription renewal so it didn’t accidentally renew in a year.  Worst app purchase I’ve ever made.",Upgrade opens to more upgrades
1,2021-02-26 03:26:15,"Customer service is non-existent. I came across this app on FB (that was my 1st clue) but I took the bait. Their marketing stated I would have a personal plan in 2hrs based on algorithms in their software, their email to me stated 48hrs. I requested a program of only weight machines; no free weights, instead I got a whole bunch of weight lifting programs which none met what I asked for.  I sent CSR an email and got another auto-reply stating 48hrs for a response at that point canceling was too easy.",Customer Service
1,2021-02-22 15:06:17,It ends up being equivalent (if not more) than a real gym membership without the perks of using any workout machines or sauna. Workouts are good but you can also find similar workouts for free online. Once you start fasting for a few days the timer then becomes useless. I thought it was a one time purchase but was charged once a week and I don’t feel I was getting more than any other free workout online.,Overpriced and charged weekly NOT once
1,2020-12-08 17:52:30,"The app is horrible! I tried to unsubscribe, I couldn’t. It kept redirecting me to the subscription renewal page! I tried to message them.

I found the area to reset this in options and change it but the meals won’t reset to this new plan. Also, I have a Fitbit and there is no way to connect it or add the steps manually.

Hope they will refund my money.",Don’t recommend
1,2020-09-22 11:21:21,"Great app, but definitely some big bugs!  Only been using the app for a few days paid $30 for a subscription and it seems to be a great!  However, the app only gave me 3 days, when the subscription guaranteed me 3 months! What’s up with that?  Reached out to support, but so far has felt pretty neglectful.  I’m hoping something will magically happen, and I’ll just be able to take or change this review, but right now, I’m feeling like I paid high price for a subscription to an app and they put me on a free version.... then gave me no response.  Not mad yet, seems to be a great app! But it can be frustrating to pay for something that you can’t use, might be a waste of money. I’m hoping it’s not.","Great app, but definitely some big bugs!"
3,2020-09-02 13:10:14,I love everything about the app except that the workout has no vocals. I will be doing the workouts and the workout changes and I have no idea.  I can’t always keep my eyes on the screen while working out. There needs to be something that tells you they are changing from one motion to another.,Really wish
5,2019-09-05 02:17:45,"I love this app you see it working it’s perfect but I don’t like the new update I like the old one bc u could just get done on ur own time,it’s not rushing u. An you took off the young face ... other than that I told everyone about this app",Can u go back
4,2020-01-24 15:44:26,App will not open to personalize the plan for workouts and food. I can see the different workouts and enter weight and goal weight other than that app is useless. Wish I hadn’t wasted $30. After paying $30 for year access it expired in 7 days. What a waste!,Waste of money

1,2019-08-29 03:32:50,I really liked this app until the last update. I have not been able to use the app for some reason it says it can not connect to the internet. I have reset my phone turned on and off the WiFi at home work my sister and my mothers homes.  I have reached out twice to support and have heard nothing.  I wouldn’t mind if the app was free however I paid to use it and it’s very frustrating to not be able to use it.,App not working.
1,2019-08-13 15:55:03,Piece of crap app and their SCAMMERS 9/10 when I look at reviews I look at the lowest views cause their views are more realistic to me I only checked it out to see if the low reviewers were telling the TRUTH and sure in hell they were they will ROB you for your money if you’re paying $120 why do y’all want us to pay even more money a real gym isn’t that much for ONE person greed at its finest their worst than a pimp if you don’t give them what they want they’ll for sure TAKE IT,Fake good reviews
1,2019-07-25 18:18:04,It is soo dumb do you to make people have to pay to finish your workout like why would we pay money to workout at home? When people want to be healthy and do what’s good for their body you should let them!! Don’t make them pay for something when they could go to the gym and workout out for less... ads would be better than you making people pay.. just saying,Why should we have to pay for wanting to be healthy?
5,2019-07-01 05:32:18,I love this app SO much it is the best thing that has ever happened to me it is just so good quality and it works really good I went from a blob of fat to a skinny woman but buff it is truest amazing thank y’all who made this it is a true blessing from god it turned my life around!💪😁,Amazing app
5,2019-06-11 16:43:57,"This app is great and I like how cheap it is to get absolutely no adds free and I like how it constantly reminds me to eat healthy drink water or do my workout and I like how cautious it is with underaged users and how you can’t lose more that 80 pounds.   Cautious,safe,and effective",This app is awesome
1,2019-06-30 05:29:57,I like the workouts then I try to work for the second day and I can’t because I have to pay $119 really. I deleted this app because of the price if it was free why did you put a price on it to continue the app. I really wanted to keep it but I’m not paying that much money. My friend even deleted it because of the price. I really am disappointed 😔 in this app. And if you pay to do the exercises then mine as well put a price on it to be $119 to get it.,Really 😞😞😞😞😞
1,2019-06-23 17:20:17,"The app is great. It makes me want to get up and move around. But, the problem is, you have to pay to do the workouts. This is not the gym, it is an app for your phone. They put random things for your food choices. And also, the “model” doesn’t help at all. It shows an example, and makes it seem super easy, when sometimes it’s not. Maybe to get more business, make it an option to pay or not to pay for the workout.",App
1,2019-06-20 19:18:14,"I was playing my phone this morning, better me just jumped out and got my attention. I downloaded and installed without seeing charge information. Right after I installed, apple sent me a bill. So I immediately cancel the subscription and deleted the app from my phone. I tried to contact apple store to get refund, citing the facts, it said I do not need the refund criteria. I have called my credit card company to refuse pay this bill. What a scam! Be aware!!!",This is a scam
5,2018-06-28 17:31:15,"I absolutely LOVED the workouts for every trouble spot-I absolutely noticed differences!!! The recipes consisted of food that wasn’t exactly easy to acquire, so I told the app that I preferred vegetarian meals, and it made them much more easy to make and find lying around the house.

Deleting the app doesn’t cancel your subscription, you must cancel it through apple. Well, that’s fine but I cannot figure out how to do that and can’t find any solutions on how to do that.

I feel like I’m about to get screwed into a recurring membership I can’t get out of 😡 Any help??",Not sure about it yet...

But, I am not allowed to log in. I’ve tried to reset password and even emailed “customer service.” There was an automated response to my email that didn’t come close to resetting my account. It’s straight trash. Workouts are probably good. But it’s a ripoff",Stole Money!
1,2023-02-16 02:50:31,The wall Pilates workouts have the poorest quality of anything I have seen since apps were invented. The music is like bad carnival music played on a tin record player from 1920. The voice over instructions are obviously translated and have that robot vocal quality that is not motivating or relaxing. The instructions are poor also. It’s just bad all the way around. Do not purchase.,Terrible production quality
5,2021-07-16 00:27:13,This app gives me so much encouragement I could do it for life the workouts work you out till u need a good night rest is what it supposed too so I asked and it delivered period,I feel blessed and I’m obsessed!!
5,2020-04-30 07:34:01,the only thing I think it should have is a favorite section to see what training plan you have started in a list,A little must have
1,2021-01-07 05:50:38,"This app was amazing at first, I liked that I could track my calorie intake and that it had specific workouts for me to do.

I don’t not know what happened, maybe it was a free trial sort of thing but i never saw anything about that so I’m genuinely confused.",Being charged for nothing

I’m super frustrated and feel like I waisted my money. I would love a refund but I can’t get a hold of anyone and it’s not a subscription. I guess I just purchased a 28 day plan. This app is NOT what I expected at all. MyFitnessPal is a way better food tracker and the meal plan is not as easy as they made it seem it would be.",Frustrating!
5,2020-02-23 19:54:33,Instead of paying a gym membership where I know I’m not going to go because of my anxiety. This is a much better alternative! Especially since I’m a new mom and can use this to work out at home!,Totally worth it!
5,2019-08-08 11:40:40,I love how it helps your body in just a few day. The variety of exercises in just a few minutes can help how your body looks. I also love this app for the way it helps your nutrition and how to take care for your body. :),Awesome App
1,2020-01-24 12:06:12,Your account is charged immediately for the full year. It says feee trial and it’s not. I checked my account within minutes of adding the app and noticed I was charged for the full year. I cancelled subscription as well as the app and typically if it’s a free trial the money won’t post. However I did and I have contacted them and was basically told OH WELL!!! They obviously don’t know the definition of free trial!!! Horrible business practice and for this reason I don’t recommend!!!!!!!,DO NOT BELIEVE ITS A FREE TRIAL
3,2020-01-24 05:29:01,it asked me what my current is and my goal i set to being 20 extra pounds and it only gave me the option to find out how much i want to lose. i was hoping it would give me workouts to build weight healthily and meals to eat for extra protein and lean fats and carbs but i don’t think it does . i’m kinda disappointed..,No option for weight GAINERS
1,2019-08-29 12:05:46,"Last night I downloaded this app despite problems in the past. It seemed to have been update and reviews looked pretty positive. Right away there was a screen that I had to click that I wanted to join for $9.99 a month even to view anything. $9.99 I can do, cause I figured “hey if I don’t like it...

People shouldn’t have to and I’m leaving it at that!",Great First Day! But Money!!!
5,2019-07-01 12:26:57,I love the ease of the exercises. I would love to keep it but will never use the diet suggestions it comes with. This should be an option upgrade with the exercises as a lite option.,Great App but needs modified for just exercise option

I tried to cancel day one after accepting the trial that states “cancel anytime” but couldn’t find a way I’ve tried to find a way to contact the manufacturer and haven’t had any success.

1,2019-05-19 22:16:17,Be very careful what you click!  You are led to believe there is a 7 day free trial but the default subscription is for one year pre-paid.  If you click subscribe with the default button highlighted you will instantly be charged for a full year.  There is no recourse with these people.  If you actually get someone to respond their answer is that it’s not their problem.  The app is mediocre at best but the customer service is terrible.  Don’t waste your money!,Be careful!
2,2019-04-11 14:18:15,"Make sure you read the details of this app. I thought I was doing a free trial but it makes you pick a payment option and now there’s $131 pending charge to my card! The app also makes it look like it’s a monthly fee of $10/month but they clearly charge you upfront. Again, just read the details closer than I did.   I’m reaching out to the company to cancel these charges. TBD",Read the details.
4,2019-03-13 10:51:53,After we have paid for a subscription do we get to have access to the workouts after the subscription ends? This is important to me because I’ve paid for them so I think I should still have access to them.,I like the app but

For $20 plus a month someone should respond. With so many apps like this out there customer service is king. I guess they have enough suckers out there excepting second rate service. I’m not one of them. I like to get my money’s worth.,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE
2,2023-05-14 14:16:11,This is nearly false advertising. They claim to provide you a personalized walking plan.

Calorie tracking lacks different units, or a wide selection of foods, workouts don’t account for available equipment or muscular focus, and fasting doesn’t allow you to adjust start and end times after you’ve begun.  Additionally, the app has a huge focus on monetization. They try to trick you in to a three month subscription out of the gate, and then try to get further up charges with “challenges” in the app.  You are better off downloading three separate apps to get a better version of what is being offered here.","Lots of UI, Not A Lot Of Substance"

2,2019-04-11 17:57:53,I love this app however every single time I log in I have to completely set it up again. Then when I restore purchase all of my data has been deleted. It’s more work to use the app than it is to get into shape. When this glitch is fixed I’ll come back but until then I’ll have to find another app.,Glitches
3,2019-04-05 15:52:57,I signed up for the 7day free trial to access what this app was all about. Decided it wasn’t for me and there is no way to cancel it like they say.  I ended up emails the support team and am awaiting to hear from them. I will be so angry if I get charged for this when I’ve tried desperately to cancel it.,Can’t cancel trial in the app.
1,2019-03-24 22:11:15,"I got charged even when I believed I had canceled my subscription. I would really like my 10 dollars back. The instructions on how to cancel a subscription was not clear and if you press the stop collecting data button for me made it seem as if that canceled the subscription since when I went back onto the app, the options of purchasing a subscription was there....",Subscription

Today 1/17, they charge me (I’m still in my free week), and when I go into the app to use it (now that they have charged me for it), it doesn’t allow me to see anything unless I login through Facebook. I absolutely don’t want to do that..",Frustrating
1,2019-01-09 22:01:14,I tried the 7 day free trial with today being my 5th day and It wasn't what I expected so I am looking to cancel my trial before i get charged for something i do not intend on using. Well there is NO option any where on the app to cancel or here on the App Store. I email the app with the email address provided on here and it says that email does not exist. Cancellation should be as easy as signing up. Not cool,No cancellation options
1,2018-10-02 13:07:55,"I would give zero stars if I could. I wanted to try the app out one time without paying for premium. I was automatically charged and i messaged support to help me out 3 times before they got back to me months later and said they canceled my account. Fast forward 6 months, I found out my account was never cancelled and I’ve been charged $10 every month since trying the app one time.",SCAM
1,2018-09-16 11:05:30,I downloaded this app a week ago and realized I wasn’t in the position to fully use this app at this time so I canceled the subscription 2 days ago yet it still charged me as if I hadn’t. I would’ve used this app later on when school and work died down and paid for the subscription then but this experience may have swayed me away from that. I just want my money back is all.,Took my money
3,2018-09-09 19:46:47,"Love that the workouts show you how to do each exercise. Would like to be able to do more than 1 set though, we should have the option to replay it or select how many sets we want to do.   Also, for the diet portion there should be a low carb or Keto option.","Love, but needs work"
1,2018-07-19 02:18:43,When I got the app I got a notification pop up that had said it would charge my card the 6th which was more then 3 days before charge. The next day the app charged my account. I emailed the email provided for help more then 5 weeks ago. Still have not heard from anyone about getting my money back or at least an explanation to why it would say I have 3 days but give me one.,Bad review
2,2023-10-06 13:51:32,This app is a money grab with no one to talk to when things go wrong. I’ve been waiting for weeks now for a response to how all my data was deleted. No response but they they dinged me twice for the subscription cost. What gives.,"No response, loses data , charged me twice"
1,2023-10-04 12:30:33,"I cancelled my subscription and they still charged me $22. I asked for them to do something about it and received one response claiming they couldn’t find my account.

What a pain. rip off artists!",HORRIBLE AND USELESS
3,2023-07-31 13:32:07,I bought this program but was unhappy to find that I was charged a transaction fee to download it. I don’t like when a company isn’t upfront about charges like this.   I’m not sure I’ll continue with it.,Beware of Transaction Charge
1,2023-06-04 15:55:04,You had one job.   I took the quiz and paid for this. Where is Pilates? Or the wall posture Pilates workout I paid for?  I don’t care about dieting and the habit tracking. Sure it’s useful but that’s not what I paid for. I cannot find it. I see around 6 workouts but I’m not here to workout my bum. I wanted the posture workout.,Where is Pilates? Or the wall posture workout I paid for?

Maybe this bad review will get me some help?,Disappointed
1,2023-01-18 15:06:58,"This is the worst app, it uses AI figures and the videos loop in countdowns and only sometimes show what the exercise is with talking so you don't know what you are supposed to be doing.

1,2021-07-26 19:48:33,Updating my original review  While I opted not to continue using this app after the fixes technical support suggested didn’t resolve my issues.   I do appreciate however that after unsuccessfully attempting to solve my issues the company did accept I was not satisfied and stayed true to their satisfaction guarantee and refunded my initial 3-month membership purchase,EDITED: Not for me

This is not the program or meal plan for me.",Dissatisfied and would like a refund
1,2020-09-16 11:44:09,"This app is a complete scam. I signed up for a 1$ trial through Facebook and was supposed to get a personalized meal/fasting plan but it turned out to be just a calorie tracker. There are free apps that do that!   When I realized I wasn’t getting what I paid for, I immediately tried to cancel the trial, the same day, and the only way to do so is via email. THEY NEVER ANSWERED MY EMAIL, never canceled my “subscription” and continued to charge me. I had to contact my bank to dispute the charges.   I suspect they will charge me again and at that point I’ll have to cancel my card.   Look at the Facebook and Instagram reviews! They are FULL of people having the same issue as me.   This is a SCAM!

1,2018-05-23 13:13:45,Automatically charges $40 for. 6 month subscription. The app says you just cancel it on the app but it is not true no where on the app can you cancel even the 7 day trial. Spent 30 mins trying to cancel on your app and ended up having to go through my email to do so. Not worth the money you only burn about 200 calories in doing all of he workouts available.,Not worth it

1,2022-05-09 00:44:11,"I re-checked the agreement and there was no mention of additional payments apart from subscription. Therefore I have a question, why does this fitness app charge me?

I had to push them to even get one week of charges removed and they acted like they were doing me a favor refunding that.

I also can’t unsubscribe either and I’m freaking out that I have to pay that much money.,I can’t unsubscribe

The app is expensive compared to other apps that offer more and have a lot less bugs.  4. Other apps allow you to scan food that you eat and automatically import them into your calorie tracking.

3,2023-06-06 08:11:15,Trying to do the workouts and the person is not following the instructions in the different sets.,Just starting and a little disappointed.
1,2023-04-25 15:48:04,Not anything like advertised. Video doesn’t match the audio. Confusing to navigate the program. Tried to get a refund after trying day 1 of the program and they don’t allow refunds. Save your money. There are much better apps out there.,Horrible App - audio doesn’t match the video

1,2021-05-17 16:10:41,"Was really enjoying this app until it deleted all my info with no way of getting it back. The other reviews are pretty spot on about how the idea of this app is great but it just doesn’t work.

Not worth it,Charges you up the wazoo

Additionally, they charge you $9.99 EVERY WEEK! That’s insane for an app…",RIP OFF! BUYER BEWARE!!
1,2020-12-15 23:51:26,"I found this app to be a bit frustrating. Perhaps it is where I’m at in life but despite this, I canceled my subscription early on and have yet to receive a refund!

Just got charged today for the app. Beyond frustrated.,No reply still 10 days later

1,2020-08-14 12:43:10,I don’t really like this app you pay for your subscription for three months then you have to pay for premium then you have to pay for challenges 😢 it becomes extremely expensive. In top of that it doesn’t correctly count your steps and you can’t manually input your steps in.,Won’t calculate my steps correctly
1,2020-06-26 03:50:20,After 24 hours of having this app I knew it wasn’t for me. Nothing was detailed with the foods I do and don’t like. And I never received an email as promised . So I tried to cancel before trial is over. Today is day 3 and I can find out how to cancel.  There’s no  membership login. This app is trash. It’s not American based which is probably the reason it’s so differcult to cancel. This app is TRASH.,Trash

I don’t want to eat any of the programmed meals(this would be a nice suggestion), not the best way to track calories.

1,2019-10-31 11:40:20,I saw an ad for this app on instagram. Once the app was opened it advertised to me that it would be 0.99 cents for a yearly subscription instead of $50!! So of course I purchased that!! Turns out I ended up paying the full $50 It was so unclear to me what the green shaking 0.99 cents meant and I feel manipulated and I really don’t have that money and Apple wouldn’t let me refund it. I am crushed.,READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE IN APP
3,2019-10-01 02:29:27,"I don’t know how, but I downloaded this app for free and was charged a yearly subscription (not less) to my surprise. It might be me being thick, but in my view i was not made aware of having to pay or when i am to be charged",Was not aware of subscription policy

3,2019-07-18 16:26:16,it is a great app. i am a teenager and way over weight. The first workout wasn’t as hard so i wasn’t really out of breath so i did it again. however i wish you could still get the trainers without having to pay. but overall great app,It’s a mid good app
4,2019-06-28 16:42:43,I like it it’s just that I do not like apps when you have to pay like monthly or yearly it’s just a big waste of money and I just want to get fit I mean what does money have to do with it I don’t understand!,BetterMe Review

1,2019-04-02 20:29:53,This app charges you 9.99 A WEEK - that’s more than my gym membership which is only 30$ a month. In addition they make it incredibly difficult to cancel the subscription and when I reached out they told me I had to figure it out on my own through the app store. Absolutely absurd and not even that great of workouts. They supply you with 4 exercises which is barely a workout. DONT FALL FOR THEIR SCAM!!!,SCAM
1,2019-04-02 03:39:15,"Why make someone go through the BS of adding height, weight, etc and agreeing to terms and conditions, then suddenly BAM! Pay me! There is a reason the App Store shows a price on the app before it can be installed.  I was hoping this one was different but I’m not willing to pay for it first just to find out. It’s the same as every other weight loss app out there.","Same same, but add $120!"
1,2019-02-19 17:59:14,So I downloaded this app and created an account with gmail and started my free trial. I decided to cancel as i havent been using but when i went into the app it had signed me out and now when i press sign in the only available option is to sign in with Facebook?

1,2021-05-14 04:11:59,Don’t expect much from this. It says “personalized plan for you” and it’s definitely not personalized. It doesn’t change your workouts you have to pick them yourself. Not to mention half the workouts are identical but just have different names. Don’t get conned into this app. Absolute joke.,Absolute joke of a workout app

1,2019-01-22 10:40:06,I do not like the fact that you cannot manage the subscription from the app. Seems misleading to get you to commit when you download for a free trial but no easy way to cancel before being charged a subscription fee. No customer service contact or anything. Seems like a great concept for an app but for me integrity is key. Thumbs down for me 👎,Subscription Misleading

1,2023-03-09 03:26:17,I’ve been struggling a lot with losing weight and this app has helped me better myself more than any gym trainer or anything had done before.

3,2018-04-12 14:40:59,The diet aspect is neat. The app gives you a full outline of what to eat for the day. It would be better if there was a weekly grocery list option though. It’s difficult to go through each day individually and compile the needed groceries for the meals.,Diet

2,2023-02-08 17:32:27,I was hoping that the exercises would be General total body exercises gradually increasing in repetition and difficulty. I don’t want to focus on my arms for four days. When I go to the extra workouts they are too difficult for a senior.,Senior exercise

1,2023-01-25 18:32:37,I am very disappointed with this app and the program. I was under the impression that it was chair yoga for seniors. I am sorry to say that I can’t do half of what is expected and it is very discouraging. I will not be able to continue and I am sorry that I wasted my money on this!!!

1,2022-05-09 17:34:36,I was frustrated when I found out that their customer support is out of touch. What if the clients are going through some urgent issue and they need help?

1,2021-02-10 05:58:50,Advertisements for the app within instagram fail to mention it’s a subscription based app. Subscription only lasts 7 days. If it was mentioned it had to be somewhere in fine print. Either way 1 star for transparency - the app itself isn’t that bad but it’s mediocre at best.,Sneaky advertisement
1,2021-01-24 13:39:29,"This app is a black hole! There’s no way to cancel yourself. They make you contact customer support, who never actually cancels the membership.

1,2021-01-04 21:07:53,Downloaded app from website info. They kept up selling more subscriptions even when I asked to cancel then texted it was a weekly subscription and charged all over again.  Could not get the app or web site to do anything.  Pay pal has not bee much help yet.,Tried to cancel
1,2020-12-05 01:27:41,I can’t find anyone to help me cancel my subscription. Not responding to my messages and emails. Not in my apple subscription list so not sure how to cancel.

1,2019-03-18 03:30:04,"I was excited to have an app prompt me to workout. After reading the directions for just a few of the exercises, it was clear that they were not written in English and the translations were not only unclear but were dangerous. The language in the articles demonstrates a philosophy of fitness that smells of sexism. I’m a woman, not “a girl”.",Dangerous to body and mind
1,2019-02-20 23:30:55,How do you cancel subscription. I had a free trial for one day and I want to cancel it. I didn’t make an account or anything I just don’t like it and don’t want to pay after the free trial. It doesn’t say how you can cancel it. It says that it will just assume you want to pay after the free trial and I don’t want to be charged for anything.,How to cancel
1,2019-02-08 20:26:16,"Basically the same exercise every day and you can find the same moves online for free or at least something similar.

1,2019-01-16 11:56:00,They said it would be easy to cancel and I can not figure out how to cancel this App. I tried to cancel before my trial was up because I thought this app did more than it actually does. I can not figure out how to cancel it and now they have charged my card. Very unhappy and STILL can not figure out how to cancel.,Cancel
1,2019-01-12 15:49:57,I downloaded your app last night just take a look and picked the seven day free trial. After about a half hour of looking I realized this is not what I was genuinely looking for so I canceled my “free trial” but this morning I noticed you guys charged me 53 dollars. I am super upset because although t seems like a great app it’s just not what I was looking for. Please help,Seven day free trial?
1,2019-01-11 00:48:18,So I was really excited to I talked this app. Then I was disappointed first I can only choose one goal. Then it had food options but no choice for vegan. The have vegetarian but not vegan they are not the same thing like at all. If your gonna have a food preference you need to make sure to include every food preference not just 3.,No vegan option
1,2018-12-27 18:22:15,I wanted a one month try and it app ended up charging me more than they should.  The system only set up to purchase a one month for 9.99 and when you want to get started it will not let you because they want you to purchase 6 month or more.  This is a scam and I want my money back.,Want my money back

1,2018-08-25 12:15:52,I have looked through the terms document and I have even emailed the support team but I do not see the way to cancel this app so I was charged when I want to cancel. This will continue to happen because I cannot figure out how to cancel and no one will answer my emails. DO NOT TRY THE TRIAL!,Can not find how to cancel so I am being charged!!!
1,2018-07-20 03:35:31,I paid 60 dollars thinking I’d have very specialized workouts and meal plans. Definitely not what you get. The information provided is basic exercises you could get from free apps and the app just lists off recipes you could find on the internet. It would be super cool if I could get my money back but I doubt it. Just not for me,Regret
4,2018-03-19 07:10:11,This app is really cool to tone parts of body you like. They also have a vegan mean plan option. The recipes are a little funky at time but it’s helpful for ideas.,Great Home Workouts!

1,2023-07-19 10:57:00,From ground to standing from ground to standing from ground or standing it’s ridiculous. They can’t do everything down the floor first and everything standing second you take too much time going up and down up and down.,Up down up down

1,2019-06-16 22:37:10,The app was deleted off my phone before my trial was even over. That was months ago. I’m still being charged on my card and I haven’t been able to find someone to talk to about this. I’m not okay with paying for an app that I’m not even using.,Not happy

1,2019-06-08 19:29:58,I was charged for this even though I refused to use after I denied the initially security settings that you have to agree to before even having access to the content. I would like a refund but see no other place to contact the app.,Charged for app

1,2019-02-16 16:24:33,I was ready to start my workout journey and the first day the workouts were great. I felt better. Then the second day I clicked my workout to start AND IT WAS A TOTAL RIP OFF!! U had to pay money. Umm no thank u. It made me sooo mad!! Who needs to pay to do workouts. I sure ain’t. I would not recommend this app. RIP OFF!!!!!,It costs money!! No!!

1,2018-05-25 11:48:24,"This app is great, except for the fact that you can only do the first workout and in order to do anymore you have to pay a monthly subscription. I just wanted to be able to use an app for once without being sucked in to paying.",Costly
3,2018-05-20 22:15:31,The workout portion is really good. It does a great job of demonstrating how to do each move and providing timers. The food suggestions seem very limited and I personally think most sound gross. Chicken livers? 🤮,Good work outs

1,2018-04-03 04:00:42,"First of all, I do not like downloading an app that claims to be “free” only to discover that it just has a one week free trial and will automatically renew at a ridiculously expensive rate if not canceled before the end of the week.    Besides that, the recipes sound horrible- what is their obsession with chicken livers? The recipes don’t seem to always match up with the title.   Sloppy work for something so pricey.  I canceled the subscription the first day and will delete it. Lose It is a much better app for a better price.","Horrible menus, not worth the price"
3,2018-03-13 17:27:48,"I give it 3 stars because yes it is a great app, but I believe the cost is so high. It should be free, people shouldn’t have to pay to stay fit... especially working out, overall it’s a great app !",Why?
2,2018-01-04 03:19:23,"Paid for the app, used it for 2 days, and liked it. However, the app no longer works, after I’ve paid for it. I can’t get into the workout part of the app without an “error”. It’s ridiculous !!",Irritated

1,2023-02-06 22:49:56,This app does not let you choose workouts you want to use based on your needs.  Saw a workout by them on FB but it was not available when I purchased the plan.  Sorry I wasted my money.,One of the worst fitnesss

1,2022-03-28 17:08:32,No unsubscribe where they tell me.  Still getting emails even though I deleted the app.  Everything behind the paywall so you get no trial.

1,2020-12-05 03:00:41,Total rip off. I was told I would get a personalized fasting program. I got a menu for a diet. I emailed and asked for the program I was promised with no response.   The other problem is the food tracking program is horrible. I scanned several foods and they wouldn’t scan. DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY.,Rip Off

1,2020-08-24 17:52:38,I saw an ad for information about fasting on Facebook and it looked promising. I decided to try it since it died state there is a 30 day guarantee. When I then downloaded the app and quickly changed my mind to cancel and get a full refund they could only give me 50%,Total BS

3,2019-03-09 16:09:27,Ok loving the first 4 minute workout and all but my progress won’t save. Every time I go to save and continue the app closes and the exercise is not logged.,Just started
2,2019-02-13 12:55:03,Be careful when downloading. Once you start the free trial there’s a $9.99 automatic weekly fee if you don’t cancel it. This could be a very costly mistake if you aren’t reading carefully. May be a good app but could end up costing more than a monthly gym membership.,Not a free app
1,2019-02-10 15:56:31,I signed up for the 7 day free trial so I could see if this app was a good fit for me prior to making a commitment to purchase.  The app states to go to Account Settings to cancel but there is NOT an option to cancel.   Are you purposely misleading consumers or am I just missing something????,There’s no option to cancel!
1,2019-01-19 06:39:16,You know you should write in the description that if you cant pay for it it’s basically a demo for one day and thats it so people wouldnt waste their data on downloading this tbh the apps design is actually good and guess it might be good for people who CAN pay,Not good for who cant pay for it
1,2018-12-08 17:02:40,There’s no way to cancel a subscription! And no way to contact anyone... this app is a joke and you should never download it. I still want to cancel and get a refund since I didn’t even use it and it forced me into a premium subscription........ someone better contact me.,Worst app ever

3,2018-08-12 13:50:00,I like the app and I felt tricked into a 6 month automatic sign up following the free trial. I never had an option of choosing a time frame. I just got billed for $41 for a 6 Month subscription.,Deceptive sign up

1,2018-07-26 03:03:31,I downloaded the app trying to see which FREE workout app I wanted to try out and not even two days later I see they took money out of my account and I never even approved this transaction. Only gave it one star because I couldn’t give it zero.,Do not purchase

1,2018-04-24 23:26:41,I want to cancel during the trial period and there are no obvious options - clearly they’re trying to take your money and hope you forget about the auto renew - do not download this app - you can research workouts online and not be scammed!,You can’t cancel - it’s a rip off

3,2023-05-01 16:15:59,So far so good. Just trying to get used to using the app.,Would give 5 stars but still learning
1,2023-04-24 10:20:45,My first workout after allowing the app to access most all my metrics and at the end of the 16 min morning walk it showed I walked .02 mi. Meanwhile I was on a treadmill the entire time and had completed 2.5 mi.  So far not very impressed.,No watch data

5,2021-07-28 12:41:55,"As someone who works in an office all day, and doesn’t have a ton of time to spend at a gym, I needed something that would put together well designed workouts for me, and that would give me a workout schedule aimed at achieving results.  BetterMe nailed it!  I have been using the app for about 5 months, and I have lost 20lbs and gained  a ton of strength and definition.  I was a college athlete, and at 52 yrs old, I now have almost the physique that I had in college.   The workouts are clear and easy to follow, without a lot of extra “chatter” (which I don’t need or want).  The app allows you to set your specific goals, and provides a lot o flexibility to do more or less on any given day, by supplementing the workout that the app selects with additional exercises of your choosing.   In addition, I got a lot out of the intermittent fasting program, and the food tracker, which allowed me to “reset” my relationship with food.  This was a surprise to me, as I did not expect to use these tools.  Generally, I don’t need to use those functions anymore (other than very sporadically), but they were essential to getting me into good routines and habits. (I am a good cook and generally understand nutrition, so I did not use the meal plan function, but it could provide helpful direction to some).   I cannot recommend this app more highly.  It might not be for everyone, but if what you need is some structure, a schedule, and straightforward workout routines handed to you on a platter, this fits the bill.  And it produces results!",This is a great App!!

4,2021-09-18 14:44:27,"I want to rate 5 star but for having to pay for the app I expect less technical issues. I’ll be on track for trophies and proud of my consistency then the app won’t load or needs to logged out/back in. When that happens I loose my streaks and trophies which motivate me. I have to start meditation and reading back from day 1. The longest streak I’ve had was 15 days then I had to uninstall and reinstall again putting me back at day 1. I’ve only had the app 28 days but have had this happen 4x already. But I’m trying to stay motivated even though I have to keep starting back at day 1. For people trying to reach a 28 day streak- good luck. You’ll have to just stay personally motivated even though an app you’re paying to work isn’t. It does maintain your weight, and workouts but loses food and water tracking every time this happens too, so you either relog your food/water or miss your streak that day too. My favorite part is the reading and meditation but I don’t know yet what comes after day 15 since I’m continually getting put back to day 1- not sure if this is also why I’m not seeing my workouts get more intense but there is no progression from when I started a month ago.  It’s easy and keeps me accountable which is the only reason I paid for this subscription/app. If you want to seek out additional workouts you can and they have great customer service which is why I changed my review from a 3 star to 4 star.

4,2023-02-16 17:25:12,"I decided to give this app a try, even though I don’t like paying for exercise apps, because I’m pretty athletic and know a lot, but I wanted some extra ideas and workouts to add into my days. So I am on day three of this app, and so far, I’m really enjoying, for the most part, doing the exercises. I love how there’s a variety of different exercises for fitness levels, age, mobility, etc. My only problem is this. I just did the HIIT Session work out for the first time. It’s the first workout in the HITT category. I liked the exercises, but there were a lot of glitches. A lot of the instruction was not matching up to what the athlete was doing in the video. Also, as time went on, the video was not advancing. So as I’m doing the advanced Burpee exercise, I found myself doing it for over five minutes, and I found that extremely odd. Then I thought well maybe they’re boosting the time, to add intensity. But, that definitely was not the case. When I hit the fast forward button, it went right into the exercise, and then switch to the next one. The next one is demonstrated, and then it stayed on, again, for an extended amount of time. Again I had to advance it manually to the next. This happened with numerous exercises and was very frustrating. A workout that was supposed to be 32 minutes long ended up being almost 50 minutes. So this definitely needs to be resolved. Other than that I have enjoyed the app, so far. I need to explore more of it to see what else it offers.",Great but glitches

1,2019-01-03 05:57:19,I haven’t even tried it and I think apps that make you download to enter all info and then request you to download a paid version (even if there is a free trial) directly after entering info is very misleading.,Don’t download this one.
3,2018-11-24 23:51:35,Unfortunately a lot of the exercises were difficult due to an injury and the app does not offer a modified version of the exercise.,Not Bad
4,2018-10-29 01:11:38,I really like the app. But I wish the food section gave the option of No seafood as the meals have lots of fish.,It’s good

1,2018-05-12 21:53:04,If you are thinking about trying this app make sure if you do not like it to unsubscribe after the free trial or it automatically subscribes you for 6 months!! No nutritional info and the diet is not very helpful. Exercise routines are okay but not informative.,Just a heads up
1,2018-05-04 20:20:41,I was expecting to be able to go on the app without having to buy anything instead of starting a free trial of a week. Make some features free and others you have to pay a monthly fee for.,🤷🏼‍♀️

I guess I will use the remainder for the subscription though",Be careful
2,2018-03-09 02:45:51,Devolved helped me get my refund. They were at least helpful with that. Still wouldn’t do the free trial because they automatically charge you almost $45 if you don’t cancel the free trial.,Update review

They send you an email saying they’re sorry to see you go, then ask you to unsubscribe by clicking a button, which only brings you to the homepage of the app with no further instructions. I assumed this was their way of handling things and that it was cancelled. I then received a $15 charge, then later in November and in December I received two more $30 charges, trying to cancel over and over again the entire time. I finally received an email last week saying a “human” would get back to me within 8 hours and that was 5 days ago. I honestly have no idea how to cancel this and get my money back, short of pulling my card and then worrying about credit issues. The customer service is awful, really the worst ever. It’s like someone decided to start an app and never realized some people would actually want to cancel at some point, and that they needed to have a customer service department to handle things. It’s like it doesn’t exist at all.   **UPDATE: customer service did eventually get in touch with me and were extremely polite and professional, despite my initial aggravated attitude. I really appreciated that, as it’s something that’s truly lacking in society today. I also received every dime back, which I was not expecting. My personal needs still require something other than a home workout app, but the company seems willing to do whatever they need to do to make the experience better for those who can use this sort of program.

3,2018-12-25 14:22:58,"I started with the free 7 day trial to check out this app. While I enjoy the variety of menu options and workouts available, the extent of menus offered and workouts seems limited. If I were to decide to extend my free trial and pay for the subscription I have concerns about the amount of available content in their library, to sustain the program for an entire 6 months or even a year.  At this time, paying for the subscription service at the end of my free trial is not right option for me. I will wait until after the holidays when I am better able to follow the plan to a “t.”  On the other hand, I have to say I am getting frustrated about the lack of response/support from their support team. I read through all the terms & conditions and my understanding is I will automatically be charged for the “premium subscription” if I do not cancel the service 24hrs prior to the end of my free trial (tomorrow). It states that the user can disable “auto renewing” of the paid subscription in the users Account settings. However, there is no option to disable this in my Acct settings on the BetterMe app. I emailed their support team but have not received any response or feedback yet as to how to do this, to ensure I will not incur a charge when my free trial ends tomorrow. I will be very upset if I am charged for anything - especially as I was very careful before signing up for the free trial to make sure it could be canceled at anytime without any charges, if it was done 24hrs in advance. After trying to do this on my own to no avail and then reaching out to their team for support, I will not be happy if they do not get back to me today so I am not charged for extending a subscription I did not elect to pay for.",Need support

2,2020-11-30 14:59:18,"Overall I would say that my experience has not been good. When I set up my profile, I chose the diet settings that most closely represented my eating habits. It said that was intermittent fasting and added that to my personal daily goals on the home page. I went to change it so that I could remove it and was able to change my diet preferences, but the fasting stayed on my home page. I also tried out the food log and found it very frustrating. It doesn’t recognize a lot of foods and is limited in the information you can input for food you have to manually add.  I also purchased some challenges since they were on sale. The personal coach really just feels like a robot. They are not very engaging or interactive. The coach uploads the exercises everyday at the time that you made the purchase (so hopefully you didn’t purchase them late at night)! You have to start the challenge the day you purchased it if you want to properly track your progress through the app (otherwise it will say that you failed that day). All the exercises are not directly connected to the challenge. They get uploaded to your inbox. And you cannot delete any of your old messages or organize them in any way so you have to sift through all your messages and figure out which one you’re looking for. When you do do your workout for the day, some of the videos don’t explain the exercise prior to you starting it and there’s no count down or beeps to notify you when an exercise starts or stops so you have to be paying attention to the video. The challenge might also have a different name than advertised after you purchase it, so that can be slightly confusing.   The only upside is that since the messages never delete, the exercises are there for you to use whenever you get around to them. The lack of continuity within the app really takes away from the experience.",Not User Friendly

5,2022-01-21 12:44:08,"I subscribed about 5 days ago and like it so far. I was having an issue after I paid for my subscription. I downloaded the app on my iPad because I prefer to have the bigger screen for the workouts. But when I tried to sign in it didn’t recognize any of my info. It was extremely frustrating at first because I paid for this. Plus I was about to buy a new phone that day and wanted to have it logged on the new phone for the notifications.  So I emailed them like 6:30 am my time. I wasn’t expecting a fast response due to my time zone but minutes later I received an email. I found out in a search they’re Uk time zone. The person responding was very friendly. But she couldn’t find my email or login or anything. So she suggested sending screenshots of my subscription and stuff.  Anyway l was just getting frustrated and ready to cancel because I have little patience (something I’m working on) but they really was patient with me and very friendly and finally came up with a simple solution to get me logged on.   Great customer service means a lot to me. So that alone gets 5 stars. Also I like the workout options. I would say it would be nice if there were more of the body positive workouts. But the variety of workouts is pretty good. I did a partial boxing workout after a body positive one which I’m feeling.   Someone left a review saying they don’t need the meal plan and that meals need a separate app? That’s kind of a dumb suggestion. While I don’t have to have a meal plan, I do like it. I’m On the keto diet and get bored with my own meals. So it’s nice this app has a keto diet category where I can get some different meal ideas. Overall I’m happy with this app. I’m using it and it’s motivating.",Great Customer Service

3,2019-02-04 05:37:13,"I have mixed feelings about this app because I like it but at the same time I don’t. So prior to this app I was (am) using the app Workout for Women but I heard about this app on Instagram and I thought I might try it. I’m currently doing the one week free trial (and I’m so glad I did because my mixed feelings are making me feel unsure of paying the $10 weekly) and I think they’re meal plans are AH-MAZING! They’re easy, delicious, and within your calorie limit not to mention healthy (duh). I guess my mixed feeling are in the workouts, they’re great BUT I reeeeeally wish that it counted for me the reps because personally, I HATE counting when I’m doing an exercise. I’m so focused on working the part of my body I’m exercising I either lose track and have to start all over, over count, or am counting and don’t really work on the area of my body. And that’s what I like about my other app, it counts for me (in seconds) and I just focus on going working the area of my body until the timer runs out.  My suggestion: Before every exercise it counts down from 10 and if the exercise is, let’s say, 25 reps, once the bell rings (initiating the exercise) the doll demonstrating starts doing the 25 reps and we can follow at the speed their doing the exercise (you could even show the number of times she’s performing them that way theirs no need to keep track because your seeing it on the screen). I’m telling you, the app has that and I ditch my other app in a heart beat. The entire time I was exercising I was thinking ‘oh how I wish I didn’t have to count!’😩 lol. I think this app is good but the fact that I don’t feel like I can work my body properly because of the counting (as stupid as that sounds) just keeps me from thinking it’s great. I ended up going back to my other app, although I will still be using this app. I’m gonna use my week trial just to see how I feel about it through the end.🤞",Mixed feelings🙃

I signed up because I was really excited to do the somatic body type exercises and once I signed up what I was being pushed the most was lifestyle and diet changes, which is not what I had originally thought I was signing up for!! The marketing was incredibly misleading as all the marketing showed were the exercises with no hint of the app also being a lifestyle and diet app. I’m sure some people can use this, but this is not what I need. I’m a survivor of quite a lot of trauma, and have quite a lot of ptsd so I’m aware of what my challenges are. My diet is actually already really good, I work in the health care business.   Upon trying to log into the app and use it to give it a chance, I couldn’t get in as the app wanted me to pay again, a bug on Betterme’s end, so I’ve reached out to customer support four or five times, at least, and have just been written back and am ignored again when I asked for a refund, so essentially I paid for a service I couldn’t use and paid for some thing that I wouldn’t have bought if the company had been more transparent with what their services were.   Customer service has been terrible and $40 (trial week plus monthly membership fee) is quite a lot of money to pay for something I couldn’t use. My advise is don’t sign up with these guys. I’m halfway on the fence to just reporting them to my bank and getting my money back.  As of today a whole month later the tech team has finally put in the cancel subscription button and I can finally get logged in after they took my money and sat on it for over a month with zero service access and no customer service despite trying to reach them repeatedly. This is a Terrible company and that has terrible service. Do not use!!!","DO NOT USE, crooked company"

5,2020-01-23 14:19:53,"I love everything it has so far. Face workout to the full body and meal plans also the daily tracking is helpful make so be more subconscious about everything. That being said I’ve tried to change my meal plan since I started but it is still on the same one I first selected it reads that it has changed on my profile but it hasn’t when I look at the food section.  Also, should put a search engine for the food search so that I don’t waste time looking at everything just have to type in egg for example and that will then populate all recipes with egg in it. Another suggestion is to categorize the food but breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, treats. I use to use this app that would track everything I ate made recommendations as well, but my favorite part and what helped me the most was that it knew the calories, sugars, proteins, sodium, etc. in all foods and if it did not know it you could add them in or scan the nutritional value label of each product to make a combined and better out come at least I noticed that worked great for me and everyone that I knew was doing the same.   Another suggestion is that you also have an alarm or reminder of sorts to remind people like me with two kids a husband or just plain forgetful for everything like meals or water intake or just fit in a quick workout where ever I am.  Lastly, I keep forgetting to log my water in take or other things so maybe allow access to in our previous day(s) like minimal access to avoid lying...

4,2023-08-11 16:40:05,"First of all I do like the app. However I previously used the myplate app and there were a few things I liked about it better but unfortunately they discontinued the app.   When calorie tracking on Myplate, in the space on the right side of the search bar for food, they had the barcode icon right there so it was easy to click without having to go into another menu to select. Just hit it and scan to track. It would almost always come up with the right serving size and information… Also they offered a paid plan that would track micronutrients in food as well. It’s beneficial if you know you should be supplementing certain nutrients and want to do it through diet vs pills. This app doesn’t have that feature. When giving daily calorie recommendations MyPlate took into consideration resting and active energy consumption from the apple health app as well as your weight goals to give recommendations. I’m curious if BetterMe does this as well or not?   Also I know the calorie tracker on this app has recent foods underneath the search menu but they aren’t specific to that meal (ie. breakfast) by the time I get to breakfast the following day what I had for breakfast the previous day is not there anymore because I added lunch and dinner after. Perhaps instead of recent searches just have a history for that meal. I eat overnight oats frequently and I have to search for and add the milk, oats, chai seeds, etc all every time because it’s been bumped out of the recents menu by lunch and dinner.   I really do like the app there’s just little things like that would make it way more user friendly. Keep up the good work and thanks for what you do. I enjoy the fasting information and recommended workout routines.",Good could be better

1,2020-11-16 15:29:00,"I purchased the app thinking the cost of the app was the only purchase needed. If you want a meal plan and or join any of the challenges/workouts you have to spend an additional cost for each of those. Plus an additional cost for subscription which they don’t keep track of any of your purchases so you have to show proof of purchases because they don’t keep any records of them. My trainer said I hadn’t purchased anything yet but I sent him a screenshot and clearly I had, but apparently it was just for having a coach who frankly hasn’t helped me yet.   Didn’t give me my money back even though I never used any of their workouts or articles. Complete waste of $50! You could easily spend $100+ bucks with their clever pop up ads for their different programs when you least expect it and if you were already about to click on something then you accidentally purchased a program you didn’t have time to look into first. That’s what happened to me and I said, I’m out of this rat trap! Don’t waste your time, otherwise you’ll be spending a lot of money that you will never get back.  Update: ugh!! Finally they paid me back what was rightfully mine but then out of the blue charged me again and I had already deleted the app and the subscription off my phone and still I got charged for the silly app. I don’t understand how there are even good reviews for this app it’s a complete waste of money and time. The time I spend emailing these robbers trying to get my money back I could be in better shape by now. Don’t waste your time or money. This is an honest to goodness review, don’t trust the other reviews because they probably got paid to say those things.",Complete waste of money!

1,2020-12-14 17:37:50,"I signed up for this app but with everything going on with the pandemic was unable to use it so want to cancel it. There’s no place in the app to cancel it so it renewed by the time the customer service responded to me. They then did cancel it with charge me $20 for the next month and it was right at the day of renewal that I had tried canceling but was unable to because that was not in the app. Customer service responded with a generic response to my concern and then went Ghost for 4 days and came back with the same generic response. Total scam - if you want to be so strict with your policies you should make it where customers can cancel subscriptions on their own in the app not wait a day for customer service. I’d give this app ZERO stars I could!! I’ve been using iPhones and iOS since 2007 -I’ve never given a bad review until today because I don’t appreciate companies that trap you into continuing to pay.  In response to the developers comments: Your company has updated the App fourteen times just in the past month - I can assure you I was unable to find a cancel subscription section when I had looked to cancel. That being said, it doesn’t change the fact that your customer service has gave me a generic response and then ignored messages for days to only provide a similar generic response. As a business owner my request for your service that I never used and was unable to cancel on my own did not seem unreasonable as I would gladly refund any of my customers that don’t use my products or service and make the effort to cancel in a timely manner but in the digital space once you have my billing info it’s “Gotcha”",Scam - no way to cancel subscription

1,2020-08-24 16:23:02,"Everything about this app sounded great! I came across it on Pinterest. $30 for 6 months and a 7 day free trial week sounded like a great deal! BUT, it charged my card for the 6 months right away and NO free trial. I like it as a basic logging app, BUT the calories are ALL wrong on their end. I have to look up calories on the web all the time. Everything automatically comes up at 3.53 ounces and high calorie counts. Even when you use the barcode scan option, so watch that! A lot of times the recipes are very vague for amounts of ingredients needed AND the picture is not what the recipe actually is. EX: flaxseed crepes with cream cheese and salmon, but shows a picture of crepes with bananas and cream. LOL...what? In the beginning (one week ago) I was able to look at future recipes and plan my meals so I could shop for the week, now I can only see my meals for the day. AND they are locked out!! So, I have to click on each recipe, then it pops up 2 more money wanting ads I have to close out before I can get to the recipe. Mind you, I’ve already paid for the complete app with meal planning. Not a good way to meal plan. I don’t like to go to the store everyday. In addition to the meals they choose for you, it asks you to Change, Log, or Skip. When I log, it only asks if you would make the meal again...basically yes or no. If you say no, it wants to know why. It pops up a box AND you have to fill it out. The annoying part is, you then have to go into the tracker and log the calories. LOL...what’s the point of logging it on the recipe if it’s not going to log it for you in the tracker. A simple fix. Add the calories to the tracker. BUT, again the calories are not right most of the time, so watch that too. You could be robbing yourself of precious calories and may not be eating enough since their calorie count is ALWAYS much higher. Also, when you go to log the meal they provided, a lot of times it’s not even in their tracker menu lookup. So, it takes more time to track the meal because you have to find the calories for each ingredient you used. It also does it allow you to see what you have eaten and recorded thus far. Since I’m having to fix EVERY recipe for calorie intake, it’s quite annoying to have to look this stuff up everyday. Another problem with this site is the Contact Us option. It doesn’t even have auto correct, which is such a basic option for emails. I type fast and have to go back and fix basic mistakes that could be auto corrected. That’s a sign of a very cheap platform. The exercise programs are good, BUT act as if you should know the routine already. It could offer some sort of indicator to the next exercise coming up. The most annoying and time consuming part to me is the calorie counter. I have gone into settings and all is checked for the correct measurement units, but still does not work right. It’s only been 5 days for me and I’ve experienced this much disappointment already. Hopefully they fix a these major issues so it makes it worth the time I signed up.   When you sign up, it offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee or your money back. But after reading the customer reviews, and the responses from BetterMe, it does not seem to address anyone’s issues. The responses are all vague and do not seem to solve the problems. Bots must be responding.    Come on guys, fix the app!!! This is ridiculous. You’re taking people’s money, but not following through with what you offer in your advertisement to join. It has potential, BUT needs a ton of work. If I had known all these issues I would spend my money on another more dependable app.  Keep looking consumers, do not signup for this app. It’s a rip-off.",Don’t Fall for It!!

3,2023-03-19 16:43:51,"I really like the comprehensive approach this app is built around. As a retired psychotherapist I can also attest to the quality of the psychological section, if fits into up to date psychological thinking and I found personally helpful. The tracking of the day’s water intake is fine.   Where the app really falls into almost uselessness is the calorie tracking function. Examples are: calories are only totaled on a  “What you have eaten so far” basis. There are no totals for each individual meal. Since I am able to subtract I can find the total but it is another step for the user. If you search for a food you could get 20 choices with inconsistent values. This is very confusing and confusing doubt that you are getting correct data. There are not useful measuring methods. I don’t need to know the calories for 3.5 ounces of olive oil, I need to know the calories for 1 Tablespoon. There needs to be many more options for measurement.  Another irritant is when you edit an item, it shows up at the top with only it’s name and measurement not the number of calories that measurement. I need that total because I have to check it with other sources in order to see if one tablespoon is equivalent to one ounce. Say I find that 1 tablespoon is equivalent to .5 ounces  The adjustment in the serving size does not allow an entry starting with a dismal point.  There are MANY other problems with the calorie tracking function but I have too much to do to list them. I suggest you take a look at other calorie counting apps. Try tracking you own meals for 2-3 days. I won’t sign up again as long as this function is so dysfunctional.",The idea of this app is better than its function

1,2019-05-19 12:34:21,You guys trap people to download the app displaying that it's free.. BUT OF COURSE it's a monthly fee just to look at the work outs 🙄,🤦🏾‍♀️
4,2019-04-28 15:52:45,"I never write reviews, but I’m a developer and dancer so I wanted to give some suggestions to continue the great work this team has already started. I thoroughly enjoy what this app has to offer. LIKES: -Workouts broken down into problem areas -Rep suggestions, timers, skip feature -Beautiful graphics -Food options -Water tracker  SUGGESTIONS: -Modification options: I recently had a baby and need to work up to some of these exercises. I’m a dancer so I can modify myself, but know this would help others. -Accurate time duration. I’d like to know if I rushed my reps or took my time. Also, would like to know how this altered the calories burned. -360 view: there was one exercise I hadn’t done before, and it wasn’t clear to me from the side view. I know this would require a lot more development, but if you could spin the graphic or at least have the ability to have front and side views that would be ideal. -Menu: this is a good first gen, but could use more options (perhaps I’m only receiving 7 options because I’m still on the trial). I’d like to be able to ‘favorite’ ones I like. It’d also be nice if these recipes shared a few ingredients so it made sense financially and practically. -More guided text. I like the completion screens but I’m not sure how that calculates into my goal. It’d be nice to have a progress bar in my profile and continue to move it along with every exercise. -Email sign up: I don’t have Facebook. Am I missing out on features because I can’t sign up? -More advanced exercises as you progress. I like to work towards goals. -Maybe a section for endurance? -It’d be cool to be able to do 28-day challenges with friends, track their progress, etc. It would give more incentive to use the app :) That’s all for now. Excited to see what else you guys come up with. Thanks!",Dancer dev

Three days go by and I’m in love with the app and then suddenly, I can’t access the recipes then the app suggests that only for the 1 year membership? Cool, whatever, my 7 day trial is still not up so I figured ok I’ll pay for the one year even though my 7 day is not up because I was gonna do that anyway. I pay $30 and I have access to the recipes again, yay me! Another week goes bay and I lose weight and everything. Then suddenly I lose access the recipes again!!!!? I payed the money and 1 year had not expired yet so what could be the issue? I email the customer service and anything that is related to better me and no response. It gets to the point where I have to contact Apple and of course they resolve my issue but I still love the app, the suggested I get my refund and try making another account using my email and not Apple ID. I do that to another $30 after I get my refund for the first try and I make another account using me email. BIG MISTAKE. Another week goes by after I pay and AGAIN I lose access to the recipes!? At this point I’m fed up and canceled and resubscribed like 20 times making sure I payed and still I cannot access the recipes!? This is the final time I will do this, I will permanently delete the app and not reinstall. I am waiting for my final refund and I suggest that to whoever is planing to get this app that you think twice about it.",App Steals Money - Cannot Access Recipes

1,2019-03-27 23:05:28,"I was under the impression that this was a FREE app. I was very excited to get started and I started 4 of the programs (stomach, arms, legs and back) and did the first sessions. I was ready to be committed. After I finished day 1 of my “28 day plans” it had me schedule a time for the second sessions the next day. Happy to find a workout from an app that I really liked, I tried to start my second lesson. Emphasis on TRIED. It wouldn’t let me proceed without SUBSCRIBING TO THEIR STUPID $9.99 /month service. I thought the full version was just to get additional features but NO. It’s to get access to the service in the first place. The worst part is the company tried to hide it. This is advertised as a FREE APP that has in app purchases. Their plan is to lure you in by simply downloading their free “miracle weight loss app” only to give you access to nothing besides the option to buy the full version. It’s DISGRACEFUL I’m a teenager who really needed this in my life and my mom is simply not willing to pay for me to get basic workouts (understandably so)  Dear developers,  I hope you enjoy cashing in on your coin. Just hope you know deep down inside that you’re scammers that are trying to take advantage of vulnerable and desperate people looking to make a healthy change in their lives. I bet you’re sleeping on beds made of cash while you laugh at the people who are desperate enough to fall victim to your trap. You’re supposed to be like a helpful source for people like me.

2,2023-07-03 11:19:51,"The concept of this app is good. I like that there are various workout plans and ways to record your diet. But I really got frustrated with the user friendliness of the app. I did the sugar challenge and the lessons that I was supposed to receive did not show up. They indicated this is something the team was working on, but it wasn’t resolved even after several days.  Email communications from the support team/coaches would pop up on my phone’s notifications but not in the actual chat box. The messages disappeared .  I attempted to update the app, but when I did that, my progress changed: it show that I had not completed all the lessons that I actually completed.   There is a significant delay in terms of when the coaches respond to you. I think that is mostly because of the difference in country. However, the coaches are very supportive.   There is a disconnect between the material, lessons, and the meal plans provided. I got confused in terms of what it is I should be doing.  For the sugar detox, I want you to include your meals. They need to have something similar like my fitness pal which recalls your meals as you start typing. This task is very tedious and if you’re in the United States, the measurements are different.   Finally because I was so frustrated, I decided to cancel the subscription. I decided to do it 15 days until the subscription. Normally a subscription allows you to continue with your current plan.

1,2019-04-30 11:28:12,"I clicked on what was called a ‘free trial’ in this app and then realized the app didn’t have what I expected and cancelled immediately. A week or so later, I came across the app again, forgot what it was, and clicked on the ‘free trial’ again because clicking through is the only way to look at what the app provides. Apparently I was not eligible for the second ‘free trial’- although there were zero disclosures saying this- and my iTunes account was charged the full amount. I scrolled through the app and despite claims that you can ‘cancel at any time’ in the small print, no option to cancel exists. The app seemed to also put me into ‘premium’ auto renewal service, and it’s taken me multiple calls and emails to Apple to try to fix this. Emails to a contact provided in this app did not receive any response.  UPDATE. Developer, after seeing how often this occurs and your lack of response other than to say ‘too bad’,  I’m reporting this app and your misleading billing practices to the CA Attorney General as a violation of CA auto renewal laws, (as well as other state’s consumer protection laws and federal law). I suggest you amend your practices ASAP and provide refunds to the many MANY consumers on here who were clearly mislead and over charged. My contact after that will be to some CA consumer class action attorneys. Good luck.  FURTHER UPDATE: I received a response from the developer ‘sorry, it’s Apple’s issue, we can’t help you’. Meanwhile, Apple pointed me to BetterMe saying ‘it’s the app’s policy, we can’t help you.’ In sum, I was charged 21 dollars for a ‘free trial’ and both companies refuse to correct it (although both benefit from my payment and the payment of many others similarly mislead) and both are violating consumer protection laws. I will report both practices to my state Attorney General consumer protection division and to class action lawyers. I advise anyone on here to whom this has happened to do the same. Thanks",Charged my account without notice and there is no way to cancel

3,2020-09-29 04:51:59,"I like this app but it’s not practical for the everyday busy lifestyle in regards to the meal plan specifically. For example, if I’m trying to plan out my meals for the next day & make sure I’m not going over my calorie intake, etc, it does NOT allow to “log meal” from the meal plan (or anything for that matter) for the next day or anytime in the future. It’s very strict on what you need to eat for the day, but I don’t always have king prawns, muesli, wheat bran, millet, or tabbouleh available....nor would that be easy for me to find at the grocery store & cook personally because I would have to research how-to first. Some of the meals can take an hour to cook, with grilling & baking involved, & sometimes I don’t have that kind of time nor can I heat up my house that way during the summer. It’s also extremely difficult to find food in the search bar to log in food that isn’t in the meal plan. I tried adding Starbucks egg white bites & it’s no where to be found. So if you want to steer off the meal plan by finding another healthy option, it’s really hard to do! The measuring guide & cooking instructions are confusing too. If you want to cook 3 eggs for breakfast, then it will list the eggs as “eggs - 3 pcs”, but for a snack of just “olives” (no idea if we’re talking black olives, Kalamata olives, castlevetrano olives, garlic stuffed olives) then the meal plan lists as “olives - 50 grams”. Really? From a quick google search, I have to guess that 50 grams worth of olives is 9 olives? Not the end of the world, but like I said, not really convenient when you don’t have a lot of time & you’re trying to meal prep for the next day - or worse, you didn’t meal prep, you need to eat right now, & you have no idea how many grams everything is. Almost everything is listed in grams. I’m not familiar with grams so I have to google each ingredient in the meal plan to not slip up on portions.   The cooking instructions are definitely missing key information.  “Step 1 - Boil pre-soaked lentils”........how long do you pre-soak lentils for? Overnight? A few minutes? How long do I boil the lentils thereafter for exactly? No clue. Back to google again.  “Step 1 - Slice the eggplant into thin pieces, cook it on the grill or pan”............HOW? How long do I cook it in a pan? Do I need olive oil first? Do I need to put salt in it to dry it out & then dab it with a napkin before baking, like when you’re making Eggplant Parmesan? Tell me literally everything please because I do not know. Give me a link with more info if the character limit is that limited.  Suggestions:  - The ability to “log meals” for future dates in order to avoid going over the calorie, protein, & fat limits (aka to avoid slipping).   - The ability to add more information about foods that you can’t find in the search bar, like the protein & fat, instead of just calories. When I googled that egg white bites have 170 calories, I was able to “add food”, but not input that the protein was 13 grams.  - It would be easier if this app could synch with the Fitness Pal app, especially to find foods that are not in the meal plan.  - Clear, step-by-step cooking instructions for beginners.  ***PROS to this App:  - Love that you can track your water intake  - Love the “☝️” suggestions for the meal plans if you want to substitute something because you have an allergy, don’t like fish, etc.  - Love that there is a gluten-free meal plan  - Love the step-by-step workouts & variety of workouts available  - Love the fasting option  - Love the trophies earned for logging in daily to keep up motivation  Thank you!",Like App but needs more convenience with meal plans
2,2020-04-23 18:37:16,"My favorite thing about this are the menu items available and how you can plan for a week and move ingredients to a shopping list. The things that need improvement are: -strange measurements in the recipes (1/5th a cup or 0.01 oz of salt) -you cannot alter ingredients in a meal to correct the calorie count if you don’t use an ingredient  -there is no way to save the menu items you tried and liked so you can print them off. I’ve just been having to write them all down by hand.  -If you enter calories for something off the menu, that is not saved as a quick item. You have to re-enter the name and calories each time.  -when you click “log” underneath a meal, it just asks if you liked it and you have to go to the meal area to manually search for the recipe and add it -you can’t enter calories burned in any way other than their planned workouts. So if you can’t do walking anymore, you can’t log calories burned in another form of exercise.  -the app gives you a “check list” for the day. If you don’t weigh yourself, drink enough water, log your meals, do your planned exercise, you won’t get a “complete” for the day. Several days my calories fell just below the needed number by a few calories so I added calories just to get the “check” for the day. If you’re a completionist and trying to aim for getting “completes” each day, this is annoying.  -there is no search by food option. I bought kale for a recipe and because I didn’t want the rest to go to waste, I had to scroll through all the recipes to find the ones I could use kale with.  -the search for food items need to be improved (ex: no chicken nuggets from McDonalds) to allow for honest reporting of food intake.",Great Idea. Needs Improvement.

2,2021-03-08 12:57:54,"I actually loved the free trial set up. They gave me a bomb work out, had work outs I actually wanted to do that weren’t cheesy, odd and nothing you wouldn’t be familiar with and have experienced with a face to face trainer.  I was super pumped when I got a Valentine’s Day special and then things went sour & no matter how many times I try to use this app or a work out in it I just can’t get into. Not can I find ANY of the work outs I did with the free trial...so there’s that.   Once I purchased my year subscription, bared by the special and the super easy but effective trial work outs...Holy moly it was like getting a completely different app I’d never seen before and had no idea how to navigate. Idk why in the heck things changed so drastically but I do not like a darn thing about this app after the free trial.   Honestly these work outs are all pretty much the same, set up in different orders to seem like you’re getting a lot for your $$. Whats worse, if you want to pair your smart watch with the app, be prepared to charge your watch 2-4 times a day bc this app has to have ALL the features turned on with your watch in order to “work”, unlike other apps where you can pick and choose which features the app can use tailored to you.   There is no ability to use their work outs and make your own tailored work out with their stuff that works best for you and is more personalized. The “coaches” cost ADDITIONAL $$$ & A LOT more.   This wasn’t worth the money and is a huge waste of time. There are other apps out there that don’t cost and have the same exact features as this one and better work outs...that are easier to navigate, personalize and enjoy.  I’ve tried contacting the better me support over literally all of these things, however no matter how many comments or help forums I send them, the response is always a black bar at the top that says “all comments failed to load” even tho the inbox claims I have multiple responses (I cannot read) waiting for me to see, they close out the tickets after 7-10 days of no response...but how is one to respond when the chat is always failing? I check it multiple times a day to see if maybe I’ll be able to see any of my chat tickets I have opened, alas nothing. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled many times and have gotten no where.  Good luck, may the odds be ever in your favor but I doubt it...sorry y’all","Not worth it, not as described"

2,2020-06-19 13:35:00,"I really liked the idea where an app would log calories, exercise, water and give me both meal and exercise recommendations. The whole idea is it’s simpler to track one aggregated rather than many right? Wrong. It has so far deleted data from all my inputs where I have to re-enter, but that’s not even half the problem.  The calorie tracker isn’t even half baked- I subscribe to meal services like daily harvest and freshly, all of their meals/cups/smoothies have their nutritional values posted online, well finding them on this app will be like blues clues gone wrong (hint: get used to typing it all up yourself, then having the app delete that so you do it all over again). The scanning is also dismal, as when you do scan an Item, if it even finds the barcode, the only option is to then change the intake in ounces- good luck converting all your serving sizes now matter what type of food or liquid, to ounces.   Then water- you have to manually add, can’t link to an app where this might be tracked (I use hidratespark)  Exercise, the moment you don’t click next, or complete, it deletes the data as if you did not exercise at all, so you can go through it all by clicking but all of your values in regards to length/calories burnt etc will be gone.   The only thing that does come through is number of steps but you know what? I have basic apple apps for that I didn’t have to pay extra for.   Seems like anything that felt enticing is also a “challenge” that you would have to pay additional for, but given the crap I got for my initial purchase, I think not.","Idea is great but user experience is pretty bad, sorry I paid for this app"

1,2023-09-01 18:24:38,"Just under 5 hours, the truth reveals itself . . . Better Me is a scam and will steal your money without trace. I NEVER do reviews, BUT this is one that I CANNOT ignore so I can help someone else.   This app seemed AMAZING from start and until I purchase the 6-month subscription. Afterwards, this is a complete and total mess.   As a mom of a three year old and a three month old, this app seemed like an answer prayer to get back in shape and health, I felt like I got kicked in the stomach and beat up to the ground for the $180.   Your app states, ""To request a refund, follow these instructions from the Apple support page."" I want to cover all of my bases for a large purchase from the app store.   1) The initial 7-day trial of $10. This should have been waved for reason number 2.  2) I decided to purchase the 6-month subscription to save me ""20% of total purchase,"" and the $10 subscription fee was shown as a negative for my total subscription purchase. 3) I purchased a premium meal plan and workouts, but it is not working correctly when I log out and back into it. I tried three times and still removed my information except for my steps because it is connected to the health in the iPhone. I cannot properly track my information to a Better Me.  4) Any subscription that is purchased from the Apple store will be a receipt, of which there is no receipt in my email. Secondly, you can view all subscriptions in the app store along with the renewal date, which Better Me does not appear on my list. It appears on ""Purchased,"" which is not the proper place. Next, when I review my app, it appears as ""free"". This is not right or correct. Lastly, ""To request a refund, follow these instructions from the Apple support page,"" The Better Me app does not appear as a subscription purchase and Apple cannot refund any purchase, in turn, which Apple cannot trace to refund the money. 5) Due to the above reasons, I would like an immediate refund. You’ve been emailed today. I highly doubt it will be received and refund honored.",BEST REVIEW & MOST HONEST REVIEW YOU’LL EVER READ!!!

1,2022-04-03 16:16:27,"I have never written a review as negative as this so do hope readers take the time to consider this.  On principle I was looking forward to utilizing the app, including buying the several up selling features, but little did I appreciate there was much more to be known.  An example is once launching the app it started the fasting period at noon, ending at 4 a.m.  I don’t know about you but I don’t get up at 4 a.m. nor am I interested in eating.  No assistance or easy guidance on how to change.  I tried the chat as well, no meaningful response.  Next was I pulled up the day one of the menu.  Everything involved at least 30 minutes of preparation with ingredients that aren’t readily available, even in my grocery store.  Good example is one meal called for squid.  I looked for a feature where you can select a different meal or put in what foods you don’t like.  For example I don’t eat shellfish, rarely food seafood at home.  You can select entire diet styles like vegan and Mediterranean, but I’m not necessarily any of the other diet styles and even still suspect squid would still appear.  Day 1 really?    With an 8 hour window to eat I realistically don’t know how the 4 or 5 meals and snacks could be put together and ate while trying to put in a work day.  Any realistic diet would have more choices that are easily put together and require less cooking.  Don’t get me wrong I cook and I cook frequently at home, but every meal?  Then when I navigated back to the Home Screen (this is on day 0, as I hadn’t even had a chance to use the app yet).  It showed me on day 2.  Next it was so complicated with minimal to no overview on how the whole thing fit together between the exercise, fasting and meal plan portions.  I did pay for coaching but no idea how that is accessed.  You are left on your own devices to navigate through.  As clearly this did will not fit my lifestyle and I’ll return to using my Cooking Light Diet app, from the previously a forenamed magazine, I wrote to customer service to cancel my membership, which should include refunding everything I purchased under any legitimate consumer protection law.  The response I received is my membership was cancelled, thank-you, but to enjoy using the app till 3 months into the future.  That was the straw that broke the camel’s back.  Yes it included some links to some help desk pages, but those do not resolve my concerns or make it useable for me.    Much clearer transparency should be provided in their marketing materials.  I’m sure this works for some, but my guess not many because of how complicated it is.  Buyer beware.  I don’t even believe not refunding me what I’ve paid within an hour of buying is even within consumer protection laws in the state of WA.",Buyer Beware

1,2019-01-18 04:20:39,"The only reason I downloaded this app was because it appeared free in the App Store.  When I entered age, weight etc it wanted to connect to Facebook and showed different subscription options. I figured it’s one of many apps that one can download free, but after a couple workouts it would say “to continue” please subscribe. I did not want to pay for any subscription, there are plenty truly free and much better resources out there. I did not subscribe, looked through the app, wasn’t impressed, never used once and forgot all about it.  A week later a charge of 57$+ dollars showed up on my credit card. I monitor daily. I wanted to call credit card company to report fraudulent transaction, but decided to log into my account first to see if it would show what is the charge for.   Turned out it’s subscription for this App kicked in. Apparently by downloading free app, you are actually subscribing to 7 day free trial ( free indeed) and then automatically are subscribed for 6 month plan with the app and your card is charged. Unless you cancel within 7 days. It wasn’t specified anywhere. I thought this app was just like all the other apps out there that either expire after trial period or prompt you to subscribe if you want to continue using. NO other app ever charged me without prompting to choose and agree to subscription. Very shady. Also, they have different tiers: 9.99 per month, 6.99 for some other period- many options. I, of course, was automatically subscribed to the most expensive “premium” ( whatever that means) version.   Overall, unethical business practices aside, this app isn’t worth it even if it was free. Recipes are basic, you don’t need an app to tell you to take chicken breast and peppers, put them in the pan and cook until ready. Laughable. Workouts worth 28 days. Subscription is for 6 months, not sure why would I need subscription for so long when workouts end after less than a month.","Do NoT download, they will charge 57$+ dollars for this “free” app"

1,2021-03-02 17:33:22,"I was excited to get to use this app to help me be more consistent with intermittent fasting. Like some other reviews here, I had many issues with the timer. When you forgot to set it or start it, there was no was to manually adjust it so that it would be correct. Also, as far as adjustments go, i couldn't ever find a way to adjust any goals; I only had to use the goals they set according to my quiz results. For instance, the water tracker feature set my goal at 3.2L, but my actual goal is 9L lol. While I could continue to add to my water intake, it was just one more frustration with the app.   For meal planning, they had a really great variety of vegan foods that I was super excited about trying. However, every single meal and snack was different. For someone that's busy, I can't cook up that much food in advance. And there's no grocery list to help you out there either. I certainly don't have time to sit down and write out recipes for 28 different dishes a week!!!   When I emailed them my concerns on separate occasions for separate issues, they never responded to my emails...at all! I would say the customer service was bad but it was nonexistent. By far the worst money I've ever tried on a new app. Don't use it.  UPDATE: customer service did respond and gave me a full refund. However, they only responded to me AFTER I left this terrible review. And they've continued to hound me to change my review...which in my mind is terrible customer support. Thanks for the money back I guess.",Terrible app overall

Já consigo ver resultados no meu corpo e me sinto muito mais saudável! A aplicação em si também é muito fácil de usar. Mostram exactamente como os exercícios devem ser feitos e põem um timer no ecrã enquanto se fazem os exercícios. Outra coisa que gosto é o facto de fornecerem as receitas para cada refeição que eu tenho de preparar em cada dia. Ajuda-me bastante a poupar tempo na procura desses detalhes!   Só não consigo pôr as calorias exactas e a quantidade de água que consumo. A app usa um botão que desliza numa escala e não um espaço para pôr os números exactos. Isso dificulta no controlo do meu progresso com precisão. Tbm acho que os preços podiam ser um pouco mais baixos para me motivar a continuar.

When I called Felix informed me that since I logged into the website that I had needed to cancel on the website. After a bit he said he could refund me the latest withdrawal. Why not both.

The instruction for the exercise should be given in the setup not during the actual exercise. You lose time figuring out the proper technique.   For what it’s is, it’s not worth it so far.

My first problem was that when you sign up for wall Pilates, you’re not getting what you see on Instagram. It’s a sad 9-20 min workout. The one-on-one portion to talk to a coach charges you separately and then doesn’t work. They told me to delete and reinstall the app, it didn’t work. They refuse to give me my money back. I mean $3.99. They must really need it. I’ve asked multiple times besides the fact that it’s illegal to keep someone’s money for services not rendered. The app is poorly laid out, hard to find things and isn’t intuitive. Honestly, they have great free wall Pilates workouts on YouTube that are much better. Save your money and headaches.","Garbage App, Bad Customer Service"
1,2023-08-15 13:43:53,So I got the app because my schedule changed and I wanted a good Pilates type workout I could do at home. The “classes” are so short you don’t feel like you did enough and I couldn’t do multiple days in a row. It’s more of a calorie count with meals and water count. I was bummed.    UPDATE: I canceled the subscription two weeks before the end date and this company tried charging me over ten times 30.99! I had to get a new bank card because of it! Do not ever use this app!,This app is a money scam! Don’t use it!!!
1,2023-08-14 00:03:07,"I purchased BetterMe annual subscription recently ($29.99) and was disappointed to find out that it costs a whole lot more to get any coaching tips or to participate in any of the in-app fitness challenges, on top of the annual subscription fee. You basically get the same features in this app that you get for free on the basic Fitbit app. BetterMe does not sync with Fitbit, by the way, so your Fitbit steps don’t get logged. A week after I subscribed to BetterMe, I got logged out of my account somehow and the app no longer recognizes my email address so I can’t reset my password or log back in. I contacted BetterMe’s customer support and still, a whole week later, have not received a response. Don’t waste your money subscribing to this app. The only pro I can think of for this app is that it reminds you when to begin and end your fast, but you can easily do that by setting a reminder on your phone. I hope my review is helpful.","Bait and switch app, terrible customer service"
1,2023-08-12 04:53:43,"After the daily workout (1 set for 10 mins), if you want to continue, the exercises are poorly done. There is no break to change position; it just continues, and before you even get to start, it’s already halfway through then, time to change the workout.

1,2023-08-11 12:23:13,"You have to pay for the challenges, so if in their very good advertisements you saw a couple that you wanted to try, know you’re only getting the one in the ad you clicked on without giving them more money, beyond your monthly subscription. Or you could find challenges for free on YouTube. The app is designed well, but it is not actually designed for accountability, so if you’re someone who needs that, don’t bother with this program. It congratulates you daily for challenges you decide are a waste of time and quit, and it does this for the full 30 days. I tried several of the workouts and found the flow was awkward. From standing to floor to standing to all fours (things like that could be in the middle), which some could argue is part of the exercise except you’re doing this for so little time it’s just a waste and just why?",Disappointing

And a convoluted, web of confusion explanation from someone named Bruce. I was assured it would not try to charge me anymore, but alas tonight it tried to hit me 10 times. STAY AWAY FRON THIS APP!  Absolute rip off, with no recourse. I canceled the free trial in plenty of time because none of the plans made since. But then I got a notification for a deal $19.44 for the whole year so I thought ok I’ll do it, then immediately changed my mind and went back and canceled it. It was literally minutes later. They have been trying to charge me every day since. I’ve had to remove all cards from my Apple ID, if I add any back to try to pay for other subscriptions, better me immediately tries to charge me.

1,2023-08-08 20:12:28,"Throughly frustrated with this app & it’s “support” . I stopped using the app for a week probably closer to two months ago now at this point. The app had updated and logged me out. When I attempted to sign in with the information I know I used to create and account and HAD ALSO PAID $30 TO USE THE APP, it said my information was not linked to that email. So I decided, hey, maybe I used to wrong email the first time I attempted my password reset. So I’ve tried resetting my password with various emails to no avail. They all say that the emails are not connected to any account. So I reached out to support. I only submitted one help request due to the fact that they say submitting more than one help request can delay how quickly they get back to you. It’s been about a month now and still no word from support. I am so aggravated at the fact that I paid money for this app and now no information I provide can get me signed in! I’ll submit another help request soon. If I can hear back from support, I’d still like to use the app. I enjoyed it for the most part, and once again… I paid $30 for it..

1,2023-08-08 16:11:37,"I was excited to try “wall Pilates” but the workout has no fluidity between exercises. That coupled with the text to voice is insulting and clearly AI generated. It should explain the exercises when it’s showing the 4 second sample of the exercise, not when you’re supposed to be doing it already. Not enough instruction either - never explains how close/far to be away from the wall.   Thankfully it was only $15 so not too wasteful.

3,2023-07-12 01:16:49,"After several cordial email conversations with the marketing team, I am updating my 1 star to 3 stars. I was instructed how to turn off auto-renewal, have done that and then cancelled the account, and have received a partial refund.  I am thankful to have been heard and for the response. Everyone please know I have learned my lesson and will ho back to my normal rule of never responding to an unsolicited marketing ad. Thankful for the lesson and for the fair result.   Update after Developer Response 060123. Thank you for your response. In the email I received today, your rep stated that users are warned before automatic charges take place. I received no such warning. The only communication I received from BetterMe was AFTER the charge for the full price renewal was made. I communicated with you immediately after receiving that first communication. After the communication from you today, my request for refund and my frustration with your lack of consideration for your clients is totally justified. My prayer is that other FaceBook potential customers will do what I failed to do, which is to check negative reviews before responding to your ads. Good customer service promotes good customer loyalty. You have an opportunity here to demonstrate that kind of good customer service. I am still… Greatly Disappointed. Update after Developer response 052923. Thank you for your response. I have 3 Case IDs, 4828898, 4796698, 4793040. I alerted you to cancel the charge for an additional term on the day you alerted me of the charge. There was no courtesy message beforehand which is typical on other accounts. I have cancelled the account via the App. It would be great and typical good customer service for you to refund the charge as requested. I prefer to continue the conversation with you in this forum, but would also like confirmation of the refund and the deleting of my credit card info from your records via email as I have previously requested. Thank you. I saw BetterMe in a FaceBook ad some time ago. The ad said the app was on sale for 50% off. I do not normally reply to FB ads but was wanting help with my walking program. I have since moved on from the app and have deleted it. I was surprised this weekend to receive an international auto charge on my credit card for another 90 days of “full subscription” price. There was no warning or opportunity to decide or decline, just a confirmation auto-email. I have replied with a request to confirm cancellation and to request a refund. I also clicked on Support and Billing buttons to register my complaint. I have heard from no one. Please be aware. I had to reinstall the app b/c apparently that is the only way to cancel auto-pay. I am concerned that other reviewers say that charges have continued. It would be great to hear from someone at BetterMe.",Thankful for eventual response of developer and partial refund

Two days before the free trial expired I cancelled the app, so that’s why I want a refund. It just seems unfare and very dishonest that you charge people for an app they do not have anymore. Just want a refund for june and this month. Here is the 7 digit code 5400814 Sent from my iPhone","Refund! This app is a trap, even if you sign up for the free trial it will charge you!!!!"
1,2023-07-10 16:01:23,I had downloaded the app back in march of this year as a free trial. I decided I didn’t want to keep the app so I cancelled the subscription well in advance but recently discovered that my account was being charged almost $31.00 for the past 3 months plus I got charged $15.99 initially which I thought was a free trial. Multiple emails sent and no one is really helping. I was told that it was still showing active in their records but there is NOTHING on my end that shows I still have the app. VERY FRUSTRATED.

1,2023-07-08 11:17:23,"*EDITED WARNING* when the company responds, they are GASLIGHTING. I wish so badly I could add screenshots to this review!! Guys, I don’t ever write bad reviews because it makes me feel bad for the company but this is horrible! Read the latest reviews and stay away!  I was on the subscription page, past the part where I give info about myself, my body, my metabolism etc., and I minimized the app so I could check some things before going through with the payment of $20. I then got a notification from the app saying “limited offer.” Didn’t think anything of that, but pulled the app payment screen back up again and there was a pop-up there claiming I could now get it for $9.99, 50% off, one-time offer. I decide that I don’t want to pass that up and pay the $9.99. Then I find out it was 50% off of health coaching that I did not want (I have a screenshot of the original 50% offer that expresses nowhere that the offer is for something else other than what I thought I was paying for - very misleading). So I have to pay full $20 for the program I was interested in to begin with, on top of the $9.99 they slyly played me for. I’ll go to YouTube before I do apps like this. Be up-front when you’re trying to sell. Let your content speak for itself.","Super annoyed, deleting immediately."

Well, it turns out they renew it for you automatically. I canceled the automatic payment the same day I was charged, contacted customer service, and asked for a refund but was denied.

Decided to email, most companies,apple for sure , offer a refund in a case like this. Just like when my son accidentally charged my account for 100 dollars worth of you-gi-o coins.

When I checked  the account in the app, it was saying “Personalized Plan We've canceled your subscription, and you will not be charged in the future You can still access all of BetterMe until your current subscription ends”.   This morning, they tried to draw money out of the account. When I reached out, they explained that usually there would be additional steps to take to cancel the account (I checked the app and there was nothing; I searched for e-mails from them, nothing). Also they said that I might’ve signed on for something else after cancelling the membership. I did not.  Moreover, there is no program/membership active on the account. Plus, I would’ve remembered if I signed up for something; leave alone that I add events in my calendar when the payments are due when I join things like this, just to make sure that I have money available in that account.   They “cancelled” my membership this morning, but they won’t stop the payment that they charged without my permission. This is plain and simple theft.   Update:  After several e-mails back and forth this is what I received back.    “ Hello! Thank you for your response. Your satisfaction with our services means a lot to us. We have issued a refund for your charge in the amount of 53.04 USD. Just to let you know, the refund process usually takes 5-10 business days depending on the case.

You kinda become addicted to it. I was 142.4 at the start (1/22/23) - not a lot to start with, but now it’s 3/4/23 and I’m 131.4 - almost at my weight goal. Now, I used their suggested routine as a template, but on most days I did more than was required by plan: suggested calories were around 1600 a day, I tried to stay under 1000. Suggested calorie burn was around 550 a day, I tried to go above 1000. Do drink that water. Stay focused and you’ll get there. I’ve been trying to loose these freaking 15 pounds for years. Also, my fellow females, be aware that during PMS you most likely will gain weight out of thin air and it’s extremely frustrating. On those days I just wanted to give up… just don’t check your weight during that period and you’ll be ok :) The app does have a few bugs (the most frustrating was when daily educational stories got stuck on chapter 9 and never moved on from there - I liked reading those, while they lasted…)",It works if you stick to the plan

1,2023-02-26 18:32:57,"TL/DR: not worth the money. Get MyFitnessPal instead  I have been very successful in a ketogenic diet, but I wanted something to take me to the next level. Here are my issues:  1. There is no way to change the micros to a keto diet even though they offer meals and recipes for keto. Why log my calories if you say I’m over my fat content constantly?  2. No communication happened even though I emailed and sent messages/help requests in the app itself.  3. The meals rely too heavily on salads instead of other vegetables for greens.  4. For an app like this, you should not be forced to pay $15 just to see what it’s like. I feel a bit like I was tricked into spending money.  5. You can get everything you get from this app (and way better in my opinion) by simply using MyFitnessPal to log meals. If you really need a meal plan, I’d recommend reaching out to someone rather than using theirs.  6. As for the workouts, I’ve found YouTube to have just as good of exercises.",Use My FitnessPal instead

3,2022-12-07 12:44:19,I started out at $9.99 for three months which was a good test. I like the production values and the voices and the outfits and the diverse people showing you the exercises.

So I was charged a perfectly reasonable amount of $14.99  for the next three months but I did not want to continue.   it took three messages back-and-forth for me to get a refund and cancel my subscription. They are a bit too aggressive to try to get you to stay on the program.

1,2022-04-21 18:11:07,"I purchased this in January without really looking at the reviews. I should have. I never write reviews that aren’t positive in nature, but I feel compelled to share my experience with this app. Hopefully this feedback will help them to come up with a real solution.  I’ve been back and forth with this app’s customer service team multiple times over the past few months. Once about every 28-30 days to be exact. It seems that the app doesn’t have the space to hold data for longer than that amount of time. It begins to double up the information you’ve logged.  Not only that, you actually have to log something new in order to be able to delete the old information out. If you attempt to delete the information first, the app will freeze and you’re forced to close out the app and begin again.  Their solve is for you to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app every 28-30 days. You lose all of your data/progress info, and have to start everything over again.  At first, I thought it was just something on my end, but after doing this twice and reading some of the other reviews, I realized this was not an issue only I was having. Again, it seems there is only enough space for a certain amount of data before the app begins to malfunction.  During this last communication with the customer service team, they tried to tell me they could see that I hadn’t uninstalled and reinstalled the app (which I did do multiples times) in an attempt to get me to go through the same nonsense of uninstalling and reinstalling again.  I finally asked for a refund and was directed to speak with Apple because they can’t help me with that.  It’s already hard enough to have to be diligent about logging something into an app to try and track what’s going on with your health. The tracker itself shouldn’t be this difficult to use.  You can honestly do this for free in MyFitnessPal and it will track forever. I got sucked in by the exercise options, but once I signed up realized they weren’t the best either and went back to YouTube - also free.  Idk. If you find something you really have to have in this app, go for it, but I have yet to figure out what’s so great about it.

1,2022-02-12 23:26:34,"Where to start? First there are the exercise sets. I joined this based on its advertisement that it was Pilates. There are several supposed Pilates exercise videos but in fact they are highly repetitive, a 20 minute session consisting largely of three types of exercises repeated multiple times. They are not traditional Pilates exercises either. Then there is the calorie counter which is literally impossible. As an example they list two different values for 4 ounces of chicken thighs; one is 160 cal, the other is 264 cal. Possibly they may be differences in whether they're boneless, skinless, or have some additions, however they do not give any further information than chicken thigh 4 ounces.Two different calorie counts for ostensibly the same thing? Really? This is not an isolated case. Another to type in coffee. That one will get you supposedly 80 cal for a 6.7 ounce cup of coffee. Probably it's supposed to include sugar and or milk but they don't say! You cannot find out what the components are and you cannot change it for different additions nor ounces,  even if it were the correct count. After one session with it, I canceled. My advice is not to subscribe.",It is awful!

However they scam you into thinking you will be paying a very low price initially for the app. Then they tell you that you will be billed in a week at a discounted “19.99” unless you cancel your subscription (which can take 3-5 days processing…)—then they inform you the day of your renewal after the 7 days that you are getting charged 28$ (and they sent me the email ~after~ billing my account.)   What is not okay about this is that I explicitly had sent a message to the support team that I wanted to cancel before my 7 day trial and did not want to be billed/renewed for my subscription. They really quickly and kindly replied that they would cancel it and that I would not make any more payments.   Even though they said this I was billed. I have sent an email to them now to get my money back.   However I thought I would save people the trouble of even getting the app because it’s not worth it to go through the trouble of these payments. Seriously. Not worth it.

Which I did reply back, and decided to send pictures too and stated in great detail what happened and wanted to have them fix it at the time. Waited a few days for a response, which it states in their email that will contact you within 24hrs. Not the case here. In fact, I have sent multiple emails since October 2020 and have yet to hear back. I gave them the benefit of the doubt since I figured just busy or overwhelming clients. By the time I had, had enough and asked for a refund through Apple it was too late. Apple told me I had to get my refund through them. Didn’t know there was a time frame for that kind of thing? Have yet to get any responses back from Better Me. DO NOT BUY THE APP!! If you do and are not satisfied, do not go through them, go through APPLE right away! Wish I had known that sooner before I lost my money because I’m sure they will never respond back to me or refund my Money!!

It was supposed to be $29.99, but it would NOT register me until I clicked on some additional service which I thought I was getting for the same amount of money as “freebie”! Bam! I was charged another $12! I sent numerous requests for assistance, would receive a computer generated response that a live person would contact me.

But I went ahead and tried it for the special half off deal of $19.99.  But I’ve been charged $29.99 three times. I’ve contacted BetterMe via email asking for help signing in and also requesting a refund. Someone reached out but did not help with any of my concerns and has completely ignored me. I sent screen shots of my chargers and now I can’t even access my BetterMe account. Their customer service is horrible and the app is not worth it.

Please don’t download this, they steal your money. I contacted them and they’re refusing to answer me. I’m angry and upset and they literally stole money from my account and won’t cancel my subscription even though I’ve asked them to cancel my subscription multiple times.

I think the goal and content was good.   The meal planning could use some work.   Be sure to read the site carefully before you purchase.  It just wasn’t the right product for me.  I could see it could work well for others.   I signed up for this through my work who provided us a discount.  The cost was supposed to be $20 for semi annual subscription.   When I checked out from the app it did not show a total and I was charged $39.99 for six month subscription +$29.99 for a sign up offer.    I did not get this email confirmation until after I looked at the app.  One of the main features I wanted to use was the meal planning I like the idea of having my meals planned and a shopping list do you have everything laid out for me.   It was completely useless the shopping list did not provide quantities so you would have to go through every recipe to find out how much of everything you needed add it all up to go shopping.  This is way too time-consuming for some thing I’m paying for.     I contacted customer service and they were very responsive but claimed they couldn’t find my account which is understandable I use my work email for the discount and my personal email so I can put it on my personal phone.  Once I provided a copy of my invoice which was obviously substantially more than I was expecting to pay and the email address my account was under, radio silence.

4,2021-01-08 17:00:57,"First day with this app and am unimpressed.  I like the format but there are some serious fixes needed before it’ll be worth the $30 I paid for the year.  Meals: -It does not save meals, you’ll have to re-enter each meal that is not taken from the app. -The app meals seem to be a random assortment of dishes.  What is a good breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack?  Need to be better organized. -Bar code scanner has a very limited library & have to enter most foods manually.   -Why are ounces the only available measurement when all our food is in grams?  I have to convert everything I eat.  Since I gave to manually enter most of the food, this slows the process.  Workouts: -The warm ups need to be longer.  They tend to be about 2 minutes of ballistic stretching, then, boom, right into the workout.   -Workouts are about15 to 20 minutes.  Though that can be good if intense enough, these are.  Pick your level & if you’re in very good shape, do 2.  The app gets an extra star because of the workouts. -Oh, and the sound, there isn’t any.  If you’re not looking at your phone you won’t know when to switch exercises.  A ding, buzzer, voice, something...anything to let you know when to switch.  There are challenges which can focus on abs or diet or other areas which are an extra cost.  Another $10-20 seems odd as I just paid $30 for the app to eat better & exercise.  Now if I want a particular diet or exercise plan I have to pay more?  Foul.  This app has good potential but needs a solid update or two.  Update:   I stopped using the app for a little while & recently restarted.  I regularly use the diet diary which has serious accuracy issues.   Example:  -I ate 1.5 cups of Cheerios (a single serving & 140 calories).   -The app asks only for ounces (1.5 cups = 12 ounces).   -The app calculates 12 ounces as 1276 calories (1 ounce is calculated as 106 calories (should be 12 calories)).   This apparent confusing of “ounces” as “servings” is common.  I find I have to fine tune the number of ounces to reflect what I ate (1.4 ounces is calculated as 146 calories).  It’s a real pain.",Potential is high.  Performance is...meh.

After looking at these charges, I realized it did the same thing in October. I do not have two of the same app!

2,2021-01-02 14:49:40,It’s a great concept but honestly you’re better off just watching YouTube videos for free. You have to pay for just about everything.

This happens 99 percent of the time and I have to use my smaller android device because I never get that message. It gives me only ONE option for a subscription and will not click out of he message. Third, on certain workouts it freezes at the rest cycle of the workout and it will not save any progress. The app says I am only a few workouts in when I have done A LOT more then what it says.

So on November 18th I received confirmation from Monica that my subscription had been canceled. Well low and behold November 27th they took out another payment AFTER I had already CANCELLED IT.

2,2020-12-01 23:30:28,"Update: After leaving this bad review someone from the company finally responded to me. In that time I got charged for a third time at the $9.99/ wk subscription. They refunded me for 2 of the 3 charges.  When I signed up through Facebook it said there was a money back guarantee. I am updating my review from 1 to 2 stars solely because I got a partial refund, plus the company asked me to. I still don’t recommend this app solely because it is almost impossible to get a hold of anyone and it doesn’t seem like they hold up on refunding your full purchase if you’re not satisfied.   I found this app through a Facebook advertisement. I liked the quiz they had to “build” your own personalized plan. When I completed the quiz it suggested getting their app, which I did, and then paying $9.99 for my plan. There wasn’t any wording past that about it being weekly or monthly. I figured it was monthly or a one-time thing.  I started using the app and didn’t feel like it was all that different than other workout apps. The only things that set it apart are the quick access to trainers for questions and the articles. I also like the fasting timer. Aside from that tracking meals is  more difficult than other apps that have a larger data base to pull from. I found I had to manually add a lot of my food.  After having the app for a week I noticed a new $9.99 charge. So I went through their help section to create a ticket to ask why I got charged again. I guess the $9.99 subscription is weekly for “meal plans”. The recipes looked good for the meal plan but not worth $9.99/wk, which is over $500/yr. That seems a little much for something that is generated through an app. Anyways they responded quickly the first day, which was a Friday and then I didn’t hear back after 5pm. Which I figured maybe they work 9am-5pm Mon-Fri and I would hear something on Monday.  Today is Monday and I never heard anything back from them. I started a new ticket to try to cancel the membership and if I don’t hear anything back by tomorrow evening I will be calling Apple to get all my money back. Save yourself the hassle and find a more trustworthy company.  Update for developers: Here are my ticket numbers you have asked for. 494235, 488697 and 479754  Clearly this has been an issue that hasn’t been resolved and that’s why I keep contacting the company. Each time I start a new ticket I get an automated response with an ID number and it says I will be contacted within 8 hours by a human. Obviously that hasn’t happened....",Marketing is unclear with subscription cost
1,2020-12-01 13:40:58,It’s impossible to cancel your subscription. I’ve reached out for weeks and have not received a response. I started with the free trial and was charged $29.99 with no way to cancel. Not worth it!!!,Canceling Your Subscription Is Impossible
1,2020-11-30 17:34:40,These are not as “personalized” as they lead you to believe. The exercises can easily be found on YouTube or any free exercise app. Definitely not worth the money and very unprofessional and ineffective when trying to cancel your membership.,Very dissatisfied

I did a survey asking what types of foods I liked so the meal plan would be catered to me.  A lot of the items I said I didn’t like where included in the plan.   I did change my rating from a one star to a three because they are timely to respond to emails and refunded my entire subscription fees (483629),Scam
1,2020-11-18 14:19:35,I have sent a message every day for the past 4 days asking for my free trial to be canceled and no one ever responds back. I have now been charged $29.99 for a months subscription and STILL can not get anyone to respond to my numerous cancel subscription requests and there’s no other way to cancel besides submitting a ticket. I have never in my life had requests completely ignored from an app or subscription. DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS! It has to be a scam! Now I will have to cancel my credit card so they don’t charge me $30 every month.,They refuse to cancel your free trial

I subscribed to the plan for 3 months! Said $29.99 each month but a total of $60 so Iam confused! As you go thru they keep asking you to pay more?  Then I go  & start  exploring app, water recording is not bad( if you make a mistake forget it!) but what really blew my mind was the food tracker takes a LONGGG TIME IS NOT PEOPLE FRIENDLY I had this morning an omelette with ORGANIC GIRL ( baby spring mix) is a simple request. How can this app not have something so simple and used across a diet ON their food LIST!!! I had written a message thru the app itself, whoever answered  by the name of WADE??? said my subscription been canceled AND I will still be able to use it until expired but my question is why do I have to make ALL 3 payments when I AM NOT HAPPY AND WONT BE USING IT!!! Then I wrote a second message but NOBODY  HAD ANSWERED .  This is the worst customer service, you are intentionally doing this ! I will write reviews every where I know Bcs is awful  and you are taking people $ without any shame !!!!",Not what it seems like!!!
1,2020-11-13 19:04:16,I reached out on several platforms letting them know I wanted to cancel my subscription within the 7 day period. They also charged 25.99 to my card in addition to the $1 cost for the 7 day trial. Once I talked about it they asked me to download several apps and let them know why I cancelled the app instead of making the adjustment.,If you don’t like the app they will ignore you

They offered to extend my subscription for another 6 months or give me 30% off of some unknown service.",Can I give negative stars??
1,2020-11-05 08:01:32,"I wanted to  like this app despite the Most Helpful Reviews ‘warnings’ I proceeded and signed up for the free trial, and within 30 minutes (literally) I was canceling my free trial to avoid being charged for an app with severely limited functionality. Needless to say the reviews (Most Helpful) are spot on and I agree with them on the noted aspects (severely limited food library, limited serving annotation options, fasting countdown restrictive). As far as the food library is concerned, like a previous reviewer stated, the main unit of measure for food is ounces or grams. This is totally ridiculous, for example I logged in a slice of bread, it was recorded as 28 grams, most ppl eat bread by the slice NOT the gram 😳. The Fasting feature is a locked function, so if I forgot to ‘start’ the fast in the app, I’m stuck with the time that I pressed the button.  The same holds true to extending my fast, occasionally I may extend my fast by an hour or so, unfortunately I can’t change the time to reflect this.   What I did like about the app: Tips for the Day, Water Tracker( when it worked), Guided Exercise (when it worked).   Now continuing with the Cons: Other areas that I feel needs work are as follows:   The Coach feature: I get having scripted automated responses upon your initial interaction with the app; however I was experiencing some technical issues and reached out to ‘Support’ and they recommended that I delete and reload the app. It also informed me that my information would not be lost, as long as I did not attempt a synch prior to the reload. I did as directed and I did not lose my information which was synced with my iWatch; however, I lost all of my meal entries, and my daily Streak days within the app, so I went from 14 days back to Day 1, as of this writing I’m now back on Day 3. Furthermore to add insult to injury, the ‘initial’ Coach scripted remarks started all over again! 🙄🤦‍♀️👎 The Coach has also on occasion contradicted itself, in one instant my tip for the day was to have an avocado toast, but in another session it’s telling me to avoid bread, which one is it?🤔 I also lost my dashboard where the following trackers are no longer available: Workout, Meals, Walk, and Water tracker. Yet I continue to receive notifications to log my meals, and record my workouts, of which I can’t.  In order to log my meals I would need to ‘purchase’ this feature 👎. This leads me to believe that you will only have the dashboard options available to you IF you purchase the full version of the app. Not worth the special offer of $29.99 yearly. The dashboard should also offer an option to ‘self-check off’ the tasks for the day, though my daily caloric allowance was 1345 calories doesn’t mean that I’m going to necessarily eat that for the day. If I only eat 1200 calories for the day, then the app should allow you to check the radio button denoting that you’ve finished eating for the day. Also if I work out for 15 minutes instead of 30, then so be it and let me close the task out. Recommend that the dashboard features incorporate an edit option.   The Challenges: I signed up for the 21-day sugar free challenge for $10 (plus .81 tax). I figured that I’ve wasted money on lesser things so why not give it a shot. BUT, If you forget to select the “success” or “epic fail” button for the day; you’re just out of luck as there isn’t an option to edit this information.    The insidious and unrelenting marketing. I understand that app developers have to earn an income, but can you say ‘overkill’. You’ll receive notifications 2-3 times a day offering you a ‘gift’, ‘special offer’ ‘challenge’ or the ‘unread message’ icon will attempt to coheres you into purchasing the full version of the app.   So I must say that I gave it a fair shake (17 days), or according to the app Day 3. Deleting now...","Hey, I tried...👎"
1,2020-11-04 07:00:42,"Don’t waste your time or money. I never even used the app. I was charged $29.99 initially which to my belief was for a year. Then a month later I was charged an additional $29.99 for a “subscription”  that I never signed up for.  I contacted the company and told them that I didn’t use the app and didn’t sign up for any subscriptions. I showed them a screenshot of my active subscriptions showing I didn’t sign up for a subscription. They offered me a year of the app instead of a refund. I said no, I didn’t use the app and want my money back. They offered half of my money back. I then showed them a screenshot showing in the information for their app out states $29.99 for a 3 month subscription. I told them it had been 1 month, that if they do not refund my money I would report them to the BBB, Paypal and Apple. They said they could give me 1/2 off of what I paid. I told them technically 1/2 off is $29.99 since I was charged twice. They finally refunded me one of the $29.99. They are extremely penny pinching company and dishonest trying to charge people extra.","Scam, charges you randomly extra"

1,2020-10-30 11:31:41,The only thing I like about this app are the walking workouts. It’s difficult to track food...most items are not recognize by the bar code scanner and the portion sizes are impossible to adjust. Everything defaults to 3.53 ounces. Who drinks 3.5 ounces of coffee creamer or ears 3.5 ounces of peanut butter? The tracking feature needs a lot of work on this app. Also I just paid $29.99 and I’m getting constant ads for challenges that cost extra. What is that about?? I will be cancelling this app. Very disappointed.,Difficult app to use
1,2020-10-28 17:12:05,This is completely unethical on the app developer’s end to try to maximize their profits. Any additional click or feature may result in an additional $29.99 charge. Just ridiculous.,Every click is an extra charge
1,2020-10-27 15:05:54,they charge extra for every challenge/workout so buying the app is worthless. save your $$$ just go to youtube for workout programs,useless app
5,2020-09-30 13:55:33,"I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life. I’ve tried dozens of apps and I’ve stuck to none of them. I decided to try BetterMe after seeing an ad for it on YouTube. I typically do not pay for these types of services bc I have a hard time justifying the money BUT maybe having some skin in the game might make me stick to it, or at least I hope. I bought the $30, 12 week program and so far, I love it. I love that it’s an all in one weight loss app. Food, weight, exercise and water tracking all right there. What does it for me especially, is the planned workouts. I’m not very active and have bad knees, so being able to choose walking for my workouts gives me ease of mind. Seeing my workout for the day is a 15 or 20 minute fast walk doesn’t stress me out, it gets me excited bc I know I can do it and I won’t be miserable trying to run or do full body workouts that may not be for me. I’m glad I can take a laid back, simple approach to losing the weight. I also enjoy the workout audio guides. I can listen to my music and it interrupts to tell me when to start speed walking and for how long. Such a simplified way to walk without focusing on it. I’m really enjoying this app and I’m hoping in 12 weeks I’ve reached my fitness goal. I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a straightforward system to get healthy.","New to BM, but impressed!"
1,2020-10-22 22:57:30,This app is awful. They make you pay for so many key features. I paid an extra 19 dollars for the “personal trainer” and  that’s not a personal trainer. That is a robotic person or a literal robot who is not motivating or encouraging at all like how I would imagine a trainer to be. The app asked me twice for my meal plan. Both times I put vegetarian and specified I do not eat eggs. Tell me why in my meal plan they put eggs! That situation plus the robotic “trainer” made me not even want to explore the app. Pretty sure I spent like 30 dollars on this app. It’s already not free but then I paid extra for the useless “trainer.” I really should have read the reviews before I purchased this app but I saw it advertised on YouTube and genuinely thought it would motivate me to loose weight.,BEWARE! Waste of money!
1,2020-10-19 03:24:16,I rarely review apps but this one is one of the worst. They offer a free trial but then almost everything in the app requires a purchase. I canceled the day they charged me 29.99 and they refused to give me a refund.  I would not recommend this app.,App is not good
1,2020-10-18 23:38:44,"This app is ridiculous. It’s a money pit. Once you pay the app will open options like “get your meal plan” which I thought my subscription already payed for, but nope.

Again mentions nothing about the BetterMe app. Then they send you an email confirming your $20 you just spent with the link showing now u will be using the better me app. You open the app the options are GENERIC. It’s basically the free app version of any app before buying any add-ons. Sooo I just paid $20 to enter the app lol. Nothing personalized AT ALL. Keto only diets.

I asked for answers to my question of what did I upgrade to and o got the response that I would get an answer to my questions within the week.... no one ever answered me. This was back in August. Still have never received a response plus I gave money and nothing new was added.....  You’re response to my review is not helpful at all!

First days meals had lunch and dinner menu with fish. I stated on the questionnaire that I don’t eat fish or tofu. I continued to look on day 2 and there was fish and tofu on this day. I sent an email to the customer support and was told that they couldn’t see where I placed the no fish and no tofu on my profile so they suggested I delete that app and reinstall it to reset it. After a few emails back and forth I asked if they would reset it to make sure I wasn’t charged for the app again, so they did. I went through the whole process again to chose my fitness goals and food choices and saved the info and once again my menu has fish and tofu on it!

The app even asked me foods I would like to incorporate. I was hopeful! Then I pulled up my first days meals and my balloon deflated! I got my hopes up again though when I saw I could change my meal options. I started to scroll through my choices, and scroll and scroll and scroll...and this was just breakfast!! There were foods on there I hadn’t even heard of and wouldn’t even know where to shop for them!!

I was charged for the initial month and that I “selected” (through complete confusion I’ll add) an additional add-on for $9.99. Ok, sooo...where did the extra $14.99 come from then? I’m still waiting for a response.   Here’s the take away...I’m a busy mom with 3 active kids and I’m just trying to lose weight and get healthy like many others. I figured out that this program was in fact not for me, within the first week of downloading. They do GUARANTEE results. When you sign up online, you pay and get prompted to download the app. THEN you get prompted again, but it’s a little confusing, I thought I was then selecting the option I had already selected online, just now in the app. It’s no surprise though, apps and companies like this do these things all the time to just nickel and dime us consumers.

You can’t get help with anything and it’s all self serve.. I paid for have limited access to an application and no help.. I want my money back  **Update*** I received a reply back to my review to send an email, an email was sent before I wrote the review and still NO response to that email, so what’s the resolution. Still no access and you have my money still. Am I to continue to write emails with no responses.. just DON’T download this app",Not worth it
1,2020-09-18 05:31:39,Was never able to log into the app had $1 taken out with some unknown company named memotre after I was told nothing would be taken out of my account that I still had no access to another $39.99 was taken out of my account and don’t even have anybody to talk to about it,Scam
1,2020-09-17 16:54:31,Just a tip of advice for anyone who believes what they promise in the premium version. I paid the $29.99 for it and my account hasn’t changed one bit from the free to premium. I requested a refund and was told it was a non refundable item and I should have read the terms. No apologies no trying to fix things just took my money and have been nothing but rude about the matter. The premium version is a complete scam for anyone considering it. Extremely disappointed.,Do not buy the premium version!!
1,2020-09-17 15:17:08,"I decided to try this app on Monday and today is Thursday. First I thought I got a free trial which I didn't... so I was charged &29.99 for ONE month! I contacted customer service and got a very lagging response and questioned why I got no free trial. They said oh you signed up for a month when on the website I clicked the try free button. Okay- fast forward to Wednesday... I contacted them because I do not like some of the meal options. They gave me instructions that I went to follow but not all the buttons were there. I contacted them AGAIN with more pictures explaining I do not have the buttons I should to change things. Then they contacted me back saying I'm logged out when I'm not. Also trying to ""unsubscribe"" is a hassle. The website kept kicking me out and saying error on their side. So I had to email multiple times saying that I wanted to unsubscribe. To top off poor customer service, they keep referring to me as girl...not by my name! So I feel like this app is a money scam. Horrible experience to the point where I won't use the app but to each their own I guess.",Major fail! Not worth the money and poor customer service.
3,2020-09-11 11:34:03,Update: Although it took a bit to hear back from customer service on cancelling my subscription. It was pleasant and quick correcting my issue once contact was made.  6 digit number received was 337161,Not for me
1,2020-09-16 18:20:32,I paid $30 for a year subscription. They let me use the app for 3 months and now I cannot get logged in. They say I don’t have an account!! I have reached out to them and spoke and cannot get any help for either! When the app did work it was not great . There are way better apps out there and they don’t cost anything or nearly as much!

When I realized this, I immediately reached out to Better Me and  wanted to cancel and get a refund, I was told no. After asking for several days (4) to be exact, they are now offering 1/2 of my money back.   I contacted them within a 1/2 hour of purchasing the plan. After downloading their app, going through it, seeing that at every turn in it, I am asked to purchase something in order to use it. This, after spending $29.99?!   I know $29.99 is not a great deal of money, but it’s the principal. If you want a great diet/weight loss app/plan? I would encourage you to look elsewhere. This simply is not it.",Felt like a rip off from get go

We even tried contacting the CEO. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN RESPONSE. Terrible customer service.   While I did leave comments on their Instagram, I did see that this has happened to a number of people. People who haven't been replied to, people who have been scammed, people who called them thieves. This is unjust and fraud.

2,2020-09-12 00:56:19,"One thing I really loved about this app is that the workouts were separated by levels as well as the type of workout you were doing. That version was so much more efficient and for me, much less confusing and intimidating once I started working out at home. Now the workouts are thrown in whatever category and there’s no section for walking/running anymore. I really enjoy this app but at this point I might as well go back to youtube.",Terrible since the update.
3,2020-09-08 13:17:05,"Update: I was contacted by customer service who handled the problem.   I signed up for an extended plan through their website, not via an in-app purchase/subscription. Logging meals was more difficult in this app than others and I have tried to contact customer service multiple times within the app to cancel the subscription. I have received no response.

Do not fall for it: (1) I NEVER got my “personalized fasting plan” as it was advertised and promised, after I signed up.  (2) I signed up with a different email address than my Apple ID and now I can’t cancel my subscription.  (3) Tried to get in touch with customer service 3 weeks ago, regarding my subscription, and no one has followed up yet.

5,2020-09-03 16:03:22,"I’ve been using this app for about a week and have found that I hate it more than I like it.  All in all, I’ve already canceled my subscription but locked myself into the 3 month plan so hopefully they make huge improvements during that time!  If they are going to provide a meal plan, the meal plan nutritional information should already be in the catalog for me to just click on, instead of inputting each micronutrients individually.  I have a keto lifestyle but the meals provided will take me out of ketosis, they should do a better job of vetting the meals before adding them as part of the plan.  Also, because the nutritional database is so limited, the bar scan is almost useless; I’ve had to “add meal” more often than not.  Additionally, the 20 min workouts are not worth the money.  There is no audible cue that lets you know you’re moving from one workout to the next so I’m stuck staring at my phone pretty much the entire time.  There is no real explanation of each move which could easily result one someone hurting themselves.  Additionally, I paid for the live coach feature but the only time “the coach” checked in was to invite me to a workout challenge that costed an additional $10 on top of what I paid for the 3 month subscription!    Also, the layout of the app is not the best, or maybe there are still some bugs to be worked out.  I fast from 9pm til 1pm but there is no alarm or reminder to use the fasting option daily and it doesn’t start/stop on its own.  This would be a great feature to add for those new to fasting.  The app is minimal at best.  Lastly, in the box used to provide feedback, there is no autocorrect.  This isn’t the biggest issue, but if I’m taking the time to provide useful feedback, the least the app could do is make it as easy as possible for me.",The potential is there but not worth the current price
1,2020-09-07 20:58:19,"There is no human on the other side. No customer support even to answer a simple question.

1,2020-09-06 11:36:14,The app has charged me $29.99 despite the fact that I have not used it once. I have subscribed accidentally and they informed me that I am not eligible for a refund.,No refund

Once their food database is fully loaded with items, it will be awesome!  So when I first started the app, last week, it was awesome.  I love that it has food plan laid out for you, with an easy add to shopping list. I lost 3 #s my first week.  Now, I am locked out of the food plans, it keeps wanting me to restore purchases too. Right before the food locked, it wasn’t logging my food either. And some other minor things, like trying to log your calories by doing a search. Example- the recipe is called Cod with Italian beans casserole. You won’t t find it if you start the search with cod, or with Italian beans. I found it under Italian bean casserole.  Plus whatever I am able to log, when I look at the profile, my calorie intake is double.  I have emailed and haven’t had a response. 316336.  This could be a great app!!

Strangely, the subscription in my phone claims that BetterMe has never changed me any money. The balance in my iPhone says $0.00. However, this is NOT true. $39.99 was taken out of my bank account and went to BetterMe. This discrepancy seems very shady to me.  To top it off, there is NO cancel subscription option in my iPhone settings for this app. I have no way to cancel the subscription.

So it was important to me to find an app geared towards beginners with exercises that didn't need special equipment and could be done at home. I came across BetterMe app and decided to give it a go. In my opinion, it is way more affordable than regular sessions with a personal trainer or nutritionist. Not gonna lie, I was a bit skeptical about the workouts since I’m a total beginner. Each workout (I started with those targeting butt and arms) was super intense but doable. The app provides detailed workout, nutrition, and body measurement planning, tracking, and analysis.  Meal plans are super customizable and I really like that. As someone with too many dietary restrictions, I loved that I could select specific ingredient to leave out.

The app told me how many calories I needed to achieve my goals, but the foods for the entire day were not meeting that. The calories for the meals they provided were significantly less than what my goals were. I feel the plan is too expensive for me to have to work on a plan that was supposed to be provided.

2,2020-07-24 17:29:35,"This app is wack. It’s so unfair I paid a year subscription but cannot access ANYTHING. I keep logging on and it says it can’t find my subscription. When I try to restore purchases it doesn’t work either.

I am using the same account with same email and password where the purchase was made. I only use the app on one phone at a time so that’s not a problem. But On my iPhone, It rarely works for a few days and then goes weeks saying I never paid and the cycle continues.

Unfortunately this fix only lasted for a few hours before the same problem occurred again, and I am now back to not having access to my plan or meals.  I have submitted multiple tickets to support but have no idea when I will receive a response. In the meantime I have a subscription that I paid for that I can’t use. Very frustrating - be warned.

I emailed the company from which my charge came, they answered and said they only process payments, and  I’ll have to go back to company.  Luckily I paid for it with PayPal, so once I show them My attempt to get refund the same day and that app does not work as advertised, they will get back my 42.00  Know I know why you don’t pay in app, because they would have to refund customers money without sending them in a wild goose chase, that most people will give up on.","Not good, what they advertise is not what you get."
1,2020-06-22 22:23:08,This app is not good if you have very good eating habits and are just looking for something to track your food and exercise. It won’t let you log in any workouts done on a bicycle. Most foods on the scanner automatically pop up with a weird and non realistic serving size of 3.53????? almost everything is measured in oz when sometimes measurements of cups may make more sense. You receive messages throughout the day telling you to make sure you don’t overeat and in my case most of the time I was well under the daily calories suggested. They are working on updating things but it felt like it’s still a work in progress that was quite possibly released too early. Very very very disappointed,Austin 78702

1,2020-06-01 17:59:23,"I got this because it was going to have meal plans... but riddle me this. WHAT is the point of having the plan if when you make it, the food doesn’t go to the food log? AND why can’t you search the recipes when you are trying to log the recipe. If I’m responsible for logging each item in the recipe, then that is something I am already doing and don’t need them weird recipes. Also I think it’s ridiculous there isn’t a way to change you meal plan and select from a favorites menu or something. Clearly it’s not rearranging the meals based on other selections and your macros. If it did, it wouldn’t have selected me to have 3 meals that supposed to have a max of 50g fat but really was 76g.  So to sum it up... the meal plans are in fact planned, but you can’t log them, they are not curated to your specific “plan”, and you can’t even search or find things you favorited before.  What happened is I was duped into a 3month plan of 29.99 and all I have to show is some weird recipes that use measurements like 1/5cup. Who is the heck uses that? Use grams or oz like a normal person. No one has a 1/5c measuring device. It’s just dumb. Ugh. I’m so mad at myself!",What is the point

2,2019-11-18 03:38:25,"This app is pretty great if you have a pantry and fridge full of ingredients to make the recipes they offer through the app. There is no way to enter your own food as you might be able to do on apps like MyFitnessPal. This app offers you an array of meals for your personalized fitness plan but unless you are making those exact meals you cannot track what you are eating. Paying $50/year for a bunch of workouts is not worth it considering you can find them for free on YouTube and Pinterest.   Another downside is that you cannot enter your own daily calorie goal. It sets the goal for you and in my opinion it sets it too high. It does adjust calories (more for workout days and less for non-workout days), but again, not worth the money. You pay for the exercise plan and have to use another app for food tracking.",Do NOT purchase. There is no way to enter food!

Loved howbI had the short little workouts. Then after an update it was completely different. After 3 workouts it said rest day and all new workouts were locked and required more money to used. It has been “rest day” for weeks!!! So I am paying $20 a month to log my water intake  because that is all it will let me do. I cancelled.,Disappointed
5,2019-07-24 01:08:16,Love this app it has workouts that u can find on YouTube but they are all in separate sections which makes it soo much easier to find.After I’m done with my workout I feel great and I’m ready for tomorrow’s!!!!🌸👍,Great 👍

By July 20th, 2019 i was charged for a monthly subscription for $10.77, then charged $10.77 AGAIN on July 27th, 2019. I’m livid.

1,2019-08-15 13:28:05,"I almost feel like this app takes advantage of some people. I’m referring to those who would do anything/ pay anything to lose weight. And I get it. This app is claiming to have these varieties of exercises but, these are workouts almost everyone is already familiar with. Stuff that you can google or look up on YouTube.  Do yourself a favor and get on Instagram! There are so many trainers or normal every day people who post up their workouts and diet programs for FREE.",You do NOT need this app.

1,2019-08-13 13:54:59,"My experience with this app was noting but horrible and frustrating.   I saw an ad for it on Pinterest and wanted to download to check out if it offers anything more than the workout app I currently have.   During the download process it asked for me to authorize the download. And then I think it asked me to acknowledge the TOS.  When I was trying to I acknowledge it, the screen was frozen. So I put my thumb on the Home button just hoping to get through that step.  After a second or two, there’s a spinning wheel that kept spinning and spinning...  when it’s done spinning it displayed a message saying something about a charge of $119+.  I was like “WHAT???”   I removed my thumb as fast as I could but the screen went away already before I had a chance to read it.   I was like “hell No!  I hope I didn’t just get charged!”   I checked my bank right away but didn’t see a charge.  I thought ok maybe that was just a glitch.   I then downloaded the app and took a look at it.   The workout routine it offered was just some pictures with descriptions in writing on how to do each pose.  I was thinking wow this is pretty crude.  All the other workout applications I downloaded have at least video clips showing how to do each routine.  Who has time to read through text to learn to do a workout?   So I closed the app and never used it.   A couple of days later I found out I was charged $129.89 for a yearly subscription for this app.  I do not know it was a technical glitch or a deliberate design, they charged me $119+ tax upfront without offering me a chance to read or select payment options.  I would have denied it for sure for something trying to charge me upfront without giving me a chance to try.  That was the start of the nightmare.  I then tried to go to the app to find someone to chat.  The chat window didn’t work and always showed the advisors were offline.  I read through their help trying to find a way to cancel and get a refund but what they told you you could cancel from your account was a lie.  There’s no option to cancel from within the app.   I then tried to cancel the subscription from iPhone settings.  It said if I cancel I have another year to enjoy the app.  I did not want another year!  I wanted to just cancel and get a refund for an app I never used and never will given the bad experience.   I then tried again from the app and finally was able to find someone on the chat.  This time he sent me a link to ask for refund from the App Store.  I followed the link and requested a refund.  Two days later I didn’t hear back anything.  So I went to that link again and submitted another request for refund.  This time I got an instant response on the screen saying sorry I was not qualified for an refund.  I had to go out my of way to finally foind an apple support number to call and told them my whole experience with the download and charge without offering me a chance to read and  decline the charge.  Thank goodness the apple support lady was very nice and listened to me.  She told me she had similar complaints about this exact app.  She gave me the refund back.  That was a lot of time wasted just trying to get a refund for something I do not want.  Be aware if you want to try this app.   Make sure you read through the TOS very carefully and make sure you do not accidentally authorize a charge thinking you are just authorizing a free download.",Be Aware!

3,2019-05-20 02:13:11,"When looking at the app description for some reason I thought there would be more questions about my body type and issues. They give 4 issues, I think they’re: flabby arms, saggy breasts, flabby tummy and thick thighs. I also thought it would be more tied together. There is a workout section and you choose which category of workout you’d like to pursue (abs vs butt vs general fit- that kind of thing). With the food they give you several categories to choose from, I think they were: normal, gluten-free, vegetarian, Keto and one more I can’t remember. Then the calendar comes up and each day you get three meals and two snacks.  Recommendations for Better Me: In the calendar each week has certain items that are used throughout- so you aren’t shopping for a little but if this and that  Highlight one or two categories of exercise you recommend to start with  When you open the calendar/menu for the first time have a introduction into that type of eating with tips. There should definitely be a list of staple replacements such as (and again I’m making up the details in the examples): white rice -> brown rice Or quinoa ... milk chocolate -> dark chocolate. There should be a list basics and supplements.   This is a big one- give TIPS throughout as quick to read pop-ups that relate to what we’re looking at. For example- when exercise comes up say “go easy to start if you aren’t used to working out. For the first few days limit yourself to 15 min max.”(I made that obviously but you get the point). If I felt you were watching over me and the app felt like a friend I would feel more obligated plus I would have my hand held. And of course you can have a setting that turns them off if you want. You could even have fun facts pop-up like “Ketosis is a normal metabolic process. When the body does not have enough glucose for energy, it burns stored fats instead.”  Anyway, thanks for a nice looking, easy to use app. I do like that it is uncomplicated.

1,2019-04-02 06:14:27,"So I started the app as usual and when it got to the plan part I did not see a free trial button. But I had seen good stuff about it and I liked that it had meal plans. But when I read the subscription that said it was $2 and some odd cents a week, in total $119.99 for the year. So I thought great! It’ll be the $2 and something a week I can handle that. But no it took out of my account the full $119.99 out of my account. Thankfully Apple was kind enough to refund me but it’s still very frustrating and misleading how they put it. Also as I read other reviews it seems that it only does the 28 days? So my question is why have the whole year package that I WAS excited for only last 28 days? Anyways I liked the idea of it but hated how it doesn’t have a free trial and how it’s misleading when it came to subscriptions.",If I could give a zero I would.

I know that everything in life isn’t for free. But, for women that’s trying too workout and lose the weight or trying new things in there workout it’s very sad too say this is the app for people who wants too feel comfortable in there own skin, and i think that women can agree when I say this is the app for them.Keep up the good work and honestly this is my personal opinion.",Best App Ever But I Wish It Was Free🤷🏾‍♀️

Literary active until April and apparently nothing I can do about it. Not like I am getting charged a small amount like a $1. I have been charged $60, $54.99, $9.99 all these varying amounts it is absolutely insane. This app is a scam and be very careful to even give it a shot & even download it- like I did because apparently you sign some contact to make it able to charge you for so long, so upset as you can tell.

Next thing I know, I’m being billed $41.99 for their “Premium Subscription” (not even $9.99 for a 1 month subscription). There is NO indication on how to cancel until you come HERE ( to the 1 star reviews) where they share with you that you have to cancel through your Apple account.

1,2019-02-09 00:29:57,This app charged me 83.49 within 30 days for the same 6 month subscription. I selected monthly  billing and they still took out the  6 month subscription twice. I could not even use the app because I had to delete it. This is absolutely unacceptable. They do not have enough choices for different diets. The workout options are just 4 places to target. This app needs to be developed so that it is not taking money from people and also providing more resources for the price.,This app deserves to be shut down

Of course they didn’t put my subscription the cheapest package, it was the highest and I never authorized that. If I would’ve known that I would later get charged $45.22 I probably wouldn’t have gotten the app. Also I should have at least gotten an email saying that my renewal was up and I would’ve canceled it then. I am so upset and I would like a refund. This isn’t fair to me or anyone that has had it happen to.

I’m not sure if the exercises reset at all because they look the same.

5,2018-07-16 19:59:44,This app charged me 41.99 and I was only trying to check it out for one month. Instead it charged me for an entire 6 months 🤬🤬🤬🤬,Outrageous
5,2018-07-15 13:20:27,"Let me tell you what—I have been up and down the scale more than I can say and I’ve done so many workout apps and calorie counting apps and this one is BY FAR the BEST app I’ve ever encountered. It’s so simple! Every other app is has so much to them; layers and layers of calorie counting, workouts that I’ve never even heard of, nutritional servings out the butt (I literally don’t need to know anything other than calories consumed and calories burned, otherwise I’ll go insane at the amount of mono and poly saturated crap etc., I’m consuming and get hella burnt out).  This app gives you workouts that anyone can do and you start out easy! I’m incredibly out of shape and even the beginner workouts get me huffing and puffing but they give you the option to pause during a workout which is such a necessity in my position and as such I don’t feel pressured to get a workout done and not feel good about finishing it. It allows me to finish in my own time and at my own pace. The meal planning. OH the meal planning. I’ve tried and tried and tried to plan meals for weeks even months in advance and I fail to go further than a week. Better Me generates meal plans for MONTHS ahead! It’s a dream come true! They give you the option of any dietary restrictions you may have (I’m gluten intolerant) and if you don’t really care for the foods they list out, you can choose to keep the ones you do like and regenerate a new set of recipes daily! It’s amazing. I can’t get enough words out to express how everyone should at LEAST take a chance with this app. It’s definitely better than I could have imagined and even though I moan and groan about the workout reminders every morning, they’re right when they say 80% of people who set reminders to workout ACTUALLY do it! I feel guilty if I don’t and then I have to go and actually delete the notification so I’ll end up seeing it anyways. Way to go Better Me! Thank you for reaching out to the people who can’t even CrossFit their shoelaces without wanting to die.",Best workouts!
3,2018-06-29 09:59:20,The exercises are very good and I am enjoying doing it.My concern is to know the calories in each meal you put it in your application. This will help me to control my weight more. I hope you will  add this issue soon .Thanks,Need a calorie counting
1,2018-07-13 00:11:54,I only downloaded the app to check it out and it automatically charged me $41.99 for subscription that I was unaware of and I didn’t find out for 2 months ( did not look at my cc statement),HORRIBLE!!!! Charged me for subscription when I only downloaded the APP!!!!
1,2018-07-12 21:38:50,"I downloaded the app because I decided to start exercising. The app was alright, so I tried the free trial. I realized I wasnt using it, so I cancelled my trial.

1,2018-07-11 14:17:25,"I should have read more of the reviews before selecting “7 day free trial” I decided to give this app a try, but before I even got to the gym to give it a go, I was alerted my bank that a charge was taken out for $41.99, I was instantly charged when I believed I was doing the free trial! I canceled my subscription immediately, but the charge is still placed. I’d like my full refund, I’m disappointed to say the least. My other opinion on the app as I was browsing through, there’s not many options for meals, and when they ask for a preference they only give you a vegetarian option, I feel like if you are charging over $10 for this app you need more variety because every user is different, this goes for when your picking your “problem” areas as well... not worth it. Please get back to ASAP, or I’ll will have to disputed the entire charge. Thank you.",Disappointed

If it were the $9.99 1 month I probably would have let this go, but I can’t afford to lose almost $50. DON’T DOWNLOAD. Update:  So as you can see the developer has given me the same bogus answer as every single unhappy person, but my favorite is that they say that you get charged 24 hours before the trial ends. So no, it’s not a 7 day free trial, it’s more like 6 (but better cancel a day early because you obviously can’t trust them). As usual, the people at BetterMe are absolutely no help.",Don’t download

I read through some of the other reviews about not being able to cancel it and the ‘better me’ responses on how to stop the subscriptions THEIR RESPONSES DONT WORK EITHER!!

1,2018-01-27 02:05:23,First off the three day trial is a joke. I was charged $9.99 a total of 8 times because the app errors out when you try to use the 3day trial and charges you instead. I deleted this scam of an app and got a refund straight from Apple. Avoid this deliberate scam of an app that has far less content for the same price as other health and fitness apps.  Response to developer:  I would love to have been able to have a 3 day trial but I was charged 8 times in 20 minutes because your app continued to have errors every time I tried to sign up. Fix your app so that it doesn’t keep charging someone over and over. Once you subscribe once it shouldn’t continue to over lap and subscribe 8 times. My wife wanted to use your app but because of this poor design decision I’ve deleted it and got my refund from Apple. BTW I know how the subscription system works. It’s hard to unsubscribe when you’ve already been charged 79.92.....,This app is terrible.
1,2018-01-04 01:06:41,I never bought this app and it has taken $42 from me. DONT GET IT. I just figured out what the problem was. Super upset. 000000000 stars,Stole my money

1,2017-11-20 13:32:59,"This app is not as advertised. I was prompted on snap chat and decided to download the app as my wedding is coming up soon so I’m trying to get more out of my already active lifestyle. Anyways, it stayed it was free but as soon as I downloaded it I was prompted to confirm my billing. I wasn’t sure if this was from the new update from Apple as I hadn’t installed any apps since the latest update. So, I confirmed. Then the app prompts you to start inputting information as if the app is free. About half way through it then says sign up for your FREE 3 day trial and then get billed 19.99 a month after that?! That’s more than a basic gym membership and the price of a full membership at planet fitness and Golds Gym. So then I screen shot their billing process information. I didn’t continue but if you do not use all of your 3 days consecutively you forfeit the remaining time. All of this seems sketchy. Also your time starts from the moment you sign up so don’t sign up at night! Apps like these consumers should be able to report to Apple as ripoffs.",False advertisement
